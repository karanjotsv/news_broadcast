        "trs": ">P > >P  SENIOR CORRESPONDENT ST HARRIGAN HAS DETAILS FROM ATLANTA, HOME OF THE CDC.  Reporter: WHEN THE ANTIVIRAL PILL THAT YOU CAN TAKE FROM HOME HIT THE MARKET ONE YEAR AGO, IT WAS SO EFFECTIVE AGAINST COVID, THERE WERE FEARS OF SHORTAGES. NOW THE PRODUCTION LEVELS ARE HIGH, A DIFFERENT PROBLEM IS OCCURRING. NOT ENOUGH DOCTORS ARE PRESCRIBING IT. MANY ARE NOT FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH THE NEW DRUG.  IT TAKES TIME TO EDUCATE PHYSICIANS AND PHARMACYISTS ABOUT BRAND NEW MEDICINES AND HOW THEY SHOULD BE USED. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID NOT REALLY KNOW HOW TO DO THIS SO DOCTORS WERE NOT EDUCATED VERY WELL ABOUT IT.  Reporter: A RECENT STUDY BY SEVERAL OTHER UNIVERSITIES SHOWING 11% OF COVID PATIENTS TAKING THE ANTIVIRAL PILL. BLACK IN HISPANIC PEOPLE ARE 1-THIRD LESS LIKELY TO BE SUBSCRIBED THE PI PILLS. IT SHOULD BE AVOIDED WITH OTHER DRUGS AND ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAY PAXLOVID COULD SAVE MORE LIVES BUT IT IS NOT BEING USED. CURRENTLY, JUST 20% OF THOSE, AGE 65 AND OLDER WHO HAVE COVID ARE TAKING THE PILL, THEY CAN KEEP THEM OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.  WHEN PEOPLE TEST AT HOME IF THEY ARE POSITIVE, THE FIRST THOUGHT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN SHOULD HAVE IS AM I ELIGIBLE FOR TREATMENT?  NOT ONLY PAXLOVID ALSO REDUCES THE RISK OF LONG-TERM COVID AND THE CDC'S STUDIES REVEAL IT IS EFFECTIVE WHETHER OR NOT THE PATIENT HAD BEEN VACCINATED.  >PAXLOVID MUST BE TAKEN EARLY WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE OR SIX DAYS OF SYMPTOMS.  STEVE HARRIGAN IN ATLANTA, THANK YOU. > PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS BEEN BUSY FILLING THE JUDICIARY BENCH DURING HIS FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE WHITE HOUSE.  THE HONORABLE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON.  Reporter: IN HIS FIRST TWO YEARS, 99 JUDGES HAVE TAKEN THE BENCH INCLUDING JUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON. THE PRESIDENT STILL HAS 83 VACANCIES TO FILL IN THE NEW YEAR.  HE'S GOING TO STRUGGLE APPOINTING AS MANY AS TRUMP. HE CAN ONLY APPOINT TO VEY VACANCIES.  Reporter: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD 84 ADDRESSED TO THE BENCH.  THE BIDEN TEAM LEARNED HERE PROBLEM.  Reporter: PART OF THE URGENCY WAS PRESSURE TO UNDO THE RIGHT WORK TURN OF THE COURT DURING TRUMP'S TERM. THE NATIONWIDE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION. TRUMP'S THREE PICKS WERE IN THE CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY, THAT LED TO ANGRY PROTESTS AT THE COURT AND THE HOMES OF JUSTICES, THREATENS TO IMPEACH JUSTICES. SOME PROGRESSIVES HAVE OPENLY CALLED FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. COURT WATCHERS ARE CONCERNED.  FOR ACTIVISTS TO BE CALLING RESIGNATIONS AND THAT SORT OF THING, IT REALLY UNDER CUTS AND CORRODES THE AMERICAN PUBLIC'S FAITH AND THE IMPARTIALITY AND NEUTRALITY OF THESE JUSTICES.  SOME DEMOCRATS FEAR A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT IN 2024 COULD MOVE THE MAJORITY FURTHER TO THE RIGHT. BRET.  DAVID, THANK YOU. > AS AMERICANS GRAPPLE WITH RISING INFLATION CONTINUES TO AND AT LEAST ONE MARKET HAD SEEN PRICES DROP. USED CARS. GROWING TRENDS CONTINUE IN 2023. WE LOOK AT WHAT'S DRIVING PRICES LOWER AND WHAT CAR BUYERS SHOULD BE PREPARED FOR.  Reporter: GOOD NEWS FOR BUYERS WHO HAD BEEN PRICED OUT OF THE MARKET THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. USED CAR PRICES DROPPED NEARLY $3,000 FROM THEIR PEAK IN FEBRUARY. THE AVERAGE COST OF A VEHICLE WAS $23,000 IN NOVEMBER, THE LATEST MONTH WE HAD DATA FOR. EARLIER THIS YEAR, NEW CAR INVENTORIES DRIVEN BY PANDEMIC-RELATED COMPUTER CHIPS AND OTHER PART SHORTAGES LED TO A USE CAR BUYING FRENZY. THE LATEST CONSUMER PRICE INDEX SHOWS NEW VEHICLE PRICES ARE STILL UP EVEN AS PRICES ON USED CARS HAD FALLEN.  THEY COULD KEEP DROPPING 10% TO 20% THE NEXT YEAR BUT THE OWNER OF THIS DEALERSHIP IS NOT SOLD ON THAT.  YOU GOT TO SELL A USED CAR AND IF YOU GET RIDICULOUS LOW PR PRICING, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SELL A NEW CAR. I CAN'T SEE THE USED CARS KEEP ONGOING DOWN.  Reporter: INTEREST RATES HAVE TICKED UP ABOUT A PERCENTAGE POINT ON CAR LOANS IN THE PAST YEAR. FEDERAL RESERVE CONTINUES TO HIKE RATES TO FIGHT INFLATION. EVEN IF THE CAR IS LESS EXPENSIVE, BORROWING IS GOING TO COST YOU MORE. BRET?  ALL RIGHT, GRADY, THANK YOU POINT. > UP NEXT, CONCERNING OPERATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND RUSSIA AS UKRAINE FENCED OFF DRONE ATTACKS, WE'LL TAKE YOU LIVE TO KYIV TO A REPORT. 20221230233603.276|20221230234037.801",

        "trs": "> 300 PEOPLE A DAY IN THE UNITED STATES ARE DYING FROM FENTANYL AS A RESULT OF THE OPEN BORDER.  IT IS TIME WHEN REPUBLICANS WILL BEGIN ON TUESDAY TO SHUT THE DOOR DOWN TO PERFORMOVER SIGHT ON MYORKAS AND THE ADMINISTRATION.  LET'S HAVE A FIGHT AND WE GOT OUR GLOVES ON, LET'S GO AT IT. THE COUNTRY AS I SAID BEFORE IS SICK OF IT. THEY WANT THE TWO PARTIES TO TRY TO DO SOME CONSTRUCTIVE THINGS TOGETHER.  COMING INTO THE END OF 2022. REPUBLICANS WILL TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, THE QUESTION IS WHAT COMES NEXT. STEVE SCALISE OUTLINING THE FLOOR'S SCHEDULE. REPUBLICANS ARE FOCUSED ON THE ISSUES FACING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE FIRST BILL OF THE 118TH CONGRESS REFLECTED AND ADDRESSING THE ARMY ARREST AGENTS AND BORDER AND CRIME CRISIS. THE THREAT FROM CHINA AND SHARING PROTECTION FOR LIFE AND THOSE WHO STAND FOR. WITH THAT, LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL. KIMBERLEY STRASSEL AND RADIO COAST HUE HEWITT AND OLIVER BEAVERS. FIRST, THEY HAVE TO GET A LEADER AND THAT'S UP FIRST ON TUESDAY WHETHER KEVIN McCARTHY HAS THE VOTE OR NOT.  I DON'T THINK ANYTHING HAS CHANGED SINCE LAST WEEK. THE KNUCKLE HEAD CAUCUS IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO CALL IT GOT FIVE MEMBERS AND NONE OF THEM HAVE MOVED AND NONE OF THIS SCALISE AGENDA LAID OUT TODAY CAN MOVE FORWARD OR NOR CANO OVERSIGHT. WHILE THERE ARE A LOT OFOVER SIGHTS TO BE DONE, NONE OF THOSE GET STARTED UNTIL ONE OF THOSE FIVE AT LEAST SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP AND LET THE REPUBLICANS ROLL OUT THE AGENDA.  DOES IT XHANG AT ALL OR DO YOU GET A SENSE OF REPUBLICANS ON THE HILL THAT THERE IS MOMENTUM OVER McCARTHY'S WAY OR HE'S ON THIN ICE?  YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN SEEING LETTERS TRICKLING OUT FROM RANK AND FILE AND REPUBLICANS AND BATTLEGROUND AREAS THAT BIDEN WWON. 15 MORE RELEASED YESTERD AND WE SAW A DIFFERENT GROUP COMING OUT WITH LETTERS TODAY AS WELL. THESE LETTERS WON'T BE COMING OUT IF THEY WERE FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH. THERE IS THIS GENERAL BELIEVE WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE THAT THERE ARE AREARE MORE NO VOTES THAT A PRIVATE AND WE'LL SEE IN JANUARY. WHETHER IT IS A PATTERN OR WE SEE ACTION COMING IN FROM REPUBLICANS. THIS COULD BE -- CHIP ROY AND SOME OF THE FRESHMEN AND ANNA LUNA TOLD STEVE BANNON ON HIS RADIO SHOW THAT SHE MAY BE SIGNALLING THAT SHE MAY NOT SUPPORT HIM. THE NUMBERSES ARE NOT CLEAR. IF YOU TALK TO REPUBLICANS, THEY'RE ASKING ME WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN AND THAT'S A BAD SIGN WHEN YOU ARE ASKING A REPORTER VERSES THEM OF KNOWING WHERE THI THITHIS IS GOING TO GO.  KIMBERLY, WHAT ABOUT THE AGENDA THEY ARE SEEKING AND THE FIRST PART OF NEW CONGRESS ASSUMING THEY COULD GET A LEADER FIGURE OUT BY TUESDAY. THE BALANCING THAT WITH THE INVESTIGATION THEY SEEK?  YES, THAT'LL BE A BIG \"IF,\" LOOK, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS WHAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN AND THAT THE BIDEN LEGISLATIVE AGENDA IN ITS MOST SWEEPING FORM IS NOW OVER. YOU WILL SEE REPUBLICANS TRYING TO DO A BUNCH OF THESE BILLS AND MANY OF THEM WILL BE MESSAGING. THE BIGGEST SHOT THEY HAVE FOR GETTING SOMETHING DONE IS TAKE SOME OF THESE MUST-PASS BILLS, SPENDING BILL AND THE DEBT LIMIT INCREASE, PFIZER-RENEWABLE AND SAY TO DEMOCRATS YOU NEED OUR VOTES FOR THESE AND MAKE SOME DEMANDS AND MUCH THEY DID OF THE REPEAL VACCINE MANDATE AND THEY HAVE TO DECIDE HOW TO BALANCE THAT WITW WITWITH OVOVERSIGH OVOVE OVERSIGHT. THEY DON'T WANT THAT OVERSIGHT TO DOMINATE ALL THE HEADLINES.  ANOTHER TOPIC AFTER MULTI-YEAR EFFORT TO GET FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TAXES AND THEN RELEASE THEM. THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE DID THAT JUST TODAY. TAKE A LISTEN AT THE LAWMAKER THERE.  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT THIS ALARMING, NON-COMPLIANCE OF THE MANDATORY PRESIDENTIAL AUDIT. THEY CAN'T TAKE OUR WORDS FOR IT. THEY NEED TO SEE THE RETURNS THEMSELVES.  THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE HAVE UNLEASHED THE NEW CRITICAL WEAPON THAT OVERTURNS DECADES OF PRIVACY PROTECTION. POLITICAL TARGETING IN CONGRESS' ENEMY'S LIST IS BACK.  SO TAXES DID COME OUT TODAY IF YOU LOOK AT THE FORMER PRESIDENT PAID, $2,750. AND 0 IN 2020. NOW, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS, OBVIOUSLY, THE 0 IS NOT AN EASY THING TO TALK ABOUT FOR DEMOCRATS. BUT, IN THE BIG PICTURE, WHERE DOES THIS LAND POLITICALLY?  IT LEADS HERE AND THERE IS NO LEAD. I READ EVERY STORY OF THE TAXES COMING OUT, IT MAY LEAD WITH A DIFFERENT THING. HE ONLY PAID $4 BILLION AND NOT IN 2020. HE GOT HIT BY THE STATE'S LOCAL TAX EXEMPTION REPEAL. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS. THE REAL STORY IS THE PRECEDENT AND NOT THE PARTICULARS. I READ ONE STORY BY JEFF LAUREN, THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR CALLING IT WAYS AND MEANS. SHE'S BEEN IN LINE FOR THE PRESIDENCY AND SHE HAS POSSIBLE CONFLICTS LARGER THAN DONALD TRUMP. HE'S A BILLIONAIRE AND HE PAYS A LOT OF TAXES IN SOME YEARS AND NOT MUCH IN ANOTHER. I AM NOT SURPRISED OF THIS STORY. > LAST FRIDAY, WINNER AND LOSER FOR THE YEAR. GO AHEAD.  SO MY WINNER ARE REPUBLICANS IN NEW YORK AND FLORIDA. THEY HAVE GIVEN A LOT OF CREDIT TO RP RON DeSANTIS AND LEE ZEL LOSER IS ALSO FROM NEW YORK, IT IS GEORGE SANTOS BUT ALSO A MIX OF DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN OPERATIONS THAT FAILED TO NOTICE THIS AS WELL AS A MEDIA. \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" DID DO A PIECE, THERE WAS A LOCAL REPORT THAT DIDN'T GET ATTENTION BUT ESSENTIALLY SANCHEZ WAS ABLE TO FABRICATE MUCH OF HIS BACKGROUND AND GET ELECTED AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT MOST OF THAT IS NOT TRUE AND THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT FOR DEMOCRATS IF THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO A BETTER JOB FINDING IT OUT.  KIMBERLY, WINNERS OR LOSERS SNS.  MY WINNERS ARE THE NATIONS' PARENTS AFTER A WEEK OF COVID LOCKDOWN AND THEY ARE GETTING POLITICIANS TO PAY FOR THEIR RIGHTS. THE BORDER IS A MESS AND A LOT OF AMERICANS INCLUDING ME CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE STILL HAS A JOB.  ALL RIGHT, WINNER OR LOSER?  FOR HOLLYWOOD, \"TOP GUN:MAVERICK\" WENT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS WORLDWIDE. GO TOM CRUISE! THE LOSERS, SADLY, IS AFGHAN WOMEN, COMPLETING A 15-MONTH ECLIPSE FOR DARKNESS FOR ALL THE GIRLS AND WOMEN OF AFGHANISTAN THAT BEGAN WITH THE SCAMPER FROM AFGHANISTAN IN AUGUST OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR.  NICE JOB, PANEL. HAPPY NEW YEAR, I WILL SEE YOU IN 2023.  HAPPY NEW YEAR. \u266a > IT IS THE LAST FRIDAY, 2022 AND THIS IS TIME FOR OUR BEST OF THE YEAR EDITION OF NOTABLE QUOTES.  HOW DO YOU BELIEVE THIS WAR ENDS?  ONLY VICTORY. THE QUESTION IS WIN, IT WILL END.  WE'LL STAY WITH YOU AS LONG AS IT WILL TAKE?  I WISH THERE WERE PAINLESS WAY? P BRETT KAVANAUGH.  ABORTION.  FOR GOD'S SAKE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE.  THAT'S $20 AND THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE TEQUILA.  YOU DID IT, JOEL!  FLORIDA.  THERE IS NOTHING SAFE ABOUT THIS.   D DO YOU CONTINUE TO MA THAT THE BORDER IS SECURE.  I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND THE BORDER BUT IT IS NOT THE BORDER OF AMERICA.  I AM HERE BECAUSE OF UVALDE, TEXAS.  YOU DON'T DESERVE TO WEAR ONE.  ARE YOU PLANNING TO RETURN THAT MONEY?  WELL, I AM NOT GOING TO RETURN MONEY TO SOMEONE UNDER INVESTIGATION.  THE SHAMEFUL RAID AND BREAK-INTO MY HOME AT MAR-A-LAGO WAS A TRAVESTY.  CAN YOU PROVIDE A DEFINITION FOR THE WORD \"WOMAN\"?  I CAN'T  THE FIRST PEOPLE I WILL CALL WILL BE MY DAUGHTER AND HER WIFE.  REMEMBER HER LONG LIFE OF SELFLESSNESS.  IT WAS A NATURAL EVOLUTION.

        "trs": " Kennedy: HELLO, WELCOME BACK KAMALA HARRIS OUR VICE PRESIDENT RUNNING AT HER SECOND YEAR AS BP AND SHE IS FRUSTRATED WITH HER MEDIA COVERAGE, HOW DARE YOU! SHE IS NOT HOLDING BACK ABOUT IT. SHE SAT DOWN WITH \"WASHINGTON POST\" COLUMNIST JONATHAN CAPE HARD HER BIGGEST FAN BOY APPARENTLY TO REFLECT ON THE PAST YEAR. THE ENTITLING PIECE CALLED KAMALA HARRIS HAD A MOST EXCELLENT YEAR, THANKS BILL AND TED. THE LACK OF COVERAGE OR LEADERSHIP IS GETTING AND SHE COMPARES THAT TO COVERAGE OF THE SUPREME COURT'S LANDMARK ABORTION RIGHTS SAYING \"THERE ARE THINGS I HAVE DONE AS VICE PRESIDENT THAT FULLY DEMONSTRATE THE STRENGTH OF MY LEADERSHIP AS VICE PRESIDENT DOES NOT RECEIVE THE KIND OF COVERAGE THAT I THINK DOGS DID RECEIVE.\" TODD, I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED PERIODS SHE IS MAD A LANDMARK ONCE IN A GENERATION SUPREME COURT CASE GOT MORE COVERAGE THAN JUST THE FACT SHE WAS SUCH AN UNLIKABLE BOSS, A MASSIVE NUMBER OF HER STAFF RAN FOR THE EXITS.  Todd: I KNOW THAT WASN'T A WORD SALAD ANSWER BUT QUITE POSSIBLY THAT IS HER WORST ANSWER OF 2022. LIKE, WHY ARE YOU BRINGING IN DOBBS? THAT IS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRICE OF BEANS HERE. HAVING BEEN IN CALIFORNIA FOR MY THREE YEARS WHILE SHE WAS AG AND CENTER, HAVING COVERED HER AND BEEN PART OF THE MEDIA I CAN SAY THERE WAS A 100% HANDS OFF APPROACH TO KAMALA HARRIS. SHE WAS ABOVE REPROACH. ANYTHING SHE DID NO ONE COVERED CRITICALLY SO NOW SHE IS GETTING SOME SEMBLANCE, SOME MINUTE SEMBLANCE OF COVERAGE, SHE CAN'T HANDLE IT. IT IS CRITICAL. SHE HAS BEEN TASKED WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS, SHE IS DONE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM HORRIBLY, AND SHE CANNOT DEAL WITH THE FACT SO WHAT DOES SHE DO? SHE TAKES IT OUT ON US AND THE MEDIA FOR NOT GIVING HER GLOWING COVERAGE. SHE TAKES IT OUT TO YOUR POINT ON HER STAFF WHO ARE FLEEING IN RECORD NUMBERS. SHE IS NOT FIT FOR THIS JOB, SHE IS NOT DOING IT WELL, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO TOO MUCH FURTHER THAN THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF WHO SAID SHE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS WHEN IT COMES TO THIS JOB. IF JOE BIDEN, WORK IN PROGRESS HIMSELF AFTER BEING IN POLITICS FOR MY 50 YEARS SAYS THAT ABOUT YOU? THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.  Kennedy: NO. IT'S ALSO A SIGN SHE IS NOT READY TO BE PRESIDENT, WHICH, YOU KNOW, THEORETICALLY VICE PRESIDENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO STEP INTO THE TOP JOB SHOULD SOMETHING, GOD FORBID, HAPPEN. SHE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO REALLY APPOINT TO. SHE WON'T GO TO THE BORDER, SHE WON'T TALK TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO GET INTO THIS COUNTRY, SHE DOESN'T HAVE INTEL BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T READ HER BRIEFINGS FROM HER STAFF. SHE APPARENTLY IS SUCH A BAD BOSS THAT NO ONE WANTS TO BE TANGLED UP IN HER WEB OF INCOMPETENCE.  Cheryl: SHE BRINGS A LOT OF ATTENTION TO VENN DIAGRAMS. SHE LOVES THEM.  Kennedy: I LOVE A VENN DIAGRAM.  Cheryl: IT WASN'T A MERIT-BASED DECISION TO ELEVATE HER TO VP. IT WAS BASED OFF OF A SERIES OF BOX CHECKING EXERCISES JOE BIDEN SAID HE WANTED AND THEY SAID THEY WANTED SO THAT'S WHY SHE GOT THE JOB AND YET SHE STILL SEES HERSELF AS A VICTIM WHICH IS REALLY JUST AN EMBODIMENT OF TODAY'S POLITICAL LEFT. RIGHT? AND YOU GO BACK TO THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE WITH MIKE PENCE SHE WAS LIKE CRYING DURING IT SAYING HE WAS MEAN TO ME AND YOU SAY YOU WANT TO QUALITY AND I AM WOMAN HEAR ME WAR IN THE NEW CRY WHEN THEY TREAT YOU WITH AN EQUAL AND THEN SAYING THAT HE WAS MANSPLAINING BECAUSE HE TRIED TO TREAT HER AS AN EQUAL AND HAVE A DEBATE SO I THINK SHE IS AN EMBODIMENT OF TODAY'S POLITICAL LEFT PEER AG HAS NO COMPLIMENTS AND ALSO SHE CHOSE TO BE NEAR JOE BIDEN EVEN THOUGH  SHE CALLED HIM RACIST AD A SEXUAL ABUSER. HUGE FAN OTHER THAN THAT, KENNEDY.  Kennedy: OBVIOUS THAT SHE HASN'T GOTTEN GREAT COVERAGE THIS YEAR BECAUSE SHE HASN'T DONE GREAT THINGS AND SHE'S REALLY BLOWN SOME BIG OPPORTUNITIES TO SAY REALLY HORRIFIC THINGS. SO, HOW DOES THE WHITE HOUSE IN HER OFFICE REACH OUT TO THESE KIND REPORTERS AND WOULDN'T IT BE MORE IMPRESSIVE IF SHE WERE IN A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT AND ENDED WHILE?  Cheryl: ABSOLUTELY BUT THE ONLY THING SHE HAS DONE BETTER AT THIS YEAR IS GIVING MORE GAPS THAN PRESIDENT BIDEN DID HIMSELF WITH THE WAY SHE RESPONDS TO SOME OF THESE INTERVIEWS. YOU CAN ONLY GET THE SOFT HEADING INTERVIEWS YOU KNOW IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO COMPLETELY EMBARRASS HERSELF BUT IF ANYBODY ACTUALLY READ THIS \"WASHINGTON POST\" ARTICLE, WHAT A BOOT LICKING SYCOPHANTS THE AUTHOR WAS SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT QUESTION ARE SHE'S BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL SHE HAS THREE POLES HOLDING UP THE TENT, THE FIRST BALL IS HOW SHE WARNED THE WORLD OF THE DANGER OF RUSSIA. I LITERALLY SPIT OUT MY COFFEE LAUGHING WHEN I READ THIS BECAUSE I WAS LIKE WAIT, LET'S REWIND TO TEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE HEARD MITT ROMNEY SAID THE END OBAMA LAUGHING AT THE TIME SAYING YOU ARE OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  Kennedy: THE 80s WITH THEIR FOREIGN POLICY.  Dr. Nicole: PLUS OF THAT ACTUAL MEETING SHE WAS DISCUSSING RUSSIAN INVASION SHE TALKED ABOUT HOW EUROPE HADN'T SEEN ANY DISCOURSE. SINCE WORLD WAR II FORGETTING EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED. IT WAS SUCH A SLAP IN THE FACE.  Cheryl: PLEASE DON'T TELL THAT TO ANY FORMER SOVIET SATELLITE WHERE THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY SENT BACK TO SERFDOM. AND IMPOVERISHED UNDER COMM COMMUNIST --  Dr. Nicole: IT'S HORRIBLE WHAT HAPPENED SINCE WORLD WAR II IN EUROPE.  Kennedy: OR LESS JUST GLOSS OVER THAT, DOES SHE NOT KNOW? THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW. ARE THERE GAPS IN THE HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE?  Cheryl: I DON'T THINK SHE KNOWS.  Kennedy: I AGREE. I DON'T THINK THAT'S FORGIVABLE.  Dr. Nicole: IF YOU ARE THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN YOUR HEART BEAT LIKE A HEARTBEAT AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENCY KNOW THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE WORLD.  Dr. Nicole: DUM XP FOR ALL SHE DID WAS READ THE MEMO. SHE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT IT WAS OVER AN EMAIL.  Cheryl: TO YOUR POINT THAT AUTHOR TALKED ABOUT THE SCAREDY CONFERENCE IN FEBRUARY, THE ASIAN PACIFIC CORPORATION AND HER WORK AND MARRIAGE EQUALITY BURIED I WILL GO BACK TO HER OWN OFFICE AND THE WHITE HOUSE. REMEMBER THEY THREW HER OUT THERE IMMEDIATELY IN 2021? THEN THEY PULLED HER BACK, SO SHE HAS NO ONE TO BLAME BUT THE WHITE HOUSE OF THE BITE THE BUY DEMONSTRATION WHO SAW HER OUT THERE WITH THAT AWKWARD UNCOMFORTABLE LAUGH COME AROUND TO?  WHICH TIME? WHEN I ARRIVE IN HELL THAT LAUGH WILL BE PLAYING ON A LOOP.  THEY ARE PLAYING IN GUANTANAMO.  IT'S WORSE THAN WIRE BOARDING THOUGH MY STOMACH WATERBOARDING.  IT REALLY IS.  THE BIDEN DEMONSTRATION MOSTLY USE THE CIA TO SPY ON PEOPLE. NOT FORGOT WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY. I HAD A GOOD POINT. WHAT WAS I GOING TO SAY?  THAT HAPPENS TO THE VICE PRESIDENT EVERY DAY.  Todd: YOU COULD BE VP.  NO, NO, STOP! TODD REIGNITED IT I'VE GOT IT. I WAS GOING TO SAY THIS IS ALSO, GOT THEM TO REMEMBER I REMEMBER THIS IS REALLY EMBARRASSED. THE REALITY IS THIS WOMAN HAS HAD SO MUCH MEDIA TRAINING AND SHE IS STILL THIS BAD. THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO SAY.  SOLID, GIRL.  BRINGING IT FULL-CIRCLE.  Cheryl: WE HAVE A FOX NEWS ALERT, WE ARE AWAITING THE NEWS CONFERENCE IN IDAHO, HAVE YOU HEARD THERE IS A SUSPECT IN CUSTODY CHARGED WITH LAST MONTH'S MURDER OF FOUR COLLEGE STUDENTS? HE IS IN PENNSYLVANIA PEER AND WE ARE LEARNING MORE DETAILS, WE'LL BRING ALL OF THAT TO YOU LIVE, AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE COMING UP NEXT, A FED UP BAKERY OWNER HAD ENOUGH AFTER HIS SAN FRANCISCO SHOP WAS BROKEN INTO FOR THE SIXTH TIME. CROOKS MAKING OFF WITH AN INDUSTRIAL SAFE THAT WAS BOLTED TO THE FLOOR! HIS FIERY MESSAGE TO DEMOCRAT LEADERS IS NEXT.  Cheryl: FOX NEWS ALERT AS WE AWAIT AN POLICE UPDATE FROM MOSCOW, IDAHO, SUSPECT ARRESTED OVERNIGHT IN CONNECTION WITH THE BRUTAL UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO MURDERS LAST MONTH. HE HAS NOW BEEN IDENTIFIED AND WAS REPORTEDLY TAKEN INTO CUSTODY IN EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA EARLY THIS MORNING. HE AWAITS EXTRADITION TO IDAHO. NOW, BACK TO OUR SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE. WILLIAM.  CHERYL, WHAT WE DON'T KNOW YET IS WHAT CONNECTED THE SUSPECT OF THE CRIME. WAS AT THE PICTURE OF THAT WHITE ALANTRA? MAYBE HIS DNA WAS IN AN EXISTING LAW-ENFORCEMENT DATABASE AND BLOOD AT THE SCENE CONNECTED HIM TO THE CRIME OR DID HE HAVE A PRIOR RELATIONSHIP TO ONE OF THE VICTIMS? AS MENTIONED LAST NIGHT IN PENNSYLVANIA SOME 25,000 MILES AWAY FROM IDAHO, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE ARRESTED THE SUSPECT 28-YEAR-OLD BRIAN CHRISTOPHER KOHBERGER AGAIN 3:00 A.M. LAST NIGHT. THE JUDGE TO GRANTED NO BAIL AND OF COURSE DEBITED AT THE 21-YEAR-OLD MADISON LOGAN, KAYLEE GONZALEZ, 20-YEAR-OLD LASAGNA NOODLE, AND 20-YEAR-OLD ETHAN CHAPIN. THEY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN STABBED MULTIPLE TIMES WITH A LARGA LARE KNIFE AND NO SIGNS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. TWO OF THE FEMALE ROOMMATES WERE IN AT THE TIME AND THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT WILL HOPEFULLY LEARN A LOT MORE THAN BUT UNTIL NOW, MOSCOW POLICE HAVE REALLY BEEN TIGHT-LIPPED. LET'S HOPE WE GET MORE DETAILS.  Cheryl: AS THEY HAVE BEEN FOR WEEKS AND HOPEFULLY THIS BREAK IN THE CASE IS SOMETHING THAT THE FAMILIES CAN HOLD ONTO THEM ABLY START TO GET SOME ANSWERS FOR THEM. WILLIAM LA JEUNESSE LIFE OR ASK HIM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE UPDATE WE APPRECIATE IT. SPEECH OF THE OWNER OF A POPULAR FRENCH BAKERY IN SAN FRANCISCO IS CALLING OUT HIS DEMOCRATIC MAYOR AND GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM AS WELL AS SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI AFTER EIGHT SHOP WAS BROKEN INTO FOR THE SIXTH TIME. THE LATEST BREAK AND KIRKS TOOK iPADS, THE CASH REGISTER, EVEN A BOLTED DOWN SAFE. NEIGHBORS AND SHOCK WORKERS SAID THEY HAVE HAD IT WITH LAWLESSNESS.  ALL OF THE LEADERS NEED TO BE PITCHING AND PAID YOU CAN'T HAVE BUSINESSES GETTING BROKEN INTO, WHERE ARE THE POLICE?  IT'S JUST SAD. YOU KNOW, EVERYONE PUTTING THEIR EFFORT IN THIS PLACE AND WE TRY TO MAKE IT NICE. AND IT HAPPENS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. SPEECH TO THE BAKERY'S OWNER HAD THIS MESSAGE FOR DEMOCRAT LEADERS ON INSTAGRAM. IF YOU CANNOT PROTECT SAN FRANCISCO'S SMALL LOCAL FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESSES, HOW CAN OUR CITY THRIVE? IT HAPPENS OVER AND OVER NOTHING CHANGES. PLEASE, SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA LEADERS DO MORE TO CARE FOR OUR CITY AND SMALL BUSINESS, WE DESERVE BETTER. YOU KNOW, TODD, HOW DID WE ARRIVE AT THIS POINT WHERE THIS IS NORMAL IN PLACES LIKE SAM FOR THIS GO?  Todd: BECAUSE THE LEADERS IN THE FAR LEFT BLUE CITIES JUST DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CONSTITUENTS. THAT'S NOT HOW HORRIBLY. THEY CARE ABOUT THEMSELVES. WE HAVE SO MANY EXAMPLES OF RULES FOR THE, NOT FOR ME AND THEY HAVE THE BEST SECURITY AND YET HE IS HE WAS HAPPENING TO AMERICAN CONSTITUENTS. USED HERE TO PLAY AND THE VOICE OF THESE PEOPLE. THING OF THE EFFORT THEY TOOK IN BUILDING THEIR BUSINESS, THEY ARE NOT ACCOUNTANTS THEY CAN'T JUST GET UP AND MOVE AND GO TO ANOTHER LOCATION AND START A NEW LIFE. THEY PUT SO MUCH TIME AND EFFORT YOU CAN'T REPLICATE THAT IN THE NEW CITY LIKE THAT. TO THAT POINT, THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS, RIGHT? YOU'RE THE LAUNDRY LIST OF POLITICIANS THEY WERE CALLING OUT. I WOULD ADD ONE MORE NAME TO THE LIST. THE SMALL BUSINESS LIAISON ALSO FROM THAT AREA, HER NAME? KAMALA HARRIS. WHERE SHE ON THIS?  GOOD POINT.  Lisa: KENNEDY, IN AN MR. GRAHAM POST SHE ASKED HOW CAN A BUSINESS SURVIVE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT?  Kennedy: SAN FRANCISCO WAS ONE OF THE BEST CITIES IN THE COUNTRY FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS, PHENOMENAL PLACE CULTURALLY WITH A BEAUTIFUL SETTING AND THEY HAVE DRIVEN IT INTO THE GROUND. I BLAME GAVIN NEWSOM WHEN HE WAS THE MAYOR SAN FRANCISCO, KAMALA HARRIS WHEN SHE WAS THE D.A., NOTHING HAS GOTTEN BETTER. THEIR SENSE OF JUSTICE IS COMPLETELY UPSIDE DOWN. NOT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. THEY WERE CALLED BAIRD D8 CHESA BOUDIN AND STILL, THE CITY WILL TAKE SOME TIME BUT THIS DELL MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE HOW THEY PROSECUTE TIME IN THE CITY. THEY DON'T HAVE TO OVER INCARCERATE AND OVER CRIMINALIZE EVERY BEHAVIOR, BUT PEOPLE LIKE THIS TO THEIR POINT. THEY ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING. YOU WANT SMALL BUSINESSES TO DO REALLY, REALLY WELL AND SUCCEED IN YOUR CITY. THOSE ARE THE THINGS, THOSE OF THE MAGNETS THAT DRAW PEOPLE. NOW WHEN PEOPLE TAKE OF SAN FRANCISCO THEY THINK ABOUT CRIME INFESTED HUMAN WASTE ON THE SIDEWALKS, HOMELESSNESS, AND THEY HEAR STORIES LIKE THIS AND THEY'RE LIKE WELL I'LL GO ANYWHERE ELSE.  Lisa: CHERYL, TO KENNEDY'S POINT ISN'T IT GOOD AVALON ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THAT AT ALL?  Cheryl: THIS IS SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THEY SCREAM TO DEFEND THE POLICE LOUDER THAN ANYONE AND I FELT THE NEW MAYOR BECAUSE MEMBER AFTER A YEAR SHE CAME OUT AND SAID ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. WE WILL CLEAN UP THE HOMELESSNESS, WE WILL CLEAN UP DRUG ABUSE ON THE STREETS, WE WILL GET PEOPLE BACK TO THE CITY AND RESTORE THE CITY. SO FAR IT'S AN EMPTY PROMISE FROM HER. SHE IS THE ONE PERSON TO ME, GAVIN NEWSOM WAS TOO BUSY THINKING ABOUT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2024, NANCY PELOSI DOESN'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT THE CITY OBVIOUSLY, SHE IS TOO BUSY WORRYING ABOUT HER WASHINGTON CAREER. LONDON BREED HAS TO DO SOMETHING AND UNTIL SHE DOES THINGS WILL NOT GET BETTER.  Lisa: DR. SAPHIER NO PRESSURE TO TAKE US ON.  Dr. Nicole: SHE TOOK OVER FOR CHESA BOUDIN OVER THE SUMMER, HER OFFICE CONTINUES TO TOUT SHE IS REALLY CRACKING DOWN SPECIFICALLY ON DRUG CRIMES, YET THERE HAS BEEN A 20% INCREASE IN ARRESTS BUT THE PROSECUTION RATES HAVE BEEN THE SAME. IS SEWER MAINS ALL OBJECTS BUT YOU HAVE THESE PROGRESSIVE LEGISLATORS LIKE AOC SAYING WE CAN'T PUNCH THEM I PUNISH PEOPLE WHO STEAL BECAUSE THEY NEED THESE THINGS, DIAPERS AND FORMULA THEIR CEILINGS BUT NO ONE NEEDS THE iPAD DESPITE WHAT MY CHILDREN SAY, IT'S A WANT, NOT A NEED. THEY ARE BREAKING INTO SAFES. YOU HAVE TO PUNISH THESE CRIMINALS BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T PUNISH THEM THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO IT OVER AND OVER LIKE WE ARE SEEING.  Lisa: WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE, FOX NEWS ALERT AS WE AWAIT A PRESS CONFERENCE IN MOSCOW, IDAHO. A SUSPECT IS KNOWN CUSTODY IN CONNECTION WITH THE MURDERS, OF FOUR COLLEGE STUDENTS LAST MONTH, THAT SUSPECT IS THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY IN PENNSYLVANIA.

        "trs": " Rich: PRESIDENT BIDEN IS RAPIDLY FILLING OPEN FEDERAL JUDGE'S SEAT. BIDEN'S 99 LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS SO FAR ARE THE MOST OF ANY PRESIDENT AT THIS POINT IN HIS TENURE SINCE GEORGE W. BUSH. THAT STREAK LIKELY CONTINUES FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS AFTER SENATE DEMOCRATS ADD A SEAT TO THEIR MAJORITY NEXT WEEK. DAVID SPUNT IS LIVE IN WASHINGTON WITH MORE.  HI, RICH. AS WE KNOW PRESIDENTS COME AND GO EVERY 4 OR 8 YEARS. FEDERAL JUDGES STAY ON THE BENCH FOR DECADES. LONG AFTER A PRESIDENT LEAVES OFFICE. GETTING JUDGES ON THE BENCH HAS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR MANY RECENT ADMINISTRATIONS. PRESIDENT BIDEN NEARING HIS TWO YEAR MARK IN OFFICE, LET'S SEE WHERE THINGS STAND AS OF THIS WEEK. AS YOU SAY 99 FEDERAL JUDGES CONFIRMED SO FAR. THE MOST OF ANY RECENT PRESIDENT. THERE ARE 83 MORE VACANCIES LEFT TO FILL IN A DEMOCRATIC-CONTROLLED SENATE. NOW WE KNOW THAT 37 STILL REMAIN VACANT. 37 NOMINEES PENDING, JUDICIAL VACANCIES AND THE PRESIDENT HOPES TO GET THOSE DONE. ONE OF THE CROWNING ACHIEVEMENTS FOR THE PRESIDENT IS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BROWN JACKSON WHO ONCE SAT ON THE FEDERAL BENCH IN WASHINGTON, D.C. DEMOCRATS SEE AN URGENCY AFTER THE CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT MAJORITY IN JUNE STRUCK DOWN ROE V. WADE AND ITS NATIONWIDE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION. THAT RULING WAS HELPED IN PART BY FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S THREE HIGH COURT APPOINTMENTS HELPED BY THEN SENATE MAJORITY LEADER MITCH MCCONNELL TO MAKE THE WAY THROUGH. TRUMP ALSO HAS AN IMPRESSIVE IMPACT ON FEDERAL BENCHES WITH 84 JUDGES CONFIRMED IN HIS FIRST TWO YEARS IN OFFICE. AFTER PROGRESSIVE PUSH FOR JUDICIAL TERM LIMITS AND EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF JUSTICES TO 13 A CORRESPONDENT FOR VOX WROTE THAT BOTH JUSTICES CAWING AN AND SOTOMAYOR SHOULD STEP DOWN NOW TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT A CHANCE TO REPLACE TWO OBAMA APPOINTEES FOR TWO WHO COULD SIT ON THE BENCH FOR DECADES TO COME. WE'VE LIVED WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF RUTH BADER GINSBERG'S LATE LIFE ARROGANCE. SHE PASSED AWAY DURING TRUMP'S TERM AND WAS REPLACED BY CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT.  Rich: THANK YOU.  Julie: PETE BUTTIGIEG IS FACING BIPARTISAN CRITICISM HOW HE IS HANDLING THE MELTDOWN OF SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. SOME DEMOCRATS SAY HE COULD HAVE DONE MORE TO PREVENT THE MASS CANCELLATIONS THAT LEFT THOUSANDS OF AMERICANS STRANDED COAST TO COAST. LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL KEVIN WALLING FORMER BIDEN CAMPAIGN SURROGATE AND THE VICE PRESIDENT OF HG CREATIVE AND COLIN REID, FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE AND CAMPAIGN MANAGER FOR SENATOR SCOTT BROWN. THANK YOU FOR TALKING TO US. FIRST OFF I NEVER QUITE UNDERSTOOD WHAT LEVEL OF EXPERTISE PETE BUTTIGIEG BROUGHT TO THE TABLE WHEN IT CAME TO TRANSPORTATION. SO I'M NOT EXACTLY SHOCKED OR SURPRISED AT HIS LACK OF EXPERIENCE IS BACKFIRING. COLIN, ALL THE TENDS  TENS OF TRAVELERS WANTED WAS TO GET HOME AND GET REIMBURSED. BUTTIGIEG HASN'T LEVIED ANY CHARGES AGAINST THE AIRLINES FOR CANCELING AND REIMBURSE CUSTOMERS. WHY IS THAT?  TOUGH WEEK FOR ALL INVOLVED, JULIE. SOUTHWEST AIRLINES WILL HAVE TO ANSWER FOR THIS CATASTROPHE, AS IS SECRETARY BUTTIGIEG. AGAIN, THIS IS ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT ISN'T LIKE A TAX RETURN. YOU HAD TROUBLE FILLING IT OUT. YOUR FAMILY COULDN'T GET HOME FOR CHRISTMAS. IT WILL STICK WITH HIM FOR A WHILE. POLITICALLY SPEAKING HE HAS TWO PROBLEMS. ONE IT'S PART OF A PATTERN. WHEN THE RAILWAYS WERE HAVING THE STRIKE ISSUES IN THE FALL HE WAS CAUGHT VACATIONING IN EUROPE. OF COURSE THE SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS UNFOLDED ON HIS WATCH AND TWO, THIS IS ONE THAT DEEPEST CUTS WILL COME FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. REPUBLICANS MIGHT SAY LET THE FREE MARKETS WORK THIS OUT. IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOUTHWEST FLY A DIFFERENT AIRLINE. IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO SORT OUT THE PROBLEMS. THAT'S NOT THE ATTITUDE OF TODAY'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF WHICH PETE BUTTIGIEG WANTS TO BE A LEADER IN. IF THESE CABINET POSITIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE STEPPING STONES TO HIGHER OFFICE THIS ONE HAS BECOME MORE LIKE A LEAD BALLOON.  Julie: A DEMOCRAT FROM CALIFORNIA KHANNA IS PUTTING THE FIRE UNDER BUTTIGIEG'S FEET. HE SAID NEARLY SIX MONTHS AGO BERNIE SANDERS AND I CALLED FOR BUTTIGIEG TO IMPLEMENT FINES AND PENALTIES ON AIRLINES FOR CANCELING FLIGHTS. WHY WERE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS NOT FOLLOWED? THIS MESS WITH SOUTHWEST COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. WE NEED BOLD ACTION. DO YOU AGREE BUTTIGIEG HAS DROPPED THE BALL?  JULIE, THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS IN THIS WEEK OF A DISASTER FOR SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS LEVELED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FINES PREVIOUS TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON, SECURED $6 HUNDRED MILLION IN REIMBURSEMENT UNDER BUTTIGIEG'S LEADERSHIP. YOU'LL SEE CONGRESSMAN CALL THE SOUTHWEST AIRLINES LEADERSHIP BEFORE CONGRESS. THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE $50 BILLION THAT THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS GAVE TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY INCLUDING $7 BILLION FOR SOUTHWEST. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THAT WAS USED FOR STOCK BUYBACKS AND NOT IMPROVING THEIR OPERATIONAL CONDITIONS HEADING INTO THIS HOLIDAY SEASON. THE WRITING WAS ON THE WALL. I THINK ALSO SECRETARY BUTTIGIEG WILL BE CALLED BEFORE CONGRESS TO ANSWER ON THAT FRONT AS WELL.  Julie: THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED FROM SOUTHWEST, BUTTIGIEG AND BEYOND. BIDEN IS CONSIDERING IF AND WHEN TO LAUNCH HIS RE-ELECTION BIDS. REPORTS SAFE DEMOCRATS ARE QUIETLY URGING THE PRESIDENT TO DELAY ANY ANNOUNCEMENT POSSIBLY EXPECTING THE INVESTIGATIONS WILL PURSUE IN JANUARY. THEY WANT TO SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT. LET ME SHOW YOU THE POLL. IT SHOWS AMERICANS DON'T WANT HIM TO RUN AGAIN AND PREFER A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE THAT'S 20 YEARS YOUNGER THAN THE CURRENT 80-YEAR-OLD PRESIDENT. A POLL ASKS HOW OLD SHOULD THE PRESIDENT BE? 50%, 51-65. 8% HAVE HIM AT BIDEN'S AGE. COLIN, AND KEVIN YOUR QUICK REACTION.  IT'S THE END OF THE YEAR, JULIE. A YEAR OF REFLECTION. A TIME TO LOOK BACK. 2022 DIDN'T GO THE WAY A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WANTED. WE'RE RUNNING AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN AGAIN IN 2024. SHAME ON US IF WE CAN'T DO A BETTER JOB THAN 2022. I REMEMBER WHEN MCCAIN FACED QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS AGE WHEN HE WAS 70. PRESIDENT BIDEN IS TEN YEARS OLDER, HE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO ANSWER THROUGHOUT THE YEARS AGO.  Julie: DO YOU SEE AGE BEING A PROBLEM FOR HIM?  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DECIDE THAT. I WAS WITH THE PRESIDENT TWO WEEKS AGO AT THE WHITE HOUSE. HE IS FIRED UP TO RUN FOR RE-ELECTION. THE INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS HE HAS SECURED. A LOT OF BIPARTISAN VICTORIES. I THINK ANY REPUBLICAN WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, SERIOUSLY IN QUESTION TAKING ON THIS PRESIDENT WITH THAT KIND OF RECORD.  Julie: WE'LL WAIT AND SEE. KEVIN WALLING AND COLIN REID, THANK YOU BOTH FOR TALKING TO US. HAPPY NEW YEAR.  Rich: DEMOCRATS ON THE HOUSE COMMITTEE HAVE JUST RELEASED SIX YEARS OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS FROM THE YEARS OF HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN AND HIS PRESIDENCY. LET'S BRING IN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT CHAD PERGRAM.  THE NEWS HERE IS JUST THAT THEY RELEASED THESE TAX RETURNS IN JUST THE PAST HOURS SO THIS WAS A BRIEF SESSION OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WE DIDN'T SEE THEM DO ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR. IT WAS MINISTERIAL, SKELETON CREW AND NO ANNOUNCEMENT. THEY RELEASED IT INTO THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. LET ME GET INTO SOME OF THE NITTY-GRITTY. MR. TRUMP PAID $750 IN TAXES HIS FIRST YEAR. LOSSES OF NEARLY $13 MILLION. TOP REPUBLICAN ON THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHARACTERIZED THE TAX RELEASE AS QUOTE PANDORA'S BOX. DEMOCRATS SOUGHT HIS TAX INFORMATION FOR YEARS. IT HAS BEEN CUSTOMARY FOR PRESIDENTS AND CONTENDERS TO RELEASE TAXES. THE FORMER PRESIDENT ARGUED HE COULD NOT RELEASE THEM BECAUSE HE WAS FACING AN AUDIT AND SAID THE PUBLIC WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE COMPLICATED. RICH.  Rich: CHAD PERGRAM LIVE FROM D.C. THANK YOU.  Julie: HE ACTUALLY READ THROUGH THAT BEFORE THAT REPORT. CHAD PERGRAM, YOU ARE MY HERO. 4,000 PAGE SPENDING BILL PACKED WITH GREEN INITIATIVES FLOWN THOUSANDS OF MILES BY JET FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SIGNATURE. NOT THE FIRST TIME HE PUT LEGISLATION ON A GAS GUZZLING FLIGHT. TOM SHILLUE WITH REACTION. CAN'T WAIT, NEXT. \u266a 20221230153818.528|20221230154333.242",

        "trs": "\u266a \u266a  THE ECONOMY! [WHISPERING] I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYMORE YOU DON'T LIKE LOOKING AT THEM. HE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT YOU. [APPLAUSE]  Lisa: HE SO CREEPY. THE WHISPER STATEMENTS MAY HAVE RAISED EYEBROWS BUT LEAVE IT TO THE MEDIA HEADLINES DECLARING IT ALL PART OF THE PRESIDENT'S BRILLIANT YEAR THEY SAY.  Joey: ARGUING THE PAST 12 MONTHS HAVE BEEN SURPRISINGLY GOOD FOR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND INFLATION IS COMING DOWN FROM NEAR RECORD HIGHS AND THE PRICE OF A GAS: AN BIDEN TO LEGISLATIVE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND EVEN BIPARTISAN WINS. BIDEN CAN CELEBRATE BETTER THAN EXPECTED MIDTERM ELECTION RESULTS. YOU CAN'T NECESSARILY ARGUE WITH BIDEN BEING EFFECTIVE IN ACCOMPLISHING SOME OF THE POLICY GOALS THAT HE AND HIS PROGRESSIVE PARTY SET OUT TO ACCOMPLISH. THEY ARE TWO METRICS WHEN IT COMES TO GRADING OR WEIGHING A POLITICIAN, ESPECIALLY THE PRESIDENT'S EFFECTIVENESS. ONE IS, ARE THEY DOING WHAT IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY? ARE WE IN A GOOD PLACE KAMARA THINGS GOOD AND AMERICANS MOSTLY HAPPY? AND THE OTHER ONE IS ARE YOU ACCOMPLISHING THE AGENDA WITH YOUR GROUP OF FOLKS LEADING THE WAY AND DIRECTING YOU? ON THE FIRST ONE, THE POLLS SAY NO, HE'S NOT DOING THINGS AMERICANS ARE HAPPY WITH. WE HAVE POLES TO SHOW THAT. YOU FEEL THE COUNTRY IS HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, 26.1% SAYS WRIGHT, 65.3% SAYS WRONG. WITH THAT INFORMATION, THEY ARE SAYING IT WAS A GOOD YEAR.  Lisa: I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING IN POLITICS AND IT COMES DOWN TO THAT QUESTION IN 1980, ARE YOU BETTER OFF THAN FOUR YEARS AGO? THE ANSWER IS \"NO\" FOR AMERICANS. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND THAT WAS A UNIQUE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THE DOBBS HEARING AND PEOPLE VOTING ON THE ISSUE OF ABORTION. YOU WILL NOT NECESSARILY HAVING THAT HEADING INTO THE 2024 ELECTION. THIS WILL BE A HUNDRED PERCENT REFERENDUM ON JOE BIDEN. THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE FAILURES THEY HAVE HAD APPEARED WITH THAT BEING SAID, WE ARE IN A NEW ERA POLITICS. WILD WEST WITH MAIL-IN BALLOTS AND DEMOCRATS USE COVID VIRUS FOR THE PANDEMIC POLITICAL PROCESS THAT HAS CHANGED THE GAME.  Griff: YOU WORK AND A LOT OF POLITICS SO A SUFFOLK POLL COULD HAVE'S RATING AND 47% DISAGREE AND 27.3 SOMEWHAT APPROVE, 17.5% STRONGLY APPROVE. SO WHILE BIDEN AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS TOUTING SUCCESSES AND SORT OF SITTING IN THE MIDDLE GROUND, I THINK IT'S GOING WELL FOR HIM TRULY ARE A FULL SENSE OF SECURITY.  Lisa: A LOT OF IT, YOU CAN'T WEAR OUT 2024 SO MIDTERM ELECTIONS TO LOOK TO 2024 IS ESSENTIALLY MEANINGLESS, BUT IT IS RELEVANT, RIGHT? A SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES HEADING INTO THE 2024 ELECTION. AND THE FED RAISED INTEREST RATES AND THAT WILL TAKE A YEAR TO PLAY OUT. I DON'T THINK THE ECONOMY WILL LOOK BETTER HEADING INTO THE 2024 ELECTIONS. HE WILL HAVE TO ANSWER TO THAT. IT DEPENDS ON WHO REPUBLICANS RUN AND WHAT SORT OF MESSAGE THEY ARE RUNNING AND PEOPLE NEED TO HEAR HOW THIS PERSON, REPUBLICANS IS GOING TO POSITIVELY IMPACT AFTER SEEING THEIR LIFE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY JOE BIDEN. NO ONE SHOULD BE UNDERESTIMATED AT ALL.  Joey: PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHEN SUMMARIZING A YEAR, A FOUR-YEAR TERM, GAS PRICES WILL CREEP ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. I HOPE THEY GET REALLY GOOD, AND I WILL TAKE CREDIT TO GET THERE. BUT I WON'T FORGET WHO PUT THEM WHERE THEY WERE. IF I'M IN THE LANDSCAPING BUSINESS AND I PUT GASOLINE IN EVERY TOOL USED TO DO MY BUSINESS AND I LOST THAT BUSINESS OVER THE SUMMER BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD TO RUN THOSE TOOLS, I'M NEVER GOING TO FORGET THAT. WHEN HE GETS READY TO RUN AGAIN, HE IS THE GUY THAT CAN PUT ME BACK THERE AGAIN. PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND I WILL ALWAYS APPLY THE MICRO PLOT A LEADER FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING TO HELP US BUT THE POSTURE OF ALL OF YOUR POLICY SEEMS TO APPE ONE SUBSET OF AMERICANS AND ONE GROUP OF IDEALS LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE OR WHATEVER WE CALL WILL CULTURE COME I THINK A LOT OF AMERICANS WILL LOOK AT THIS AND WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. HE HAS TWO YEARS TO FIGURE IT OUT. REPUBLICANS, PLEASE, GET YOURSELF TOGETHER AND LEARN HOW TO GO OUT AND FIND YOUR VOTERS, GET THEM REGISTERED IN GEORGIA SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE REPUBLICAN WAY.  Lisa: JOE BIDEN IS THE GUY 15 SERVICE MEMBERS KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN'S AND LEFT AMERICANS BEHIND AND TURN HIS BACK ON THE NATION. I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT BEARDS MOVING ON STILL HAD TERRIFYING NEW VIDEO, A SURVIVOR IN TEXAS ATTEMPTING TO SMASH THEIR WAY TO A RANCHER'S HOME. FORMER ICE SPECIAL AGENT AND THE GRIM REALITIES OF THE BORDER CRISIS. THAT IS NEXT. \u266a \u266a  Lisa: THE CRISIS AT THE BORDER GROWING WORSE BY THE DES PERES OF THE TEXAS RANCHER RELEASING THIS VIDEO. A SUSPECTED MIGRANTS ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO BREAK INTO HIS HOME. MEANWHILE THE BORDER PATROL DEL RIO SECTOR POSTING THESE PHOTOS OF THEIR ENCOUNTERS OF 1400 MIGRANTS IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS. OUR NEXT GUEST KNOWS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF THE BORDER AND SURVIVED A BUSH THAT KILLED FELLOW I.C.E. AGENT WHEN THEY WERE ON ASSIGNMENT, RETIRED I.C.E. AGENT, SPECIAL AGENT VICTOR REBELLO JOINS US NOW. YOU KNOW, VICTOR, YOU CAN INCENTIVIZE IN LIFE AND HIS ADMINISTRATION INCENTIVIZE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, WHY?  THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE, LISA BECAUSE OF THE OPEN BORDER AND THE INVITATION THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS GIVEN TO THE REST OF THE WORLD. WE SEE THESE TYPE OF VIDEOS AND ENCOUNTERS. I INVESTIGATE SOME OF THESE DURING MY CAREER, BUT NOTHING LIKE WHAT WE SEE THE BRAZEN TYPE OF ASSAULT SEEN BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COMING INTO THE COUNTRY. I INTERVIEWED MANY RANCHERS IN THE LAST ALMOST TWO YEARS ALONG THE BORDER AND TELL YOU THE STORIES THEY HAVE GIVEN ME ABOUT THE BODIES, THE DEAD BODIES ENCOUNTERED ON T RANCHERS. YES, THE FENCE KEEP THE CATTLE ON THEIR OWN PROPERTY. BUT A LOT OF ISSUES BROKEN BY THE ILLEGALS. AND IT'S GOTTEN OUT OF HAND. WE ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WON'T DO IT SO I ALONG WITH AMERICAN PROJECT TO REPRESENT SOME OF THESE RANCHERS, A LOT OF THEM THROUGHOUT THE BORDER. AND PROVIDES THE LOW YEAR. AND HAVE FILED A LAWSUIT TO COMPEL THEM AND WE HAVE TO FILE LAWSUITS TO AS THE OWN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE PROTECTION TO THE CITIZENS  Lisa: WE HAVE A DHS SECRETARY BEING IN THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY IS NOT GROUNDS FOR DEPORTATION. SO, IT IS ALL VERY CONFUSING. BUT TALK ABOUT THE DANGERS THESE BORDER TOWNS FACE. I KNOW YOU REFERENCED SOME OF IT BUT DIG A LITTLE BIT MORE AND WHAT THESE FOLKS ARE SAYING.  YOU ARE SEEING EVERYTHING FROM SIMPLE ASSAULTS, BURG BURGLARIES, ROBBERIES, EVEN CARJACKINGS ALONG THE BORDER. SOMETIMES, YOU DON'T SEE A LOT OF THESE CASES BEING REPORTED NATIONWIDE. SOMETIMES, THE LOCAL STATIONS PICK IT UP BECAUSE IT HAPPENS AND THE COMMUNITY. BUT THE PROBLEM HERE LISA IS WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THESE KIND OF CRIMES HAPPEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY FROM PEOPLE NOT AUNT THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY AND WE HAVE A CRIMES SURGE PROBLEM IN OUR COUNTRY THAT WE MUST DEAL WITH. WE DON'T NEED ADDITIONAL PEOPLE COMING IN, MILLIONS OF THEM. AND I'M NOT SAYING ALL COMMITTING CRIMES, BUT MANY OF THEM THAT ARE COMING IN HAVE PRIOR CRIMINAL HISTORIES, DEPORTATIONS, CRIMINAL HISTORY FROM THEIR OWN COUNTRY THAT WE ARE NOT AWARE OF BECAUSE THOSE COUNTRIES DON'T REPORT TO THE DATABASES HERE THEY ARE GETTING IN. THEY ARE GETTING IN FROM COUNTRIES YOU WOULD NEVER IMAGINE. WE TALK ABOUT RUSSIA, SPECIAL INTEREST COUNTRIES WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY WHERE THEY MIGHT BE SPONSORED BY TERRORISM. THIS IS NATIONAL SECURITY OF PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE THAT WE FACE EVERY DAY NOW AND THIS IMMINENT THREAT. LET'S NOT FORGET THE CARTELS HERE THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE RIGHT NOW THAT IS NOT GETTING OUT ENOUGH. WE ARE NOT DEALING WITH MEXICO THE WAY THAT WE SHOULD IN DEALING WITH THE EMINENT THREAT OF THE CARTELS AND WHAT THEY BRING TO THE COMMUNITY. THE CARTELS ARE PRESENT IN THE COUNTRY AND YES THEY OPERATE MEXICO BUT LET ME TELL YOU THEY ARE BRINGING ILLEGAL ALIENS AND A LOT OF THEM FROM NICARAGUA GIVING US WHAT THE CARTELS CONTINUE TO ON THEM AS THEY ENTER THE COUNTRY TO ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF DESTINATIONS.  Lisa: THERE IS NO HUMAN I.D. ENCOURAGING THIS TO HAPPEN, VICTOR AVILA, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US IN BREAKING THIS ALL DOWN. WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. STILL AHEAD, HONORING AMERICAN HEROES WON ME AT A TIME. WE WILL INTERVIEW MIKE INTRODUCE YOU TO THE CHICAGO RESTAURANT WITH A TRIBUTE TO VETERANS AND TEACHERS. ALL OF THAT. STAY WITH US. \u266a \u266a 20221229133420.874|20221229133759.425",

        "trs": " Edward: THE DOW AND S&P 500 CLOSING DOWN AS CHINA CLOSING DOWN FOR COVID.  Edward: THIS JUST IN. REPUBLICAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR NASSAU COUNTY, NEW YORK HAS OPENED AN INVESTIGATION INTO GOP CONGRESSMAN ELECT GEORGE SANTOS. THE FABRICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CONGRESSMAN-ELECT SANTOS ARE STUNNING. OTHER PARTS OF THE THIRD DISTRICT MUST HAVE AN HONEST AND ACCOUNTABLE REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS. NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW. IF A CRIME WAS COMMITTED, WE WILL PROSECUTE IT.  WE HAVE TO HAVE A FRESH START FOR OUR PARTY. WE HAVE TO HAVE A NEW OPTION FOR 2024 OR WE'RE GOING TO BE YIELDING THE PRESIDENCY ONCE AGAIN TO PRESIDENT BIDEN OR TO A DEMOCRAT. THAT'S THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE.  THAT WAS ARKANSAS REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHISON ON FOX BUSINESS EARLIER TODAY. HE'S WEIGHING IN ON A POSSIBLE PRESIDENTIAL RUN FOR HIMSELF. SO IS PRESIDENT BIDEN GOING TO RUN? WHO IS LIKELY GOING TO HAVE RE-ELECTION TALKS WITH HIS FAMILY ON VACATION. HE SAYS HE WILL HAVE A DECISION NEXT YEAR. WHAT WILL THE 2024 FIELD LOOK LIKE? SAMANTHA JOE ROTH IS JOINING ME NOW. WHERE DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT COMES DOWN ON THIS? IS IT LIKELY HE RUNS AGAIN.  IF HE DOES, DOES THAT CLEAR THE FIELD ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE?  I THINK AFTER THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS, THE PARTICULARLY STRONG MID-TERM ELECTIONS FOR THE PRESIDENT AND FOR DEMOCRATS, IT IS LOOKING A LOT MORE LIKELY THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL BE THE TOP CHOICE FOR DEMOCRATS. OBVIOUSLY IF BIDEN BOWS OUT, THERE'S A BIG QUESTION OF WHO WILL BE THAT PERSON WHO IS GOING TO LEAD THE FIELD. I DO REALLY FEEL LIKE BECAUSE OF THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS, IT SEEMS LIKE NOBODY IS GOING TO CHALLENGE HIM IF HE SHOULD DECIDE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PRESIDENTIAL BID.  GAVIN NEWSOME, WE'VE HEARD, MAKING WAVES POSSIBLY THINKING ABOUT A RUN WITH THIS. HE'S VULNERABLE ON HIS COVID POLICIES FROM THE LOCKDOWN. CALIFORNIA HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST GAS PRICES IN THE NATION.  ABSOLUTELY. GAVIN NEWSOME HAS SAID THAT HE DOES NOT THINK THAT HE'S GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, AS WE KNOW, POLITICIANS LOVE TO SAY THAT AND THEN THEY RUN FOR PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, WE SAW HIM REALLY TAKING ON SOME REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS LIKE RON DESANTIS AND SOME OTHERS. WE SAW HIM PLACING BILLBOARDS IN SOME STATES TALKING ABOUT POLICIES FOR ABORTION AND TRYING TO DRIVE PEOPLE TO CALIFORNIA. IT DOES APPEAR THAT GAVIN NEWSOME DOES HAVE SOME POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS FOR SURE.  AND FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP IS IN THE RACE. THAT HASN'T SCARED AWAY RON DESANTIS, ASA HUTCHISON WHO I TALKED WITH POSSIBLY CONSIDERING A RUN FOR THIS. DO YOU FEEL LIKE THIS TIME AROUND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO GET COMPETITION ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE?  I THINK A LOT OF THE SIGNALS THAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT REPUBLICANS ARE VERY UNHAPPY WITH WHAT THEY'VE SEEN. THEY LOST THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY LOST THE SENATE, THEY LOST THE HOUSE. THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THE HOUSE THIS TIME. THAT IS NOT WITH THE HELP FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP. SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF PEOPLE NOW EMERGING. THE NUMBER 1 CHOICE HAS TO BE GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS. HIS PROFILE WAS HIGH. THAT WAS BEFORE THE MID-TERMS. YOU KNOW, AFTER THE MID-TERMS, YOU KNOW, THAT MAJOR VICTORY LOOKING AT SOMEBODY WHO WAS ABLE TO LEAD MIAMI-DADE, A REPUBLICAN, THAT IS HUGE. ALSO THE FACT THAT, YOU KNOW, HE HAS A VERY FRIENDLY LEGISLATURE. HE WILL USE THAT IN A WAY WHERE HE WILL BE ABLE TO GET LAWS PASSED THAT WILL PLAY REALLY WELL DURING THE MID-TERMS OR RATHER OBVIOUSLY THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  Edward: SO PRESIDENT TRUMP A DIVISIVE FIGURE IN THE PARTY AND OUTSIDE THE PARTY. YOU THINK THAT PLAYS INTO THE OPENING FOR RON DESANTIS TO COME THROUGH?  ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, RON DESANTIS HAS REALLY TRIED TO STAY AWAY FROM THE CONFRONTATION. YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY WE'VE SEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SPECIFICALLY TARGETING THE FLORIDA GOVERNOR. HE HAS SAID NOTHING BASICALLY. THAT REALLY SIGNALS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HE'S DECIDING TO GET INTO THIS RACE. YEAH.  WOULD IT BE A TWO-PERSON RACE OR YOU THINK WE'LL SEE A LARRY HOGAN AND ASA HUTCHISON COME IN?  I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY BE CONSIDERING A RUN FOR PRESIDENT. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RUMORS ABOUT NIKKI HALEY. SHE HAS A VERY IMPRESSIVE RESUME, THE FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR. SHE'S TEASED SOME POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS. I THINK MIKE POMPEO HAS ALSO TALKED A LOT ABOUT -- HE'S BEEN SOMEBODY THAT DOES SEEM LIKE HE HAS A LOT OF PRESIDENTIAL ASPIRATIONS. HE'S BEEN TO IOWA. HE HAS IMPRESSIVE CREDENTIALS. SO HE ALSO IS SOMEBODY THAT ISN'T A GREAT FUND RAISER. SO THAT'S A CHALLENGE FOR HIM.  Edward: INTERESTING. THANKS. THIS WILL BE ONGOING THE NEXT TWO YEARS. WE'LL HAVE FUN WITH IT. THANKS VERY MUCH. APPRECIATE IT. INCREDIBLE IMAGES OF A RESTAURANT TRANSFORMED INTO AN ICE CASTLE AFTER THE BUFFALO BLIZZARD. HEAR FROM THE OWNER. PLUS, WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO PREVENT ANOTHER AIRLINE MELTDOWN. MEET THE SOUTHWEST PILOT WHO HAS IDEAS AND A NEW STU DID SHOWING HOW PANDEMIC LEARNING LOSSES COULD LEAD TO FUTURE EARNING LOSSES. LYDIA HU ON THAT.  HI, EDWARD. THAT NEW STUDY SUGGESTING THAT LOCKDOWN RELATED LEARNING LOSS COULD COST TODAY'S STUDENTS AS MUCH AS $70,000 IN LOST EARNINGS OVER THEIR LIFETIME. WHAT WILL THAT COST THE COUNTRY?

        "trs": " Jonathan: WHAT A YEAR IT HAS BEEN AND AS 2022 WINDS DOWN, BILL HEMMER TAKES A LOOK BACK AT SOME OF THE BIGGEST HEADLINES OF THE LAST 12 MONTHS.  2022 WAS ANOTHER TURBULENT YEAR MARKED BY ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, THE ONGOING COVID PANDEMIC AND THE BIGGEST EUROPEAN CONFLICT SINCE THE SECOND WORLD WAR. THOSE STORIES AND MANY MORE DOMINATE THE HEADLINES FROM THIS PAST YEAR. THIS WAS THE THIRD YEAR OF THE COVID PANDEMIC. 300 MILLION CASES REPORTED WORLDWIDE BY EARLY JANUARY. THAT NUMBER MORE THAN DOUBLING BY DECEMBER. MOSTLY DRIVEN BY A NEW STRAIN CALLED OMICRON WHICH BECAME DOMINANT IN LATE MARCH IN THE U.S. THE NUMBERS STARTED FALLING OVER THE SUMMER. NOW WE SEE THE START OF ANOTHER POSSIBLE SURGE WHICH IS COMBINING WITH FLU AND RSV TO CREATE A SO-CALLED TRIPLEDEMIC THREATENING TO OVERWHELM AMERICA'S HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ONCE AGAIN. RUSSIA SENDING TROOPS OVER THE BORDER INTO NEIGHBORING UKRAINE IN AN ALL-OUT INVASION. VLADIMIR PUTIN LISTING VARIOUS JUSTIFICATIONS FOR THE WAR INCLUDING THAT UKRAINE WAS THREATENING RUSSIA AND WAS BEING GOVERNED BY QUOTE NAZIS, MOSCOW SEVERELY UNDERESTIMATED THE UKRAINIAN MILITARY. THEY WERE ABLE TO STOP THE RUSSIAN ADVANCE TOWARD KIEV EVENTUALLY PUSHING THE RUSSIANS BACK TO POSITIONS IN THE FAR EAST AND SOUTH. NOW UKRAINE IS ON THE OFFENSIVE. BOLSTERED BY MILITARY AID FROM MORE THAN A DOZEN COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE U.S., WHICH HAS SPENT MORE THAN $60 BILLION ARMING THE UKRAINIANS. THE WAR HAVING MAJOR ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES AROUND THE WORLD. IT HELPED FUEL THE WORST INFLATION CRISIS IN DECADES HERE IN THE U.S., WITH THE COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES SKYROCKETING THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS WAGES REMAIN LARGELY STAGNANT. THE FEDERAL RESERVE AGGRESSIVELY RAISING INTEREST RATES, HOPING TO COOL DOWN THE ECONOMY AND RELIEVE SOME OF THE INFLATIONARY PRESSURE. IN MAY, A MAJOR TRAGEDY HITTING A SMALL TEXAS TOWN. A GUNMAN KILLING 19 STUDENTS AND TWO TEACHERS AT THE ROB ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN UVALDE. IT WAS THE THIRD DEADLIEST SCHOOL SHOOTING IN AMERICAN HISTORY. IN THE AFTER MATH IT WAS REVEALED LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WERE ON THE SCENE FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR BUT DID NOT CONFRONT THE SHOOTER UNTIL MEMBERS OF THE U.S. BORDER PATROL TACTICAL UNIT ARRIVED. PERHAPS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL SUPREME COURT RULING IN DECADES CREATING SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL UPHEAVE ALL. THE COURT'S NEW CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY RULING ABSORPTION IS NOT A NATIONWIDE RIGHT. PROMPTING ABORTION BANS IN MORE THAN A DOZEN STATES. 2022 MARKED BY MULTIPLE INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. PERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT, THE CONGRESSIONAL JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE WHICH KICKED OFF TELEVISED PUBLIC HEARINGS WITH THE GOAL OF FINDING OUT WHAT LED TO THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL AND WHO WAS TO BLAME.  WE BELIEVE THIS EVIDENCE WE SET FORTH IN OUR REPORT IS MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR A CRIMINAL REFERRAL OF FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND OTHERS.  THOSE LEGAL TROUBLES ESCALATED IN AUGUST WITH THE RAID ON TRUMP'S PRIVATE RESIDENCE AT MAR-A-LAGO. HUNDREDS OF DOCUMENTS SEIZED, MANY MARKED TOP SECRET. THE FORMER PRESIDENT SAYING HE DECLASSIFIED THEM BUT NO RECORD OF THAT. POSSIBLY EXPOSING HIM TO CHARGES OF VIOLATING THE PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT. THE END OF AN ERA, QUEEN ELIZABETH II PASSING AWAY AT THE AGE OF 96. HER SON, CHARLES, BECOMING KING CHARLES III AFTER SPENDING MORE THAN 64 YEARS AS HEIR TO THE THRONE. A PAIR OF HURRICANES CAUSING BIG PROBLEMS IN SEPTEMBER. FIRST UP WAS HURRICANE FIONA BRINGING MAJOR FLOODING TO PUERTO RICO AND THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC BEFORE HEADING NORTH. IT HIT CANADA AS A CYCLONE PACKING 100 MILE-PER-HOUR WINDS AND CAUSING WIDESPREAD DAMAGE. TWO WEEKS LATER HURRICANE IAN SLAMMED INTO FLORIDA'S GULF COAST. THE MOST DEADLY HURRICANE TO HIT THE STATE IN MORE THAN 80 YEARS. OFFICIALS THERE SAY IT COULD TAKE YEARS FOR SOME COASTAL COMMUNITIES TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. THE TECH WORLD THROWN INTO TURMOIL IN LATE OCTOBER AFTER ELON MUSK COMPLETED HIS $44 BILLION TAKEOVER OF TWITTER. HE IMMEDIATELY FIRED THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES AS HE WARNED ABOUT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL SITUATION. WE ELECTED A NEW CONGRESS IN 2022. THE MID-TERMS RESULTING IN THE HOUSE FLIPPING CONTROL TO THE REPUBLICANS. BUT THERE WAS NO RED WAVE AS ANTICIPATED, WITH DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY GAINING A SEAT IN THE SENATE. AND REPUBLICANS ONLY WINNING A SLIM MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE. THE YEAR ENDING WITH A BANG LITERALLY. MAUNA LOA THE WORLD'S LARGEST ACTIVE VOLCANO RECORD BACK TO LIFE AFTER LYING DORMANT FOR ALMOST FOUR DECADES.

HE BECAME ESPECIALLY POPULAR AFTER HE DARED TO MOCK COVID LAW. WE THOUGHT WE WANT TO MEET THIS GUY AND TALK TO HIM. WE SPOKE TO HIM AT LENGTH ABOUT HOW HE MAKES THESE I HAVE YESES AND WHAT HE THINKS AS HE DOES IT.  WHAT IS PROCESS FOR CREATING ONE OF THESE VIDEOS?  THE DAMN VIDEOS WRITE THEMSELVES, TUCKER. I LOOK AT THE HEADLINES. THEY'RE DOING THAT NOW? OKAY. ONE OF THE BASIS OF COMEDY IS EXAGGERATION. RIGHT NOW REALITY IS THE MOST EXAGGERATED EXPERIENCE THAT I COULD EVER IMAGINE. JUST WHAT THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE ARE DOING, WHAT THE MEDIA IS DOING. IT'S SO ABSURD. SO THE COMEDY IN MY OPINION JUST WRITES ITSELF. ALL I DO IS FEEL LIKE ART. WHAT AM I EMOTIONALLY CHARGED ABOUT? WHETHER IT'S ANGER, HAPPINESS, JOY, EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. I THOUGHT ALL RIGHT. I HAVE AN EMOTION ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. LET ME FOLLOW THAT EMOTION AND I'LL START WRITING A SCRIPT ABOUT IT. AND ALSO, PART OF THAT PROCESS IS LOOKING FOR THE LIES, HYPOCRISY, CORRUPTION IN THE STORY UNDER THE STORY THAT IS NOT BEING SPOKEN ABOUT.

YOU HAVE A VERY KEEN EYE FOR IRONY, HYPOCRISY AND SHARPLY ATTUNED EAR TO LANGUAGE. I THOUGHT YOUR VIDEO ON MY BODY, MY CHOICE.  LET'S JUST SAY NO, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT KILLING A BABY INSIDE YOUR BODY. WELL, ARE WE TALKING ABOUT INJECTING A VERY PROFITABLE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT IN YOUR BODY? YES, WE ARE. THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE NO SAY IN THE MATTER BECAUSE IT'S YOUR BODY. SOMEONE ELSE'S CHOICE. SO MY BODY, MY CHOICE IS A FALSE STATEMENT.  Tucker: WHY IS IT MY BODY MY CHOICE WHEN IT COMES TO ABORTION AND NOT VACCINE?  I DON'T THINK MY BODY MY CHOICE IS IN WOKE CULTURE. IT'S NOT BASED ON PRINCIPAL. IF IT WAS BASED IN PRINCIPAL, IT WOULD MEAN SOMETHING WHEN IT COMES TO ALL TOPICS, ABORTIONS, VACCINES, ANYTHING. BECAUSE IT'S NOT BASED ON PRINCIPAL, IT'S BASED ON PROPAGANDA, THE REALITY SHIFTS. IT'S IT'S YOUR BODY, YOUR CHOICE. HAVE A CELEBRATION. WE'LL CELEBRATE YOU FOR MAKING AN EMPOWERED CHOICE. YOU DON'T WANT A VACCINE? IT'S THE --  Tucker: YOU CAN'T HAVE A JOB.  YOU CAN'T HAVE A JOB. GET OUT OF SOCIETY. IT'S SO OBVIOUS. ANYTHING NOT BASED ON PRINCIPAL REALLY DESERVES TO BE RIDICULED. WHEN IT'S -- WHEN THAT TOPIC IS PERP PERPETUATED, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO SERVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN A PROPAGANDA NARRATIVE THAT FEEDS SOMEONE'S AGENDA. BUT IF SOMETHING IS BASED ON PRINCIPAL, IT WILL USUALLY STAND STRONG WHEN IT'S HELD UP AGAINST RIDICULE.  Tucker: SINCE YOU'RE GETTING A BIG AUDIENCE AT THIS POINT, DOES IT AFFECT YOUR DAILY LIFE? DO YOU SHOW UP AT TRADER JOE'S AND PEOPLE ARE LIKE I KNOW YOU?  YEAH, YEAH, IT'S TYPICAL. I'LL BE STOPPED QUITE A BIT IN PUBLIC. NO MATTER HOW OFTEN I'M STOPPED, THERE'S NOTHING BUT GRATITUDE.

HERE'S A BEAUTIFUL PERSON MEANT TO AFFIRM YOU. SO I HAVE NOTHING BUT GRATITUDE FOR IT. IT'S ALSO A REALITY. IF TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE, I MIGHT HAVE TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT MOVEMENTS.  Tucker: DO YOU FIND YOURSELF BECOMING MORE ABSORBED IN YOUR FAITH AS YOU GET OLDER? OR IS THAT ALWAYS A BIG FEATURE OF YOUR LIFE?  MY FAITH HAS CHANGED. I USED TO BE HEY, TUCKER, I'M SPIRITUAL BUT NOT RELIGIOUS. NOW I'M ALL THOSE THINGS. THE PAST TWO YEARS, CHRISTIANITY HAS BECOME VERY APPEALING TO ME.  Tucker: WERE YOU NOTHING BUT GRATITUDE A CHRISTIAN PREVIOUSLY?  BY BIRTH, BAPTIZED CATHOLIC. SO NO LIKE I WOULDN'T CALL MYSELF A CHRISTIAN. NOW THE CHRISTIAN VALUES MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. ONE OF THOSE THINGS HAVE CHANGED THAT. I UNDERSTAND WHY COMMUNISTS DISCONNECT PEOPLE FROM GOD. WHEN I SEE --  Tucker: THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT THEY DO.  ABSOLUTELY. KILL THE PRIESTS. FIRST THING.  Tucker: WHEN I SEE THAT MOVEMENT HAPPEN IN OUR COUNTRY, WHAT THE TYRANTS WANT TO TAKE AWAY GETS MY ATTENTION. OH, THERE MUST REALLY BE SOMETHING THERE. AND THEN ALSO THE BIRTH OF MY CHILD. JUST WATCHING HIM BE BORN, IT WAS THE MOST RELIGIOUS SPIRITUAL GOD IS PRESENT HERE NOW LIFE MAKES SENSE, THIS IS GOD UNFOLDING HIMSELF IN TO HUMAN INCARNATION. SO WATCHING MY SON BE BORN WOKE UP SOMETHING NEW INSIDE OF ME. SO AND IT'S JUST WEIRD. THE MORE I SEE PEOPLE MOVING MORE AND MORE IN TO CHRISTIAN VALUES.  I SEE THAT EVERYWHERE. YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING?  I DO. THERE HASN'T BEEN SOME CONVENTION AROUND HEY, EVERYBODY, LIKE YOU'RE NEW TO CHRISTIANITY OR A FORMER LIBERAL. COME. NO, IT'S JUST THIS NATURAL MIGRATION OF THE HUMAN PSYCHE THAT SEEMS TO BE GOING TOWARDS CHRISTIAN VALUES.  Tucker: MIKE TYSON BECAME WORLD FAMOUS 40 YEARS AGO, MOVED TO PROBABLY THE GREATEST HEAVYWEIGHT BOXING CHAMPION OF ALL TIME. WE SAT DOWN WITH MIKE TYSON, WE DIDN'T TALK THAT MUCH ABOUT BOXING. HE TURNS OUT TO BE A GENUINELY DEEP AND INTERESTING PERSON. WE TALKED ABOUT HIS FAITH, ABOUT GOD. WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SLEEP FOR 14 YEARS BETWEEN TWO 400 POUND BENGAL TIGERS WHICH HE DID. THAT'S AHEAD. 20221227012536.866|20221227013047.310",

        "trs": " ARE YOU GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT? IT'S A KICKOFF PRIMARY IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. GIVES YOU A CERTAIN ADVANTAGE. YOU COULD MAKE A CREDIBLE CASE. WOULD YOU JOIN THE FREY? WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU DECIDE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER?  FIRST I HAVE TO SEE WHETHER MY APPLICATION TO BE THE CEO OF TWITTER COMES THROUGH. IF THAT'S DOESN'T COME THROUGH, ALL OPTIONS ARE ON THE TABLE. PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT IT. I GET IT. WE'RE HAVING CONVERSATION. MY FOCUS IS ON.  Charles: THAT WAS CHRIS SUNUNU TELLING NEIL CAVUTO ABOUT HIS PLANS FOR 2024. THIS WITH SOME NEW FOX POLL SHOWING A LOT OF VOTERS ARE NOT LIKING FORWARD TO A BIDEN TRUMP REMATCH. LET'S GO TO SARAH WESTWOOD. BOTH PARTIES HAVE SIMILAR BUT UNIQUE PROBLEMS HERE. RIGHT? WITH RESPECT TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP RUNS OR NOT, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, THERE'S STILL TRUMPIANISM IN THE ROOM. THE ONLY ONE SEEMS LIKE THAT THEY CAN CARRY THAT MANTEL OR THAT BATON IS GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?  TRUMP IN A LOT OF WAYS SHIFTED THE CENTER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I DON'T KNOW THAT GOVERNOR SUNUNU REPRESENTS WHERE THE ENERGY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WRITE DESANTIS IS SO POPULAR. SUNUNU REPRESENTS THE OLD GUARD, THE PRO BUSINESS, THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE ROAD KIND OF REPUBLICAN THAT HAS HELPED HIM BE SUCCESSFUL IN A BLUE STATE LIKE NEW HAMPSHIRE. BUT BROADLY SPEAKING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, DESANTIS HAS SHOWN A WAY TO WAGE THOSE CULTURE WAR FIGHTS IN EDUCATION, YOU KNOW, ON IMMIGRATION, ON A LOT OF ISSUES THAT REPUBLICANS CARE ABOUT IN A WAY THAT IS STILL NOT NEARLY AS DIVISIVE AS DONALD TRUMP. HE'S ABLE TO HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DEMOCRATS THAT DID NOT SUPPORT HIM THE FIRST TIME AROUND COME AROUND TO HIS SIDE WITH HIS LANDSLIDE ELECTION IN 2022. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF IDEOLOGY GET MATCHED UP. I'M NOT SURE THAT GOVERNOR SUNUNU REPRESENTS THE DIRECTION OF WHERE THE PARTY HAS BEEN GOING THE PAST EIGHT YEARS.  Charles: IF YOU GO BACK TO THE PRIOR ELECTION, HEADING INTO THE PRIMARIES, IT WAS ALL ABOUT THE YOUTH AND DIVERSITY AND HOW AMAZING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WAS. LOOK AT OUR CANDIDATES. WE HAVE HISPANICS, BLACKS, WOMEN. THE OLDEST WHY GUY IN THE WORLD WON. NOW EVERYONE IS SAYING IN THE PARTY POLITELY, YEAH, I'LL BACK PRESIDENT BIDEN. MANY OF THEM DIDN'T WANT TO HIM TO COME TO THEIR STATES. I THINK THERE'S SERIOUS ISSUES BUBBLING BEHIND THE SCENES THERE, SARAH.  THAT'S RIGHT. BIDEN WAS UNPOPULAR EVEN AMONG DEMOCRATS. HE DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH SUPPORT AS AN ENCUMBANT. PEOPLE VOTED ON ABORTION WHEN THEY CAST THEIR BALLOT'S. 2024 WILL BE A REFERENDUM ON JOE BIDEN'S PRESIDENCY. FINALLY VOTERS WILL HAVE TO REASSESS HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT JOE BIDEN. THAT'S WHY A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE SEEMS TO BE POSITIONING HIMSELF TO RUN AGAIN. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF WAYS TO DISTANCE THE PARTY, TO DISTANCE VULNERABLE CANDIDATES FROM BIDEN WHEN HIS NAME IS AT THE TOP OF THE BALLOT.  Charles: IF BIDEN DOES RUN, HE WON'T GET A LOT OF OPPOSITION. I HAVE A MINUTE TO GO. I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE REPUBLICANS. RON DESANTIS DIDN'T DECLARE ANYTHING WHEN HE RAN FOR GOVERNOR. THERE WOULD BE A DONNYBROOK IF AND PRESIDENT TRUMP ARE RUNNING. WHOEVER CAME OUT WOULD BE DAMAGED GOODS. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS THROWN HIS HAT IN THE RING. YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE THROWING HIM OFF PREMATURELY? I THINK SO.  I THINK WE WOULD ALL BE STUPID TO DO THAT AGAIN. IT HAPPENED IN 2016. THAT BEING SAID, HIS POPULARITY HAS DIMINISHED. THERE'S EVIDENCE FROM 2022 THAT HIS BRAND OF POLITICS IS NO LONGER POPULAR WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. DESANTIS HAS ALL THE MAKINGS OF SOMEONE THAT COULD KNOCK DROP OFF OF THE THRONE BECAUSE HAS HAS THE POPULARITY WITHOUT THE PACKAGE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT SO MANY REPUBLICANS WILL BE IN THERE THAT THE VOTE WOULD SPLIT.  Charles: AND HE MIGHT HAVE TO LIST WITH A NEW NICKNAME. NOT SURE WHAT IT WILL BE. MERRY CHRISTMAS. FOLKS, A SUPREME COURT SHOWDOWN IN THE NEW YEAR OVER PRESIDENT BIDEN'S STUDENT LOAN BAILOUT PLAN. BEFORE THE JUSTICES DECIDE IT, WE'LL DEBATE IT. SOMETHING FOR THE HOLIDAYS THAT MIGHT PUT YOU IN THE DOG HOUSE WITH YOUR INLAWS.  I'M RICH EDSON FROM FOX NEWS IN WASHINGTON. \"YOUR WORLD\" CONTINUES IN JUST A MOMENT. FIRST, THIS SPECIAL REPORT NEWS BREAK, A NEW BATCH OF TWITTER FILES HAS BEEN RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC TODAY. THE LATEST VOLUME FOCUSING ON HOW THE PLATFORM ALLEGEDLY RIGGED THE COVID DEBATE INCLUDING CLAIMS THAT BOTH THE BIDEN AND TRUMP ADMINISTRATIONS DIRECTLY PRESSED TWITTER EXECUTIVES TO MODERATE THE PLATFORMS PANDEMIC CONTENT ACCORDING TO THEIR WISHES. THE MASSIVE DEADLY WINTER STORM THAT HAS AFFECTED LARGE PORTIONS OF THE COUNTRY AND MOBILIZED MILLIONS IN NEW YORK HAS HAD PEOPLE PACK THEIR PATIENCE. THOUSANDS OF FLIGHT DELAYS ARE BEING REPORTED ON THIS DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS. CHINA HAS FLOWN MORE THAN 70 MILITARY AIRCRAFT NEAR TAIWAN. THE LARGEST INCURSION TO DATE. NOW BACK TO \"YOUR WORLD.\"  TAXPAYERS KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON THE SUPREME COURT AS THEY GET READY TO DECIDE THE FATE OF THE PRESIDENT'S STUDENT LOAN BAILOUT PROGRAM. ORAL ARGUMENTS ARE COMING IN EARLY IN 2023. WHICH SIDE WILL COME OUT ON TOP. LET'S DEBATE IT WITH JENNA ARNOLD AND INEZ. INEZ, LET'S START WITH THIS. IF IT WAS A POLITICAL PLOY, IT WORKED IN THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS. MAYBE THE WHITE HOUSE IS NOT AS CONCERNED ABOUT IT WINNING THIS COURT VICTORY AFTER ALL. YOUR THOUGHTS.  YEAH, IT CERTAINLY DID PROVIDE BIDEN AND HIS PARTY WITH A BOOST AMONG YOUNG VOTERS. SO I THINK HE REAPED THE POLITICAL BENEFITS OF THIS AND PROBABLY CARES LESS ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT OUTCOME AND ESPECIALLY ON THE MERITS OF THIS QUESTION. THIS IS ABOUT WHETHER THE PRESIDENT COULD HAVE THE EXECUTIVE ACTION. ALMOST EVERYBODY AGREED THEY COULD NOT INCLUDING LIBERAL LEGAL SCHOLARS AND NANCY PELOSI. THEY ALL AGREED IT COULDN'T BE DONE BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THE LAW TO DO THIS. THEY'RE RELYING ON 9-11 EMERGENCY POWER TO ADJUST THE TERMS OF FEDERAL LOANS. BUT OVERALL, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS PROBLEM AT SOME POINT REGARDLESS. SO EVEN IF THIS FORGIVENESS PLAN IS STRUCK DOWN AND I SUSPECT IT WILL BE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO DEBATE THE MERITS OF STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS. I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT. I DON'T THINK THIS PROBLEM IS GOING AWAY. WE HAVE 1.7 TRILLION IN OUTSTANDING DEBT.  THE IRONY, IF THEY WERE FORGIVEN, THE PROBLEM WOULD GET WORSE. JENNA, FIRST, YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE LEGAL ASPECT OF IT. HOW YOU HANDICAPPING THE SUPREME COURT?  I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE MUCH -- FIRST, HELLO AND HI, CHARLES. NICE TO SEE YOU. HOPE YOU HAD ARRESTFUL HOLIDAY. I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD BEYOND WHAT INEZ POINTED OUT AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS ARE POINTING OUT IN TERMS OF WHAT IT IS THAT BIDEN IS OR ISN'T ABLE TO DO HERE. TO ECHO INEZ'S POINT, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A HARD CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE TREAT THE MOST IMPORTANT NATIONAL ASSET THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY, WHICH IS HUMAN CAPITAL AND HOW WE VALUE HIGHER EDUCATION. I CONCUR WITH WHAT REPUBLICAN FOX HAS POINTED OUT FROM NORTH CAROLINA THAT THE FEE OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS GOING UNADDRESSED. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE A BIG STEP BACK AND SAY WHAT IS IT THAT THAT DIPLOMA IS OFFERING. I KNOW WHEN I HIRE FOLKS AND I CAN SPEAK TO A LOT OF OTHER FOLKS IN THE TECH INDUSTRY WHO ARE NOT INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT GPAs AND NOT INTERESTED IN SEEING THE NAME OR THE BRAND, THE LOGO AT THE TOP OF ANY RESUME, THE UNIVERSITY THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE ATTENDED. IN A WAY, THERE MIGHT BE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION TO BE PUT IN ITS PLACE NATURALLY BY A LOT OF OTHER CUSTOMERS, JUST NOT ATTENDING. WHAT ARE WE DOING WITH THAT TRILLION DOLLAR DEBT IS THE REAL QUESTION HERE.  Charles: IN ABOUT ANOTHER MONTH, AUTO DEBT WILL BE MORE THAN STUDENT LOAN DEBT. CREDIT CARD DEBT IS BACK OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS. THERE'S A LOT OF DEBT OUT THERE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WON'T MAKE THREE OR FOUR MILLION IN A LIFETIME. THE NOTION TO ASK THEM TO FORK OVER THEIR TAXPAYER MONEY FOR THOSE THAT WILL LIVE A BETTER LIFE AND THEIR CHILDREN WILL HAVE LESS HARSH REALITY THAN THEM IS THE ULTIMATE QUESTION OF FAIRNESS OR ELITISM IN THIS COUNTRY.  I AGREE. FANGLY THIS STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE A REGRESSIVE SORT OF POLICY. IF WE DID A FILL BAILOUT, EVERY STUDENT LOAN DEBT WAS GIVEN, THE WEALTHIEST, THE TOP 20% OF EARNERS IN THIS COUNTRY WOULD GET $7 FOR EVERY $1 THAT GOES TO TO BOTTOM. THE RICH DON'T NEED A BAILOUT. THE REASON THAT COUNTER INTUITIVE STATISTIC IS TRUE IS BECAUSE THE WEALTHY ARE THE ONES GETTING DEGREES. THE VERY TOP, 1%, ARE MOSTLY PAYING IN CASH. THEY'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT TAKING OUT STUDENT LOANS. THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS ARE THE ONES TAKING OUT THE LOANS. SO THIS ISN'T ALWAYS GOING TO BE A REGRESSIVE POLICY, ALWAYS GOING TO BE PEOPLE FROM THE LOWER HALF BAILING OUT TO TOP HALF. FRANKLY, IF WE'RE DISCUSSING A BAILOUT FOR THAT 1. 7 TRILLION OF LOAN DEBT THAT IS PROBLEM, WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT UNIVERSITIES. YALE IS A HEDGE FUND WITH A SCHOOL ATTACHED. THEY'VE BEEN SUBSIDIZED AND THEY SHOULD FIX IT.  Charles: JENNA, I HAVE 30 SECONDS IS. SOUNDS LIKE YOU AGREE ON A LOT OF ASPECTS OF THIS PROBLEM.  CERTAINLY AS IT APPLYING TO THE DOMINANCE OF THE IVIES. AND INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DOING A VERY EFFECTIVE JOB OF KEEPING WEALTH AND POWER WITHIN CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHICS IN THIS COUNTRY. I HAVE TO PUSH BACK THAT THE STUDENTS FORGIVENESS LOAN PROGRAM THAT BIDEN IS PROPOSING IS TARGETING MORE LOW INCOME FAMILIES. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT FAIRNESS HERE WHEN IT COMES TO WHO ACTUALLY GETS THE HELP WHEN AS A SOCIETY OUR MAJOR PRIORITY AND VIRTUE OF OURS IS EDUCATION. I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP THAT AT THE FOCUS OF OUR CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS AND NOT SORT OF SPLIT HAIRS AROUND THIS. LET'S GO AFTER ENDOWMENTS. INEZ LET ME KNOW WHEN THAT ZOOM CALL IS. I'LL BE THERE WITH YOU.  Charles: THANKS, LADIES. SOCIAL MEDIA APP TIK TOK IS ON THE CLOCK WITH CONCERNS ABOUT CHINA'S INFLUENCE GROWING. WHAT MORE AND MORE STATES ARE DOING. THINKING ABOUT YOUR NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION? FIND OUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT THINK THAT THEY'LL BE DROPPING THE BALL AFTER THIS BALL DROPS. 20221226213305.414|20221226213713.862",

        "trs": "SHANNON: CHRISTIANS ACROSS THE GLOBE ARE GATHERED FOR CHRISTMAS THIS WEEKEND AHEAD OF THE HOLIDAY WE TRAVELED TO NEW YORK CITY TO SIT DOWN WITH CARDINAL TIMOTHY DOLAN THE ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK, WE TALK ABOUT THE DIVISIONS IN OUR COUNTRY AND THE GROWING NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE STEPPING AWAY FROM FAITH IN THE MESSAGE HE'S HOPING THAT PEOPLE WILL ACTUALLY HEAR THIS TIME OF YEAR.  MERRY CHRISTMAS CARDINAL.  A BLESSING CHRISTMAS TO YOU IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU AND MY FRIENDS AT FOX.  IT IS A TREAT DURING ADVENT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IN THIS WORLD AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT IS A TIME OF TRYING TO QUIET DOWN A LITTLE BIT, ENJOY FAMILY AND FRIENDS, WHAT IS ADVENT MEAN TO YOU.  THAT IS PART OF IT I LIKE THE IDEA OF QUIETING DOWN, SILENCE IS WHY WE HAVE THE TRADITION OF MIDNIGHT MASS THAT'S A QUIETEST TIME OF THE EVENING SILENT NIGHT, HOLY NIGHT. SILENCE HAS A LOT TO DO WITH IT, WHAT MOTHER CHURCH INVITES US TO DO AND ADMIT IS ALSO PREPARE OUR SOULS OUR HEARTS, CHRISTMAS IS NOT ONLY A CELEBRATION OF THE BIRTH OF CHRIST OUR SAVIOR, IT IS ALSO THE FATHER'S INVITATION TO US TO LET HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON BE REBORN, REBORN WITHIN OUR HEARTS AND SOULS, IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, WHENEVER YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOMEBODY A VISITOR TO YOUR HOUSE YOU HAVE TO GET THE CLUTTER OUT OF THE WAY AND PREPARE A ROOM AND MAKE SURE THE GUESTROOM IS READY, LET'S MAKE SURE THE GUESTROOM OF HER HEART AND SOUL IS READY FOR THE GREATEST VISITOR OF ALL, THE CHRIST CHILD OUR SAVIOR. SHANNON: YOU VOTED PIECE FOR FOX THAT WAS SO INSIGHTFUL. ME AND MILLIONS OF OTHERS, YOU TALK ABOUT HOW SO MUCH OF WHAT WE THOUGHT IS WRONG IN OUR SOCIETY AND OUR DIVISIONS ARE HURTING EACH OTHER IN DISTRUSTING EACH OTHER AND ARE FIGHTING, IN PART BECAUSE YOU SAY WE ARE FORCING OUT WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE KEY.  I THINK SO, SOMEBODY'S GOT TO SAY THAT, IF I CAN'T SAY IT WHO CAN, WE HAVE FORGOTTEN GOD WE HAVE PUSHED GOD ASIDE WE OFTEN USE THE TERM SECULARISM, WHAT IS IT A LOT OF DIFFERENT ADMISSIONS. ONE OF THE TIGHTEST I'VE EVER HEARD IS SECULAR'S MEAN THAT HUMANITY DESIRE TO FORGET ABOUT GOD TO GET ALONG JUST FINE WITHOUT HIM, THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE CANNOT GET ALONG FINE WITHOUT HIM AND WE SEE THE MESS THAT WE GOT, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY WHY IS GOD ALLOWING ALL OF US AND I'M THINKING GOD DOESN'T WANT ALL THIS TO HAPPEN HE WANTS US TO ACCEPT HIM HIS MESSAGE AND HIS WAY OF LIFE IN HIS COMMANDMENTS. IF WE DO NOT USE A LOT LESS DIVISION. YOU THINKING VLADIMIR PUTIN WAS A BELIEVER AND TRUSTED IN GOD WHICH YOU CLAIMS TO BE HE WOULD'VE INVADED UKRAINE, I DOUBT IT. IF WE LET GOD TRIUMPH AND LET HIM BE LORD, WHAT IS THE LATIN WORD FOR LORD DOMINUS WHICH WE GET OUR WORD DOMINION, DOMINATE, WE LET HIM HAVE DOMINION WE LET HIM DOMINATE OUR LIVES THINGS ARE GOING TO GET A LOT BETTER ETERNAL HAPPINESS AND JOY CAN ONLY COME FROM THE LORD. NOT ONLY THE NEXT LIFE BUT ALSO IN THIS ONE A GREAT COMMENTATOR SAYS THE GLORY OF GOD IS THE HUMAN PERSON FULLY ALIVE. ANOTHER GREAT WRITER SAINT AUGUSTINE SAID GOD BECAME HUMAN SO HUMANS CAN BECOME DIVINE. THAT'S WHAT CHRISTMAS IS ABOUT. UNTIL WE ADMIT WE NEED GOD NOW ARE SAYING WE DON'T NEED GOD SOME PEOPLE SAY NICE IDEA I'M GLAD YOU'RE UP THERE FOR EVERY NEED YOU BUT PUT ME ON HOLD I'LL CALL YOU LATER. MOST PEOPLE ARE SAYING I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THERE IS A GOD AND IF HE DOES HE DOES HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT ME, IS THAT WHY WE ARE TROUBLE, AND YOU THINK KIDS IF THEY REALLY HAD FAITH WOULD SHOOT UP A SHOPPING CENTER OR CLASSROOM, I DON'T THINK SO. THERE IS A PROBLEM THERE, I DON'T KNOW WHY WE NEED A BILLY GRAHAM TO SAY THAT. SHANNON: PEOPLE LISTEN DID YOU TALK TO MILLIONS AROUND THE WORLD. LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE SAY 42% OF YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE NO RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION AND THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN THAT, GALLUP 2021 THEY HAVE THE LOWEST RECORDINGS SINCE I STARTED ASKING THE QUESTION 1944 DO YOU BELIEVE IN GOD, THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THAT I CAN BE A GOOD PERSON I DON'T NEED GOD ORGANIZED RELIGION SO WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?  YOU'RE ONTO SOMETHING YOU MADE THE PROPER DISTINCTIONS, MOST PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE IN GOD, THAT'S A GOOD THING ALTHOUGH IT'S DIMINISHING WHICH IS A BIT CHILLY, EVEN PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE IN GOD, THANKS BE TO GOD STILL THE MAJORITY WILL SAY I BELIEVE IN GOD BUT I DON'T REALLY NEED A RELIGION. SO IF YOU BELIEVE WITHOUT BEING UNITED WITH OTHER BELIEVERS THE BELIEF IS SOONER OR LATER GOING TO FADE IS GOING TO EVAPORATE BECAUSE IT'S TOUGH TO BELIEVE. SHANNON: THERE ARE THINGS IN SECULAR SOCIETY WERE HAVING THESE DEBATES WITHIN OUR COUNTRY WHERE WE FIND THE INTERSECTION OF THESE THINGS ABOUT MARRIAGE OR ABORTION AND THE RIGHTS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE CONNECTED TO THOSE ISSUES, DO YOU THINK WE CAN FIND A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BE MUTUAL RESPECT THERE COULD BE UNDERSTANDING FOR THE OTHER SIDE.  YES, WE CAN'T GIVE UP, FOR ONE WEEK AND LISTEN TO JESUS WHOSE BIRTHDAY WERE CELEBRATING WHO ALWAYS SAID HATE THE SIN BUT LOVE THE SINNER, EVEN IF THERE CERTAIN THINGS THAT PEOPLE DO THAT WE HAVE TO SAY I NEVER REALLY EXCEPT THAT AND I NEVER REALLY ENCOURAGE SOMEBODY TO THAT STYLE OF LIFE, I STILL LOVE THAT PERSON AND I WILL RESPECT AND I WILL LOVE THEM AND I WILL PROTECT THAT PERSON'S DIGNITY WITH MY OWN LOVE AND RESPECT. SHANNON: WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE THE HOLIDAYS ARE NOT A GOOD TIME FOR THEM THEY ARE STRUGGLING AND LOST SOMEONE THEY'VE LOST THE JOB AND BEEN THROUGH ROUGH COUPLE OF YEARS.  THEY REMEMBER YOU AND I SMILE WHEN WE THINK OF CHRISTMAS, A LOT OF PEOPLE TEARED UP THEY DIDN'T HAVE A HAPPY CHILDHOOD WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT. YOU'RE VERY RECOGNITION THAT SOMETHING IS MISSING IN YOUR LIFE YOU'RE VERY RECOGNITION THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOSS OF SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE MEANS WE NEED IT FILLED UP AND THAT'S WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL FEAST IS ALL ABOUT DON'T BE SAD, BE HAPPY. YOU'VE HEARD ME SAY BEFORE WE PUT THE CRIB UP NEXT DOOR AT STT THANKSGIVING IN THE FIRST YEAR I WAS HERE 14 YEARS AGO I SAID WHY DO WE PUT THE CRIB UP SO SOON, WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT IT UP RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND THE PASTOR SAID BECAUSE WE HAVE 3 MILLION PEOPLE COME THROUGH BUT HE SAID LOOK AT THE CRIB I SAID IS EMPTY AND HE SAID YES IT'S EMPTY WE DON'T PUT BABY JESUS THERE UNTIL CHRISTMAS AND PEOPLE AS THEY LOOK AT IT AUTOMATICALLY SAY THERE IS SOMEBODY MISSING AND THEY'LL SAY IT'S THE SON OF GOD, THAT'S THE MESSAGE SOMETHING IS MISSING IN LIFE. SHANNON: ARE YOU HOPEFUL WILL GET BACK TO A BETTER PLACE OF RESPECTING, LOVING EACH OTHER AND LESS FIGHTING AND LESS FIGHTING ON SOCIAL MEDIA AND WHATEVER THE PLATFORM IS, HOW DO WE GET THERE.  I'M IN THE BUSINESS OF HOPE OF FAITH AND RELIGION WITH THE CHURCH IS ALL ABOUT. I NEVER G GIVE UP I ALSO KNOW WE BUSINESS BEFORE THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN DIVISION IN THE WORST CAMPAIGN EVER, NO I TAKE YOU BACK IN THE ONES THAT WENT THROUGH IT THEY ALL SET AFTER EACH ONE. I'M VERY HOPEFUL YET AND REMAIN CONVINCED UNLESS THERE IS SOME RECOGNITION OF GOD AND EVEN THOSE WHO MAY NOT BE EXPLICITLY RELIGIOUS, EVEN IF THERE IS SOME RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS SOMETHING BEYOND US, THERE IS A TRANSCENDENT, THERE IS A BEYOND THAT GIVES ME PURPOSE AND MEANING AND THAT HELPS ME LIVE THE WAY THIS ULTIMATE POWER, YOU LOOK AT HER FRIENDS AT THE 12 STEP PROGRAM, THEY WILL CALL US THEY SAID WE DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL IT A HIGHER POWER IN THEY SAY THERE'S NO ATHEIST AND A FOX FILM, THEY SAY THERE'S NO ATHEIST AMONG MET FANS AND IN TIMES OF NEED AND CRISIS AND TENSION AND TRAUMA, I DON'T THINK I'M AN ATHEIST AND I GO THERE A LOT. IN TIMES OF CRISIS WITH TRAUMA, TENSION THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS IN LIFE I CAN'T HANDLE THAT I'M NOT IN CONTROL OF BUT I ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS, IT CAN BE A SENSE OF RECOVERY OF THE POWER AND BEYOND. AND BEYOND THIS THAT IS THE NAME FOR GOD AND IT BECAME INCARNATE IN A LITTLE BABY. OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST ON CHRISTMAS DAY IN BETHLEHEM. AND FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SAY OUR GOD IS SO TENDERLY ACCESSIBLE THAT HE WANTS US TO PICK HIM UP AND HOLD THEM AND KISS HIM AND HOLD HIM CLOSE AND LIKE A YOUNG COUPLE THE HITS OUR LIFE HAS PURPOSE FROM NOW ON EVERY WAKING MOMENT IS GOING TO BE FOR THIS LITTLE BABY FROM NOW ON MY LIFE IS NOT ABOUT ME IT'S ABOUT THIS BABY, IF WE CAN SAY THAT ABOUT THE SON OF GOD, YOU WATCH, WILL BE IN A BETTER SHAPE THIS TIME NEXT YEAR. SHANNON: M MERRY CHRISTMAS CARDINAL. SHANNON: UP NEXT ONE OF CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIAN MUSIC'S MOST RECOGNIZABLE NAMES, WE CATCH UP WITH MICHAEL W SMITH ON HIS CHRISTMAS TO HER.

        "trs": "TODD:  NOW TO A FOX WEATHER ALERT, THE HISTORIC WINTER STORM SLAMMING THE NORTHEAST YESTERDAY, DUMPING UPWARDS OF 28 INCHES OF SNOW IN BUFFALO. MANY AMERICANS FACING POWER OUTAGES AND TRAVEL CHAOS. AT LEAST 22 HAVE DIED AS A RESULT OF THE STORM. MAX GORDON IS LIVE IN HAMBURG, NEW YORK WITH THE LATEST. MAX.  REPORTER: GOOD MORNING, TODD AND MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU. THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE'S BUFFALO OFFICE REPORTING 43 INCHES AT BUFFALO AIRPORT. YOU CAN SEE IT PILED UP ALL AROUND US. EVEN THOUGH THERE'S MORE THAN THREE FEET OF SNOW ON THE GROUND, SOME AREAS SEE MORE BECAUSE OF THE DRIFTING. YOU CAN SEE THIS MASSIVE SNOW DRIFT RIGHT BEHIND ME. AS YOU MENTIONED, TENS OF THOUSANDS ARE WITHOUT POWER THIS CHRISTMAS. CREWS ARE OUT THERE, TRYING TO RESTORE YOU POWER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT OFFICIALS SAY SOME OF THE ISSUES THEY'RE ENCOUNTERING ARE  TREES KNOCKED INTO POWER LINES AND POWER STATIONS ARE ICED OVER. TRAVEL CONDITIONS ARE TREACHEROUS AND A TRAVEL BAN IS STILL IN EFFECT RIGHT NOW HERE IN ERIE COUNTY. SOME ROADS ARE IMPASSABLE FOR EVEN FIRST RESPONDERS. TWO PEOPLE UNFORTUNATELY DIED BECAUSE FIRST RESPONDERS WERE NOT ABLE TO GET TO THEM IN ERIE COUNTY AND ONE MAN WAS FOUND FROZEN TO DEATH IN BUFFALO. JUST TRAGIC SITUATIONS GOING ON THERE. BUT SOME GOOD NEWS, IT DOES APPEAR THE STORM IS BEGINNING TO LIFT A LITTLE BIT. WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME PEEKS OF BLUE SKY ALL AROUND US AND HOPEFULLY FOLKS WILL BE ABLE TO DIG OUT. THOUGH THERE IS SOME MORE SNOW EXPECTED, 1 TO 2 FEET OF ADDITIONAL SNOWFALL IS POSSIBLE OVER THE NEXT DAY WITH WINDS GUSTING OF UP TO 40 MILES PER HOUR. TODD, BACK TO YOU. TODD:  TIM IMAGES ARE REMARKABLE AND SCARY AT THE SAME TIME. MAX, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SENATOR RAND PAUL HIGHLIGHTING THE MOST WASTEFUL SPENDING OF THIS PAST YEAR INCLUDING 3 MILLION BUCKS WATCHING HAMPSTERS FIGHT ON STEROIDS AND MORE THAN 31 MILLION IN COVID RELIEF FUNDS SPENT ON LUXURY CARS. FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR LISA BOOTH JOINS US NOW. LISA, MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.   MERRY CHRISTMAS, MY FRIEND. TODD:  SO MANY RIDICULOUS EXAMPLES TO CHOOSE FROM. WHICH WAS THE MOST EGREGIOUS TO YOU?  YOU DON'T THINK MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO SEE A HAMPSTER FIGHT CLUB IS WORTHWHILE SPENDING FOR THE GOVERNMENT? YOU KNOW, IN REALITY, IT'S EASY TO LAUGH AT SOME OF THIS RIDICULOUS SPENDING. THANK GOD FOR SENATOR RAND PAUL. I DON'T THINK I REALLY APPRECIATED HIM AS MUCH AS I SHOULD HAVE UNTIL COVID AND WE REALIZED WHAT A PRINCIPLED MAN HE IS WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM IN THE SENATE. WHAT THIS COMES TO IS WE WORK HARD FOR OUR MONEY. THE PEOPLE AT HOME WATCHING WORK HARD FOR THEIR MONEY. THEN THE GOVERNMENT JUST STEALS IT, TAKES ITS FROM US AND LIGHTS IT ON FIRE AND KEEPS ASKING FOR MORE FOR THINGS THAT PEOPLE WATCHING RIGHT NOW SEE ON THEIR SCREEN. YOU KNOW, MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR A HAMPSTER FIGHT CLUB, OVER A MILLION TO GET HAMPSTERS, TO SEE THEM GET DRUNK AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN COVER THE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INTEREST PAYMENTS WE'RE PAYING ON ALL OF THIS DEBT SO IT'S A REALLY SAD REFLECTION OF WHERE WE ARE AS A COUNTRY AND WHAT LITTLE OUR GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY THINKS OF US. TODD:  TO THAT POINT, IF YOU WERE ONE OF THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS JUST TRYING TO AFFORD BASIC NECESSITIES, THANKS TO BIDEN INFLATION, AND YOU SEE THESE NUMBERS ON YOUR SCREEN, MONEY SO THAT PARROTS CAN MATE, WHAT ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO THINK?  I THINK IT BREEDS FRUSTRATION AND A ANGER TOWARDS OUR GOVERNMENT AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE WITH COVID, FOR EXAMPLE, RIGHT, THE GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN THE ECONOMY OVER A VIRUS FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS, AS DEADLY AS THE FLU, THEN SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO PAY PEOPLE TO STAY HOME AND CHANGE THE WORK CULTURE IN OUR NATION AND SPENT TRILLIONS MORE ON A SO-CALLED INFLATION REDUCTION ACT AND THE MEDIA LIED TO US, TOLD US IT WOULD HELP INFLATION AND EVERYONE SAID LOL, JUST KIDDING, IT'S A CLIMATE BILL. WE'RE GOING TO SADDLE YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN WITH MORE DEBT. I THINK WE'RE ALL REALIZING THAT OUR GOVERNMENT DOESN'T CARE ABOUT US AND IT'S TRULY BROKEN AND WE NEED MORE PEOPLE LIKE SENATOR RAND PAUL AND MORE PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT US AND ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT IS DOING TO THE COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. TODD:  I THINK A BIGGER QUESTION IS WHY. YOU KNOW THE SWAMP PRETTY WELL. YOU KNOW THE PLAYERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. I MIGHT ADD. WHY DO THEY THINK THIS IS ACCEPTABLE, WASTING OUR TAX DOLLARS LIKE THIS. AGAIN, BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE.   WELL, I THINK IT'S TWO-FOLD. ONE, IT'S TO BUY VOTES. WE SAW WHAT JOE BIDEN DID AHEAD OF THE -- AHEAD OF THE MIDTERM ELECTION WITH THE STUDENT LOAN BAILOUT WHICH ENDED UP BEING UNCONSTITUTIONAL BUT HE DID IT TO BUY VOTES AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE AND LOOK HOW WELL DEMOCRATS DID AMONG GEN Z GENERATION SO I THINK PART OF IT'S TO BUY VOTES. THE MORE SINISTER AND SAD PART OF IT I BELIEVE IS TO HE CREATE GOVERNMENT DEPENDENCY. I THINK IF YOU'RE BEING GIVEN MONEY -- IF YOU'RE BEING GIVEN MONEY TO STAY HOME, TO NOT WORK, ARE YOU MORE INDEPENDENT OF THE GOVERNMENT OR DEPENDENT ON THE GOVERNMENT AND THEN THEY OWN YOU AND SO I THINK THAT'S THE MORE SINISTER AND PROBABLY THE BROADER INTENT IS TO CREATE MORE DEPENDENCY TO GIVE PEOPLE IN CHARGE MORE CONTROL AND POWER. TODD:  IT BENEFITS THE DEMOCRATS WHO HAVE BEEN EXPERTS AT THAT SINCE DEMOCRATS STARTED THEIR PARTY. WE DO STORIES LIKES THIS EVERY YEAR, LISA. IS IT EVER GOING TO STOP? NEXT YEAR WILL WE NOT DO THIS STORY BECAUSE MAGICALLY THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO STOP WASTING YOUR MONEY?  I DON'T THINK SO, TODD. THAT'S THE SAD REALITY. I THINK MORE AMERICANS ARE WAKING UP. I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT COVID FOR A LOT OF US IGNITED A FIRE IN US AND REALIZING HOW DAMAGED OUR GOVERNMENT IS, OUR GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY WORKING AGAINST US. THEY SAID IT WAS IN THE NAME OF COVID. IT WASN'T. IT WAS THE POLITICIANS SHUTTING DOWN THE ECONOMY, DESTROYING JOBS, THE LIVELIHOODS AND LIVES OF SO MANY AMERICAN. > I THINK PEOPLE ARE WAKING UP TO ALL OF THIS AND SO WHAT IS INCUMBENT UPON US IS TO CHOOSE LEADERS, PICK PEOPLE LIKE THE SENATOR RAND WALL PAULS OF THE -- RAND PAULS OF THE YEAR. I'M A FLORIDIAN. MORE GOVERNORS LIKE RON DE SANTIS AND PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY CARE AND PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT TO BE IN GOVERNMENT. I WANT PEOPLE IN CONGRESS OR WHO ARE GOVERNORS WHO HATE GOVERNMENT. WHO ARE RELUCTANT LEADERS AND THEY'RE JUST DOING IT BECAUSE THEY WANT TO CHANGE THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY. TODD:  GET IN THERE, DO YOUR JOB, GET OUT. DON'T MAKE IT A CAREER. AND DON'T FORCE HAMPSTERS TO FIGHT ON THE GOVERNMENT DOLLAR. GOSH, GOODNESS --  IT'S MEAN. TODD:  THAT'S A PRIVATE FUNCTION. THAT'S FOR LISA BOOTH AND I TO DO IN OUR PRIVATE TIME. MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU.   I DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN YOUR HOUSE FOR CHRISTMAS. TODD:  IT'S A PARTY. GETS WILD. MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.   YOU'RE THE BEST. TAKE CARE.

        "trs": "CARLEY:  LISTEN TO THIS SITUATION. BRITISH POLICE ARRESTED A WOMAN AFTER SHE WAS SILENTLY PRAYING NEAR AN ABORING ABORTION CLINIC. SHE JOINED TUCKER CARLSON TO SOUND OFF.   I WAS ARRESTED. I WAS SEARCHED. I WAS LOCKED IN A CELL. I WAS THEN INTERVIEWED OR INTERROGATED, HOWEVER YOU LIKE TO SEE IT. DURING WHICH I WAS QUIZZED ABOUT WHAT I WAS PRAYING ABOUT. CARLEY:  HERE TO REACT, EVANGELIST AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR, ALVEDA KING. SHE WAS SILENTLY PRAYING AND GOT ARRESTED.   GOOD MORNING, CARLEY. MERRY CHRIS CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE. YES, THAT TOUCHED MY HEART. THE LADY HAD ON HER HEART SO MUCH TO PRAY OUTSIDE THE CLINIC, PROBABLY FOR THE WOMEN GOING IN, THE FAMILIES IMPACTED, THE BABIES. SHE WAS SILENCED. SHE WAS NOT DISRUPTED. I WATCHED VERY CAREFULLY. I BELIEVE ESPECIALLY DURING THIS TIME OF YEAR THERE SHOULD BE A SPIRIT OF UNDERSTANDING AND GENEROSITY. SO I THOUGHT THAT WAS A VERY UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT AND I KNOW SHE HAD TO BE TRAUMATIZED SO MY PRAYERS GO OUT TO HER AND LET'S JUST REMEMBER NOW ALL YEAR, NOT JUST AT CHRISTMAS, BUT ALL YEAR WE SHOULD HAVE GENEROSITY AND COMPASSION AS HUMAN BEINGS SO THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT WHEN I WATCHED THAT. CARLEY:  ABSOLUTELY. THERE'S POLLING THAT SHOWS THAT THE FURTHER WE GET ON INTO THE YEARS, THERE IS A LACK OF HE RELIGION, NOT JUST IN THIS COUNTRY BUT AROUND THE WORLD. WHY ARE WE SEPARATING OURSELVES FROM GOD?  INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, AND THERE AGAIN I SAY CHRISTMAS SEASON, OF COURSE WE-MANY OF US KNOW THAT JESUS WAS BORN IN THE SPRING, NOT IN DECEMBER AND CERTAINLY ALL THE ARGUMENTS OVER MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY HOLIDAYS, I ALWAYS SAY HAPPY HOLIDAYS, MERRY CHRISTMAS, HAPPY KWANZAA, HAPPY HANUKKAH, JUST HAPPY, ALL, LET'S BE BLESSED PERIOD. IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO THAT. WITH THE NATIVITY SCENE I PUT CHARACTERS WHO ARE BROWNER THIS YEAR. SOME PEOPLE COMMENTED. WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR ART WORK. I THOUGHT HE WAS LATINO. I SAID HE'S FOR ALL OF US. JOHN 316 SAYS THAT. SO DURING THIS SEASON, AND ALL YEAR, AND SPIRITUAL ITY SHOULD E IN OUR HEARTS, GENEROSITY SHOULD BE IN OUR HEARTS YEAR-ROUND, CARLEY, SHOULDN'T BE JUST A TIME IN ONE LITTLE SEASON. CARLEY:  THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THAT'S SUCH A BEAUTIFUL MESSAGE. IS THAT YOUR CHRISTMAS MESSAGE FOR US THIS MORNING? IT'S CERTAINLY ENOUGH. OR DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER ONE YOU WOULD TRY TO SHARE?  TRY FIND SOME JOY. WE LOST SOMEONE SPECIAL TO US DURING THIS WEEK AND I LOST SOMEONE SPECIAL TO ME DURING COVID. OUR HEARTS OUR BROKEN. SHARE JOY, KINDNESS, PEACE, LOVE, THIS SEASON AND ALL YEAR. CARLEY:  AND A LITTLE BIT OF FUN AS WELL. WE GET THAT IN THE FORM OF THE LATEST EDITION OF ALVEDA KING'S HOUSE. IT'S ON FOX NATION, THE NEW EPISODE IS OUT THURSDAY, DECEMBER 29th. THANKFULLY, WE HAVE A SNEAK PEEK. WATCH THIS.   CHURCH COMMUNITY, VARIOUS COMMUNITIES, THEY HAVE BUILT INTO THEM A SYSTEM THAT HELPS REVIVE THOSE WHO ARE DOWN, REVIVE THOSE WHO ARE IN A TOUGH SITUATION SO THAT'S WHAT GOT US THROUGH SOME VERY DIFFICULT TIMES TOGETHER.   SO WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION, AN OPPORTUNITY, A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE THAT COMMUNITY. CARLEY:  ALVEDA, TELL US ABOUT THE UPCOMING EPISODE, YOU AND TWO OF YOUR GIRLFRIENDS.   WELL, MY BUCKET LIST, I'M 72 YEARS OLD, I WANT TO GO TO TUSCANY. I SAID LET'S WRAP UP THIS YEAR AND THIS SEASON IN TUSCANY.

        "trs": "PAUL: A TOP WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR ARGUING THE DEMOCRATIC MIDTERM PERFORMANCE GAVE HIM A JOLT OF MOMENTUM INTO THE SECOND HALF OF HIS TERM FOR THIS CALL SHOWS THE PRESIDENT'S JOB APPROVAL RATING IS STILL IN THE MID- FORTIES AND DOWN FROM THIS TIME LAST YEAR THE VOTERS ARE GIVING HIM LOW MARKS THE HANDLING OF ECONOMY IMMIGRATION AND ENERGY POLICY SO THERE IS TALK ABOUT POLITICAL COME BACK. WALL STREET JOURNAL COLUMNIST AND CONTRIBUTOR KARL ROVE SENIOR ADVISOR TO GEORGE W. BUSH. GOOD TO SEE YOU SAW THIS LAST YEAR WHAT IS THE LESSON THEY SHOULD LEARN FROM THIS?  DON'T NOMINATE KNUCKLEHEADS. TO HAVE A BACKGROUND DIRECT TO THE PEOPLE'S VISION AND VALUES THAT PEOPLE CAN AGREE WITH YOU AND IF YOU DON'T DO THAT THEN YOU WILL LOSE SPENT HOW BIG OF A FACTOR IN RESPECT THEY HAVE TO GET AHEAD OF THAT QUICK.  .  TO HAVE A REFERENDUM ON THE BALLOT BUT THINK ABOUT THIS WE HAD PRO-LIFE GOVERNORS GEORGIA AND TEXAS BY THOSE ELECTION MARGINS AND IF ABORTION WOULD HAVE UNIFORMLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ACROSS THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE SEEN IT THERE. REPUBLICANS HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IN A WAY THAT APPEALS TO SUBURBAN VOTERS WHO MAY SWING AGAINST THEM IN THERE IS A CONSENSUS IN THE COUNTRY IF WE WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT OR NOT. PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BE ABOLISHED TWO THIRDS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANTED TO OVERTURN ROE V WADE BUT YET ON THE OTHER HAND MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND 75 PERCENT IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER SO LIMITATIONS ON ABORTION WITH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE AND INCEST AND THAT'S WHAT WORD LARGELY SUPPORT THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE NATION. PAUL: A GREAT BITING COME BACK.  I FEEL IT. AND GIVING A JOLT OF MOMENTUM REAL CLEAR POLITICS HAVE REACHING THE JOB APPROVAL BRING IT 43.4 PERCENT THIS MORNING A ONE.3 PERCENT INCREASE I FEEL IT EVERY MOMENT OF THE DAY.  SO LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE THE ELECTION THE DEMOCRATS WERE MUMBLING THIS IS WHY HE CAN'T RUN WE WILL LOSE AND THEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM BOWS OUT HE WON'T RUN AGAINST BIDEN AND BIDEN IN THE WHITE HOUSE TALKING ABOUT THEY WILL ANNOUNCE IT IN THE NEW YEAR SO DOES NOT SALVAGE HIS PRESIDENCY?  IT SCARED OFF SOME EARLY CONTENDERS BUT I HAVE TO GIVE COMPLIMENTS THIS IS BEAUTIFULLY DONE. STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE AGENDA HAS BROUGHT HIM SUPPORT. REMEMBER OHIO STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE AGENDA AMEND MIKE THE WINE GOT REELECTED AS REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR BY 26 POINTS AND SWEPT THE ENTIRE TAKE IT WITH HIM. THAT ONE SWING STATE OF FLORIDA THE REPUBLICANS CRUSH THE DEMOCRATS IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS 600,000 PEOPLE HAVE REGISTERED IN FLORIDA AS REPUBLICAN AND 27000 MORRIS DEMOCRATS. GEORGIA ONE BY ONE TENS OF 3 PERCENT BUT THEN THE GOVERNOR TAKES THE ENTIRE TAKE IT THE ONLY STATEWIDE CANDIDATE TO LOSE WAS HERSCHEL WALKER HE WAS PART OF THAT KNUCKLEHEAD GROUP WISCONSIN. YOUR STATE THERE WAS A US SENATOR RUNNING AGAINST EVERY SINGLE THING JOE BIDEN EVER PROPOSED INCLUDING WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK IT IS AND RON JOHNSON RAN FOR REELECTION NEW YORK FULL REPUBLICAN NEW CONGRESSMAN IN A BLUE STATE WHERE WAS THAT SUPPORT FOR THE AGENDA? ARIZONA ONE BY THREE TENTHS OF 1 PERCENT AND THE DEVON SENATE CANDIDATE LEFT THE CLOSING MASSIVE MESSAGE OF HIS CAMPAIGN HIS OPPOSITION TO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION POLICY ON THE BORDER IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN IF ONLY BARELY TETHERED IN THE FACTS AND THE REALITY.  YOU WERE PREDICTING 20 SOME SEATS IN THE HOUSE WITH A NARROW MAJORITY WILL BE TO 22 AND WILL MAKE IT HARD TO GOVERN WITH A VERY LEFT-WING CANDIDATE IN PENNSYLVANIA. IF I WERE THE WHITE HOUSE I WOULD BE TALKING UP THAT BOOK ALSO.  THAT I WOULDN'T PUT THE CREDIT BEHIND JOE BIDEN AGENDA. THINK ABOUT IT THERE ARE AT LEAST 11 CANDIDATES DEEPLY FIVE JOHN GIBBS IN MICHIGAN WHO WERE TRUMP ENDORSED AND HAD FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS AND LOST VERY NARROWLY THE REPUBLICANS OF THEY NOMINATED SLIGHTLY BETTER CANDIDATES WOULD HAVE MORE PICKUPS AND THE SAME IN THE SENATE EVEN FIVE CANDIDATES WE CAME CLOSE BUT WHAT SURPRISED ME ABOUT THIS ELECTION WAS HOW MUCH THE RETURN OF THE TICKETS HAVE BEEN WE HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO SAID I'M GOING FOR BRIAN CAN FOR GOVERNOR BUT NOT HERSCHEL WALKER FOR THE SENATE AND THAT IS ALMOST ONE OUT OF EVERY NINE VOTERS IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA AND ALSO HAPPENED IN ARIZONA AND AROUND THE COUNTRY.  THANK YOU AND MERRY CHRI CHRISTMAS.  I THOUGHT YOU WOULD WEAR A RED TIE SO I WORE THE GREEN ONE. MERRY CHRISTMAS.  WHEN WE COME BACK HOUSE DEMOCRATS MAKE A FINAL PUSH AGAINST DONALD TRUMP IS A PREPARE FOR LIFE IN THE MINORITY LOOKING AT THE RAISING POLITICAL PERIL FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT AS HE MAKES ANOTHER WHITE HOUSE RUN ON THE ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE EMERGING INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. 20221224201816.443|20221224202111.801",

        "trs": "PAUL: NO MENTIS YEAR FOR THE SUPREME COURT THE JUSTICES VOTING TO OVERTURN ROE V WADE SENDING THE ISSUE OF ABORTION BACK TO THE STATES. THAT DECISION AND OTHERS ON GUN RIGHTS AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY HELPED TO FUEL AN UNPRECEDENTED ATTACK ON THE COURT WHEN THE LEGITIMACY WITH PROGRESSES TAKING AIM AT THE REPUBLICAN APPOINTED JUSTICES. BRINGING BACK OUR PANEL, LOOKING AT THE DOBBS DECISION OVERTURNING ROE V WADE OF COURSE THAT WAS PREDICTED OF SUPPORTERS OF ABORTION RIGHTS THAT WOULD BE A CATASTROPHE BUT REALLY IT HAS NOT TURNED OUT THAT WAY.  EVEN BEFORE THE COURT DECIDED THEY WERE MOVING TO LEGALIZE ABORTION AND THAT EVOLUTION WOULD HAVE NOT HAVE THE COURT STEPPED IN. AND THEN TO STOP ALL OF THIS AND THEN GOING BACK TO THE STATES AND SINCE THAT TIME THE PUBLIC VIEW OF ABORTION HAS CHANGED AND IT WAS IN A MUCH HEALTHIER AND MORE DEMOCRATIC WAY AND THAT IS MUCH MORE THAN REPUBLICANS SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE OTHER DECISIONS BY THE COURT A COUPLE OF BIG ONES ON REGULATORY POLICY TAKING ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE THE MAJOR QUESTIONS DOCTRINE THAT DOESN'T GET AS MUCH ATTENTION AS IT DESERVES AS IT ECHOES THROUGHOUT THE COMING YEARS.  SO THAT IF CONGRESS IS GIVING AUTHORITY TO A REGULATORY AGENCY CONGRESS DOESN'T HIDE ALL THINGS AND NOW SCHOOLS AS JUSTICE SCALIA PUT IN AN OPINION. SO THE COURT HAS BEEN AND THEN ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IS THE CDC EVICTION MORATORIUM AND THEN IF CONGRESS GIVES PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITY. AND DOES THAT EXTEND TO BANNING EVICTIONS NATIONWIDE AND THE SUPREME COURT SAID NO. AND THERE ARE LOTS OF CASES IN THE COMING YEARS AS THE SUPREME COURT FIGURES OUT HOW FAR THE REGULATORY AGENCIES CAN GO.  AND THIS WILL BE DECIDED NEXT YEAR ON RACIAL PREFERENCES IN EDUCATION.  AND THEN TO TACKLE SOME OF ISSUES IN THE COURT HAS GONE ASTRAY.  WHAT I FIND SO FINE LINE \u2014- IS INTERESTING IS THE MAIN EMPHASIS IT SEEMS TO BE CHECK THE POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO BE INVOLVED IN YOUR LIFE PUT ASIDE ABORTION BECAUSE YOU CAN DEFENDED ON THOSE GROUNDS BUT ALMOST EVERYTHING THEY DO SAYS WAIT A MINUTE MINORITIES AND PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE MINORITY HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS AND WE DEFEND THOSE RIGHTS AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT JUST WAVE IT'S TIME AND DICTATE THE LIFE OF PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AND THAT SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED AS A LIBERAL IN THE CLASSICAL SENSE AND INSTEAD IT IS VIEWED AS ANTI- LIBERAL BY THE MEDIA.  THE COURT DOESN'T ALWAYS DECIDE THINGS AS I CAN TELL ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS IT SUPPORTED BIDEN AND THAT REMAIN IN MEXICO POLICY AND AND CONGRESS HAS THE RIGHT TO SEE DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS BUT THE ATTACKS ON THE LEFT OF THE LEGITIMACY HAVE REALLY PICKED UP GOING AFTER INDIVIDUAL JUSTICES SO HOW DO YOU THINK EFFECTIVE THAT CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN QUICK.  NOT AT ALL IS A STANDARD LEFT-WING TECHNIQUE MARCHING IN FRONT OF THE JUSTICES AND THEN TO BRING THE ARGUMENT THEY CANNOT POLICE THEIR OWN ETHICS AND ON JUSTICE ALITO. THE LEFT TRIES TO DECLARE CERTAIN IDEAS AS OUTSIDE ACCEPTABLE DISCUSSION IN THE UNITED STATES. 303 CREATIVE OF THE COLORADO WEBSITE OWNER WHO DID NOT FOR RELIGIOUS REGION ON \u2014- REASONS WANT TO CONDUCT WEBSITES FOR THINGS LIKE MARRIAGES. AND FREE SPEECH AND WHAT CAN PEOPLE SAY AND NOT SAY? IN THAT CASE WE GET AT LEAST FIVE JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COURT AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES. ON THE LEFT TRYING TO SILENCE PEOPLE THAT DON'T AGREE WITH THEM.  THE HITS AND MISSES OF THE.. YEAR.. PAUL: IT'S TIME FOR THE HITS AND MISSES OF THE YEAR STARTING WITH DONENESS.  MY MISS IS TO THE BIDEN BORDER EVEN BEFORE BIDEN TOOK OFFICE HE WAS BROADCASTING HE WOULD TAKE ANY ASYLUM-SEEKERS WHO CAME TO THE COUNTRY AND THEN TO DISMANTLE ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW BORDER OF ENFORCEMENT. WITH TITLE 42. AND THEN THOSE COMING TO THE BORDER AND IT IS DEEPLY UNDERMINING THE POTENTIAL FOR THE IMMIGRATION DEAL AND CREATING A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS.  I WILL GIVE THE THIS TO ME HER IMAGE CONSPIRACY THEORIES OF VOTING ON THE RIGHT IT IS MASS FRAUD FAILING TO APPEAR DESPITE THE BACKING THEY WERE REJECTED AT THE BALLOT BOX IT IS MASSIVE VOTER SUPPRESSION WHICH FAILED TO APPEAR IN DESPITE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S WARNING GOING INTO JIM CROW TWO.ZERO TURNOUT WAS HIGH BEATING HERSCHEL WALKER NOT ONCE BUT TWICE SO NO ELECTION IS EVER PERFECT IN THEIR WAYS TO IMPROVE THE GENERALLY RUN BY LOCAL OFFICIALS AND IT SEEMED TO WORK IN 2022.  THOSE THAT EXPERIENCE ANOTHER YEAR OF RUNAWAY VIOLENT CRIMES IN 2022 BETWEEN DEFINED THE POLICE AND HATRED FOR THE POL POLICE, IT IS ANOTHER 12 MONTHS OF HELL FOR URBAN AMERICA AND MOST OF THE VICTIMS OF THIS CRIME ARE IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES, THEY LIVE AND WORK THERE AND THEY HAVE BEEN THE HARDEST HIT SO A CHAIR FOR NEW YORK GOVERNOR.  IT GOES TO THE NATION PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER UNIONS WHO ASSISTED ME IN THE PANDEMIC KEEPING SCHOOLS CLOSED OR ON A MODIFIED SCHEDULE. SO THE NATION'S REPORT CARD HAVE REVEALED THE COST FOR STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT IS EXTRAORDINARY AMONG THOSE EIGHTH-GRADERS THE MATH SCORES DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY THEY WILL PAY PRICELINE INTO THEIR ADULT LIFE SO NEVER CLOSE THE SCHOOLS AG AGAIN.  GOING TO PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR THE STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS DECISION THAT COULD COST $400 BILLION GROSSLY UNFAIR TO THOSE WHO DID NOT GO TO COLLEGE OR DID REPAY THEIR LOANS HE HAD NO AUTHORITY FROM CONGRESS TO DO AND BASED ON NOTHING BUT HIS PERSONAL WHEN AND THE SUPREME COURT NEXT YEAR WHEN HE HEARS THIS CASE WILL DECLARE IT ILLEGAL AS THE JUSTICES SHOULD WHEN WERE BREAK WHEN WE COME BACK TO HIT FOR THE YEAR. PAUL: TIME NOW FOR OUR HITS OF THE YEAR AND, KIM, FIRST TO YOU.  SO, PAUL, MY HIT GOES TO THE EXEMPLARY LIFE AND REIGN OF QUEEN ELIZABETH II. WORLD LOST HER THIS YEAR AT AGE 96 AFTER 70 AMAZING YEARS ON THE THRONE. SHE WAS THE EMBODIMENT OF DUTY, SHE WAS A SYMBOL OF MARTIAL UNITY EVEN -- NATIONAL UNITY EVEN WHEN HER COUNTRY WAS GOING THROUGH TRYING TIMES. SHE WAS BELOVED AROUND THE GLOBE. AND AS POLITICIANS LOOK FORWARD TO COME UP WITH SOME NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS, THEY COULD DO WORSE THAN TO SIMPLY TRY TO MIRROR SOME OF QUEEN ELIZABETH'S SHEER CLASS. WE COULD ALL USE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT, MAY SHE REST IN PEACE. PAUL: KYLE.  I'LL GIVE A HIT TO NASA'S DARK MISSION, THE DOUBLE IT'S RIDE REDIRECTION TEST, AND -- IT'S -- ASTEROID PRO, A SPACECRAFT THE SIZE OF A REFRIGERATOR BUT MOVING AT 14,000 MILES AN HOUR. AND THE POINT WAS TO SEE HOW MUCH THE ASTEROID'S ORBIT WOULD BE AFFECTED. SCIENTISTS SAY THE ANSWER IS MUCH MORE THAN THEY THOUGHT, BUT NOW IS THE TIME TO TEST THIS TECHNOLOGY. AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THERE IS NO HUGE ASTEROID HURTLING TOWARD EARTH AT MOMENT, BUT THAT IS PROBABLY JUST WHAT THE DINOSAURS THOUGHT, AND WE KNOW HOW THAT ENDED UP. [LAUGHTER] PAUL: MARY.  A HIT FOR THE ARGENTINE FOOTBALL CLUB WHICH BROUGHT HOME THE WORLD CUP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 36 YEARS. THE REST OF SPANISH-SPEAKING AMERICA DOESN'T ALWAYS LOVE ARGENTINA, BUT THEY UNITED BEHIND THE TEAM I THINK LARGELY BECAUSE OF LIONEL MESSI, THE TEAM CAPTAIN, WHO SHOWED A LOT OF SKILL PLAYING ON THE FIELD IN CHARACTER AND LEADERSHIP IN LIFE. PAUL: DAN.  THE HIT OF THE YEAR GOES TO UKRAINE, SPECIFICALLY THE MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN OF UKRAINE. NOBODY BUT THEM EXPECTED THEM TO BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND AN ONSLAUGHT FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN'S MILITARY MIGHT. WELL, THEY HAVE DONE SO WITH EXTRAORDINARY COURAGE, ARE RESILIENCE AND NOT LEAST SMART MILITARY TACTICS HAVE BEEN A MARVEL TO BEHOLD. UKRAINIANS ARE FIGHTING THE AUTHOR TALK ABOUT THREAT FOR ALL OF -- THREAT FOR ALL OF -- AUTHORITARIAN THREAT FOR ALL OF US. PAUL: AN ADVANCE -- AND ADVANCED MILITARY WEAPONS AS SOON AS WE CAN GET THEM THERE. ALL RIGHT, MY HIT OF THE YEAR IS TO THE DEVELOPMENTS OF BIOMEDICINE, FANTASTIC DISCOVERIES THAT WE DON'T READ ENOUGH ABOUT ARE HAPPENING ALL THE TIME. A NEW POTENTIAL VACCINE FOR MELANOMA WITH MRNA TECHNOLOGY THE, NEW TREATMENT, POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR ALZHEIMER' PRECISION ONCOLOGY. DEVELOPMENTS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND GENETICS ARE MAKING ALL KINDS OF THINGS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEDAY COULD SAVE YOUR LIFE. WE LIVE IN A GREAT AGE OF BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION. AND REMEMBER, IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN HIT OR MISS, BE SURE TO BETWEEN IT TO US END|20221224205954|2022-12-24_2000_US_FOX-News_The_Journal_Editorial_Report ",

REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN NANCY MACE TURNING THE TABLES ON HARVARD PROFESSOR AND LEFT-WING ACTIVISTS DURING HOUSE HEARING ON FREDERICK. AND ALL THEY HAD TO DO WAS CHECK TWITTER.  ONLY A FEW WEEKS AFTER ATTEMPTED ATTACK ON SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ON JUNE 25TH 1 OF THE WITNESSES TWEETED OUT THE FOLLOWING RESPONSE ON ABORTION. THE SIX JUSTICES WHO OVERTURNED ROE SHOULD NEVER KNOW PEACE AGAIN. IT IS OUR SPECIFIC DUTY TO ACCOST THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE IN PUBLIC. THEY ARE PARIAHS. SINCE WOMEN DON'T HAVE THEIR RIGHTS, THE JUSTICES SHOULD NEVER HAVE A PEACEFUL MOMENT IN PUBLIC AGAIN. DO YOU BELIEVE RHETORIC IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY?  I DON'T THINK IT IS A PAIR CHARACTERISTIC.  DID YOU NOT TWEET THAT THAT YOU THOUGHT THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SHOULD BE ACCOSTED?  WHAT I AM SAYING IS THAT IT IS NOT A CHARACTERIZATION OF MY STATEMENT. SPEED TO DEAN I DO HAVE GOOD ADVICE THEM I ADVICE ABOUT TWITTER.  Dana: I HAVE ADVICE FOR STAFFERS WHO WORK FOR A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS PEOPLE PUTTING TOGETHER HEARINGS. CHECK THE TWITTER FEEDS OF WITNESSES THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE PEER THAT IS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I THOUGHT, WHAT GENIUS ON THE COMMITTEE THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO HAVE HER THERE? THE REASON THEY DON'T CHECK IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T THINK THEY WILL GET CALLED OUT ON IT. THE LEFT IS BEING HARMED BY TWITTER NOT BECAUSE OF ELON MUSK BUT BECAUSE THEY THINK IT IS A SAFE HARBOR FOR THEM THAT NOBODY IS GOING TO GO AFTER THEM AND LIKE THE SAFE PLACE FOR THEM. I THINK THAT NANCY MACE'S TEAM ALL SHE HAD TO DO WAS HAVE HER TEAM -- DID YOU SEE THIS, CHECK THIS OUT? LITTLE POSTER BOARDS BLOW UP AND I THINK IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE WITNESS, SHE IS SAYING, THAT IS NOT THE CORRECT CHARACTERIZATION. SO WHEN YOU ASK OVERALL TWITTER ADVICE, WHICH IS, IF YOUR TWEET HAS NUANCE OR NEEDS CONTEXT, DON'T TWEET IT. RULE NUMBER ONE.  Katie: SHE WAS CERTAINLY CAUGHT OFF GUARD AND NANCY MACE TALKS ABOUT THAT CONTEXT, LISTEN.  THERE REALLY ARE NO WORDS AND SHE WANTED CONTEXT. THERE IS NO CONTEXT I READ YOUR WORD FOR WORD AND YOU ARE BEING A HYPOCRITE COMING IN HERE TALKING ABOUT HATE SPEECH AND VIOLENT RHETORIC. YOU WERE THE VERY PERSON USING HATE SPEECH AND VIOLENT RHETORIC TO PUT PEOPLE'S LIVES AND DANGER.  Katie: THE OBVIOUS.  Greg: SHE REALLY SHOWED \"THEY.\" YOU KNOW, I LOVE MOMENTS LIKE THESE. IT IS GREAT WHEN YOU WERE A KID AND WATCHED HAPPY DAYS AND FONZIE WOULD BEAT UP THE BULLY. OR BIGFOOT, GREAT TV MOMENT WHERE THE PERSON WHO DESERVES IT AS IT COMING. THEY ARE LIKE TERRIBLE PEOPLE AT THESE HEARINGS. SHE HAS NOT EVEN THE WORST. THEY ARE THE PEOPLE THEY ARE SAYING PARENT SHOULD NOT BE TOLD THEIR KIDS ARE SEEKING TRANSITION. THIS IS A COLT. IT IS A CULT AND ALSO, I THINK SO, RIGHT? ANYWAY SHE MAKES A GREAT POINT. ATTEMPTING TO CENSOR ANYBODY BY LANGUAGE OF INCITEMENT, IT CAN BE USED ON ANYBODY AND ON ANYBODY BECAUSE SO OPEN TO INTERPRETATION OF THE WAY THIS INFORMATION/DISINFORMATION AND ESPECIALLY HATE SPEECH AS WE HAVE SEEN THIS BROADEN, BROADEN, BROADEN AND THIS ACTRESS MIGHT LEARN FROM THIS, NO, SHE BLOCKED NANCY MACE. SHE WALKED HER ON TWITTER. THAT WAS THE LESSON -- SHE DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR FROM HER AGAIN. SHE ALSO BLOCKED ME. I THINK SHE BLOCKED EVERYBODY FROM FOX. IT JUST SHOWS SHE PREFERS TO LIVE IN HER OWN BUBBLE. SHE PREFERS TO LIVE HER COGNITIVE BIAS. SHE COMMITS THE CRIME OF SAYING INCOME I HOPE KATIE PAVLICH GETS ATTACKED, SHE DOESN'T SEE THAT THE SAME WAY SOMEBODY WOULD SAY, YOU SHOULD GET ATTACKED BECAUSE SHE IS IN HER BUBBLE. SHE CAN'T SEE -- SHE ONLY SEES THE CRIME OF THE PERSON SHE HATES IS DOING.  Katie: WE HEAR THE THREATS TO DEMOCRACY OR A VERY SERIOUS AND WHAT GOES ON ON TWITTER NEEDS TO BE TAKEN SERIOUS. ELON MUSK IS ALLOWING PLETHORA OF HATE SPEECH TO THRIVE ON THE PLATFORM AND YET, PEOPLE LIKE THIS DO IT, THEY THINK IT IS OKAY AND THERE WAS NO RECOURSE FOR THEM.  Jessica: WE WILL SEE IF THERE IS SOME RECOURSE. THIS HAS GONE VIRAL AND SPEAKS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING REPRESENTATIVES ON BOTH SIDES LIKE NANCY MACE WHO REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS RESPECT. THIS IS NOT A FLAME THROWING PERSON OR SOMEONE WHO USES HER LANGUAGE FASTLY LOOSE. THIS IS A PERSON WHO TAKES HER JOB SERIOUSLY. THAT IS WHY THAT WAS SO EFFECTIVE. AND SHE WAS ON HER NETWORK AND WENT ON A LIBERAL NETWORK AND GIVING INTERVIEWS. THINKERS OF THE OTHER PARTY. THAT IS IMPORTANT HERE THAT IS HOW YOU MAKE YOUR MESSAGE HEARD SHOWING UP IN PEOPLE WHERE PEOPLE WOULDN'T EXPECT YOU TO BE THERE. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT TOOK AWAY FROM IT. I THINK IT IS INTERESTING BECAUSE I THINK IT MIRRORS TWITTER FILES INSTALLMENT 3 OR R IT WAS, DONALD TRUMP'S TWEET WAS INCITING VIOLENCE AND IN HINGED ON WHO ARE THE AMERICAN PATRIOTS? WHO IS HE TALKING TO? IS HE TALKING THE GUYS WHO STORMS A CAPITAL OR JUST TALKING TO AMERICAN PATRIOTS AT LARGE AND PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM SITTING AT HOME IN KENTUCKY MINDING THEIR OWN BUSINESS? WE HAVE TO SPEND MORE TIME THINKING ABOUT WHAT REALLY INCITES VIOLENCE? IS AT ALL FLAT OUT ON THE PAGE? IS IT HOW SOMEONE INTERPRETS IT AND GO INTO THEM BASED ON IT? WHAT KIND OF INTENT PUSH MARK THAT WOMAN TESTIFYING, DOES SHE WANT THEM TO SHOW UP AT ALL OF THEIR HOUSES?  Katie: PEOPLE DID SHOW UP. AND WANTED TO KILL SUPREME COURT JUSTICE BRETT KAVANAUGH. JESSIE, DO YOU NOT TWEET BECAUSE YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT GETTING COLD IN FRONT OF THE CONGRESS TO TEST ABOUT SOMETHING SOMEDAY?  Jesse: JOHNNY TWEETS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE SAYS, BUT I HAVEN'T GOT IN TROUBLE SO FAR SO HE IS DOING A GREAT JOB. THIS IS THE LIBERAL LOGIC. IF I CALL A TRANSSEXUAL, HE, THEY WILL SAY, \"OH, YOU'RE CAUSING VIOLENCE.\" BUT IF THE TRANSSEXUAL SAYS \"A MOB NEEDS TO GO LOOSE ON A JUSTICE'S HOUSE. THAT IS FREE SPEECH AND THAT IS B.S. THAT ARGUMENT DOESN'T GET A FAIR SHAKE IN THE MEDIA. SO, IF YOU SAY ANYTHING, THE MEDIA WILL SAY, YOU'RE CAUSING VIOLENCE AND NOT ONLY ARE YOU CAUSING VIOLENCE, THEY ARE CAUSING VIOLENCE TO THE MOST VULNERABLE, TO THOSE MOST OPPRESSED. NOBODY WANTS TO CAUSE VIOLENCE TO ANYBODY. YOU CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID AT THAT POINT! SO JUST ANOTHER WAY TO CENSOR YOU. I WILL NOT STAND FOR IT!  Greg: WAY TO STAND UP FOR FREE SPEECH, JESSE!  Jesse: I WILL STAND UP! [LAUGHTER]  Katie: YOU ARE IN A MOOD TODAY.  Jessica: A LIBERAL FEDERAL JUDGE WHOSE SON WAS GUNNED DOWN AND HER HUSBAND WAS SHOT AS WELL. SO THERE IS REAL VIOLENCE.  Jesse: YOU GUYS DEFUND THE POLICE! SAME THING.  Katie: GOT TO GO.

I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S A CORRECT CHARACTERIZATION OF MY STATEMENTS.  YOU TWEETED IT THOUGH.  Ainsley: IT CAN BE VERY DANGEROUS. WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE JUSTICES. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOU. WHAT WENT ON AFTER THAT?  JUST ASTOUNDING TO SEE SOMEONE SHOW UP IN COMMITTEE AND COMMIT TO SAYING RHETORIC ONLINE IS DANGEROUS. TARGETING OFFICIALS WITHIN OUR GOVERNMENT IS DANGEROUS.

SHE WANTED TO PROVIDE CONTEXT. THERE IS NO CONTEXT. I LITERALLY READ YOUR WORD FOR WORD AND YOU ARE BEING A HYPOCRITE COMING IN HERE SPEAKING OUT AGAINST HATE SPEECH.

AND WHEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN FEAR BECAUSE OF WHAT SOMEONE MIGHT SAY OR THEN WORSE YET WHAT THEY MIGHT BE. IT'S A RESULT OF WHAT PEOPLE HAVE DONE ON SOCIAL MEDIA. ESCALATING THE RHETORIC. AND IT HAS CONSEQUENCES. I HAVE SEEN IT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. WHAT YOU SAW ON TUESDAY IS JUST A PREVIEW OF WHAT'S TO COME. REPUBLICANS IN THE MAJORITY NEXT YEAR, THERE'S NEW MANAGEMENT IN TOWN ON OVERSIGHT. AND WE ARE GOING TO TREAT EVERY WITNESS THIS WAY TO GET TO THE TRUTH TO HAVE THESE INVESTIGATIONS AND TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE.  Ainsley: WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT? THAT IS DANGEROUS WHEN SOCIAL MEDIA ALLOWS GO OUT TO THE PUBLIC IT PUTS PEOPLE'S LIVES AT RISK.  RIGHT. I'M A BIG FAN OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. AND I BELIEVE IN IT.  BUT WHEN YOU ARE THREATENING PEOPLE'S LIVES ENCOURAGING VIOLENCE. THAT'S WHEN WE HAVE GOT TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND HAVE THE COURAGE TO CALL IT OUT LIKE WE DID ON TUESDAY. YOU NEED TO BE CALLED OUT WHEN YOU ARE ADVOCATING TO ACCOST PEOPLE IN PUBLIC. THAT YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE JUS S SOMEONE TO, LIKE THEY DID WITH JUSTICE KAVANAUGH TO BRING A KNIFE, TO BRING A LOADED GUN AND USE VIOLENCE AGAINST OTHERS. THE UNITED STATES, CITING BEING BURNED DOWN BY THE GROUPS THESE GROUPS ANTIFA AND ANARCHISTS. I GET THREATENED WITH MY LIFE THE MINUTE I BRING UP THE WORD ANTIFA I AM TOLD I SHOULD DIE. THAT'S JUST WRONG. I'M NOT GOING TO TOLERATE THIS KIND OF NONSENSE. LEAD BY EXAMPLE AND SHOWING PEOPLE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE TOLERATED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. I PROVED THAT AND HAVE BEEN TRUE TO MY WORD IN THAT REGARD.  Ainsley: CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON WITH US.  THANK YOU.  Ainsley: YOU ARE WELCOME. COMING UP FOX NATION HOST NANCY GRACE IS GOING TO JOIN US LIVE. FIRST, IT MIGHT NOT BE DINING AND DASHING OR SHOPLIFTING, BUT CASES OF FRIENDLY FRAUD ARE ON THE RISE. AND THREATENING THE SMALL BUSINESSES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. THAT'S COMING UP NEXT. \u266a 20221215114710.909|20221215115129.901",

        "trs": " NOW ON YESTERDAY AND CAPITOL HILL CAN CONGRESSWOMAN WAS PRAISED FOR EXPOSING A FAR LESS ACTIVIST WHO CLAIMS TO BE AGAINST VIOLENT RHETORIC BUT ALSO CALLS FOR SUPREME COURT JUSTICES TO BE ACCOSTED. WATCH THIS EXCHANGE.  AS RHETORIC ON SOCIAL MEDIA, PROBLEM OF THE THREAT TO DEMOCRACY MR. WARNER?  YES, ABSOLUTELY.  MR. SIEGEL?  YES. MR. MONEY? YES.  ONLY A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE ATTEMPTED ATTACK ON JUNE 25TH, 1 OF THE WITNESSES TWEETED OUT THE FOLLOWING A RESPONSE A DECISION ON ABORTION, OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE AND I'LL QUOTE DIRECTLY FROM THE TWEAK, THE SIX JUSTICES SHOULD NEVER KNOW PEACE AGAIN. IT IS OUR CIVIC DUTY TO A COST TO THEM, EVERY TIME THEY ARE IN PUBLIC. THEY ARE PARIAHS. SINCE WOMEN DO NOT HAVE THEIR RIGHTS THESE JUSTICES SHOULD NEVER HAVE A PEACEFUL MOMENT IN PUBLIC AGAIN. I HAVE A QUESTION IS THAT YES OR NO DO YOU BELIEVE YOUR RHETORIC IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY WHEN YOU'RE CALLING TO ACCOST A BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT, THE SUPREME COURT?  I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S THE CORRECT CHARACTERIZATION.  DID YOU NOT TO EAT THAT? THAT YOU THOUGHT THAT THE PER SUPREME COURT JUSTICES SHOULD BE ACCOSTED.  WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT THAT IS NOT AN ACCURATE CHARACTERIZATION OF MY STATEMENTS.  ALL OF THE SAME PEOPLE THAT CLAIM TO BE SO CONCERNED ABOUT VIOLENCE AND THREATS TO DEMOCRACY, THERE ARE ALSO THE WANTED TIME THERE SPEWING HATE THEMSELVES. ANYWAY HERE WITH MORE REPUBLIC CONGRESSWOMAN FROM SOUTH CAROLINA NANCY MACE IS WITH US. THERE WAS A A PRETTY BRILLIANT EXCHANGE, IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY. THEY REALLY DIDN'T DENY THAT THAT WAS THERE TO RIGHT PLACE. THEY LEARNED NO SHE COULDN'T DENY IT DOES WITH HER WORDS IN BLACK AND WHITE FROM TWITTER THAT WERE DISPLAYED ON THE BOARD BEHIND ME, AND HERE'S A SIGNIFICANTLY HYPOCRITE WHO ADVOCATES VIOLENCE ONLINE YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T DO IT, BEFORE ME AND MY COMMITTEE. BECAUSE WHAT YOU SAW YESTERDAY TO PROVE PREVIEW OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN NEXT YEAR WHEN THERE IS NO MANAGEMENT INTERN IN OVERSIGHT, WHEN YOU COME INTO THAT ROOM TO TESTIFY, WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU FOR THE HYPOCRITES THAT YOU ARE BECAUSE THIS ONE STANDARD FOR THE LEFT, THEN THIS IS STANDARD FOR EVERYBODY ELSE. AND WHEN YOU RIGHTLY POINTED IT OUT SEAN. THESE PEOPLE ARE COMING IN FRONT OF OUR COMMUNITY TO TESTIFY IN SPEAKING OUT AGAINST HATE SPEECH IS SPEAKING OUT AGAINST VIOLENT RHETORIC AS WE ALL SHOULD. AND THESE ARE THE SAME, THE VERY SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE USING HATE SPEECH USING VIOLENT RHETORIC AGAINST THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. IN THE HYPOCRITES FOR.  YOU KNOW, AS WE WATCH DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY OF THE MONTH OF THE MONTH OF THE MONTH FOR JANUARY 6 HEARINGS, AND I WAS ON RADIO REAL-TIME WHAT WAS HAPPENING. IN A CONDEMNED THE NEW REAL-TIME AND HAD CONTENDED THAT NIGHT ON THE SHELF. THEY HAVE THE SUMMER BEFORE IN SUMMER 202020, WE HAVE 5,000,074 RIOTS, WE HAD TO THOUSANDS INJURED COPS, DOZENS OF DEAD AMERICANS, BENDS OR PROPERTY DAMAGE HOW COME THERE'S NEVER BEEN A COMMITTEE LOOKING INTO THOSE ALLIANCES? DOESN'T THAT SEEM HYPOCRITICAL.  VERY HYPOCRITICAL. AND FOR THE RECORD THEY DO NOT QUANTIFY ANTIFA CRIMES, AND THEY'VE NEVER CHARGE A MEMBER OF NT FOR THESE ANARCHIST GROUPS TO CAUSE DISCUSSION AROUND THE COUNTRY WHICH IS STRAIGHT. AND I MENTIONED IN MY HEARING YESTERDAY THAN I'VE BEEN A VICTIM OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE, I'VE HAD MY CAR KEYED, MY HOUSE VACATED, RECENTLY EARLIER THIS YEAR I HAD HOUSE TRESPASSED. AGAIN FOR THE SIGHT OF HIM IN ABOUT A YEAR, AND I DEAL WITH THREATS DAY IN AND DAY OUT BECAUSE I SOMETIMES TAKE POSITION THE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE I'M IN A PURPLE DISTRICT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS, WE HAVE TO STAND YOUR GROUND AND STEAK AT THOSE POSITIONS BUT I CARRY A GUN EVERYWHERE YOU KNOW WHEN I'M BACK HOME BECAUSE OF THE RHETORIC THAT I SEEN OUT THERE BECAUSE OF THE FEDS HAVE BEEN ACCOSTED ON THE STREETS IN PUBLIC PHYSICALLY AND VERBALLY AND IT IS NOT OKAY IN THE SEE THESE PEOPLE COME TO CONGRESS AND SEE THE HYPOCRISY OF THE CONSTITUTION AND SEE HYPOCRISY AND WHAT THEY BELIEVE DEMOCRACY SHOULD BE, IT IS NOT HERE WHEN WE'VE HAD THIS BEAUTIFUL DOCUMENT OF THIS FOUNDING FATHERS WE SHOULD BE HOLDING PEOPLE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW REGARDLESS IF THEY HAVE AN ART OR A DEED BY THEIR NAME EVEN ABOUT CONDEMNING CERTAIN PEOPLE, AND WE SHOULDN'T BE BUT WE SHOULD ALSO BE HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. ONLY SHOWED UP AT THE STEPS OF SUPREME COURT DUBSTEP WITH A KNIFE, LOADED PISTOL READY TO KILL HIM AND HIMSELF. AND WE NEED TO PUT A STOP TO THIS NONSENSE IS FINISHED START JANUARY 3RD.  I AGREE COMPLETELY. AND AS A TALK SHOW HOST, I'VE HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCES YOU HAVE AND MANY OTHERS. AND IT SHOULD STOP. RS CONGRESSWOMAN THANK YOU TOMORROW WITH HANNITY RIGHT AFTER THIS.

        "trs": " REPUBLICAN CONGRESSWOMAN NANCY MACE HAS TURNED THE TABLES ON A TRANSGENDER RIGHTS WITNESS, AND IT HAPPENED DURING A HOUSE HEARING ON EXTREMIST RHETORIC. YOU KNOW, SHE'S FROM THE GREAT STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA. AND MACE USED THE WITNESS' OWN PAST VIOLENT TWEETS TO CALL OUT THE LIBERAL ACTIVIST HYPOCRISY. JUST WATCH HER.  ONLY A FEW WEEKS AFTER THE ATTEMPTED ATTACK ON THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ON JUNE 25th, ONE OF THE WITNESSES TWEETED OUT THE FOLLOWING IN RESPONSE TO A DECISION ON ABORTION. THE SIX JUSTICES WHO OVERTURNED ROE SHOULD NEVER KNOW PEACE AGAIN. IT IS OUR CIVIC DUTY TO ACCOST THEM EVERY TIME THEY'RE IN PUBLIC. THEY ARE PARIAHS. SINCE WOMEN DON'T HAVE THEIR RIGHTS, THESE JUSTICES SHOULD NEVER HAVE A PEACEFUL MOMENT IN PUBLIC AGAIN. DO YOU BELIEVE YOUR RHETORIC IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY?  I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S A CORRECT CHARACTERIZATION OF MY STATEMENTS.  DID YOU NOT TWEET THAT, THAT YOU THOUGHT THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES SHOULD BE ACCOSTED?  WHAT I'M SAYING IS -- THAT'S NOT AN ACCURATE CHARACTERIZATION OF MY STATEMENT.  I'M SORRY, YOU HAVE 140 CHARACTERS. DO YOU GET CHARACTERIZATION WITH THAT OR CAN WE GO WITH THE WORD ACCOST? DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER MEANING.  DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S A GRAY AREA, WHAT SHE WAS TWEETING. NO ONE THOUGHT TO VENT THOSE TWEETS BEFORE THEY CALLED HER IN TO BE A WITNESS, AND VENTED HER RHETORIC BEFORE SHE ALLOWED HER TO BE A TEACHER AT ONE OF OUR HIGHER INSTITUTIONS OF LEARNING. WE HAVE TO DO OUR OWN RESEARCH BEFORE WE ALLOW OUR KIDS TO GO INTO THESE CLASSROOMS. NOT JUST HARVARD AND IVY. IT'S ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. THAT'S THE MENTALITY IN CLASSROOMS. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT, THOUGH,.  THINK WHERE SHE IS REFLEXIVELY, BLAME THE CONGRESSWOMAN, NOT OTHER HEN TWEETS, GETS CAUGHT, AND THAT'S WHO YOU WANT IN THE CLASSROOM?  BUT IT'S THE CONGRESSWOMAN CLEARLY TAKING HER COMMENTS OUT OF CONTEXT. THE OTHER THING WITH THE LEFT, IT'S ONLY BAD AND ONLY WRONG AND ONLY A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY WHEN YOU DISAGREE WITH THEM. BUT IT'S HAPPENING ON THE LEFT. I WORKED ON CAPITOL HILL FOR OVER 10 YEARS. THE THREATS THAT WOULD COME IN TO MEMBERS FOR CONGRESS I WORKED FOR HAVE BEEN HAPPENING FOR YEARS, BUT WE'RE JUST NOT POSTING THEM ONLINE ALL THE TIME OR DON'T HAVE THE LEGACY MEDIA AT OUR DISPOSAL TO COVER FOR US. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. THE DIVISIVENESS IS HAPPENING. POOR STAFF WORK ON THE PART OF THAT DEMOCRATIC STAFFER WHO DIDN'T THINK TO VENT HER TWEETS THAT WOULD COME BACK TO HAUNT THEM IN THAT CONVERSATION.  THE MISSTEPS THAT CASSIE POINTS OUT, THE FACT THAT DEMOCRATS PUT THIS PERSON UP THERE, AND SECOND THAT THIS PERSON DIDN'T HAVE A PREPARED ANSWER FOR THAT. I THINK THAT HIGHLIGHTS A MUCH BIGGER CONCLUDES, THAT THE LEFT IS NOT EMBARRASSED BY THIS. THEY HAVE NO SHAME WHEN IT COMES TO DOING THIS, BECAUSE IN THEIR VIEW OF DEMOCRACY IT IS A VERY ONE-SIDED VIEW OF DEMOCRACY, AND THE INTIMIDATION OF CONSERVATIVES IS JUST PART OF THE DEMOCRACY THAT THEY ESPOUSE. THERE'S NO SHAME THERE. THERE'S NO EMBARRASSMENT. EVEN THOUGH LOGICAL PEOPLE, YOU WOULD ASSUME THERE WOULD BE, YOU WERE UNPREPARED, DIDN'T VET THIS THROUGH. I GOT THE IMPRESSION THEY KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THEY WERE GETTING, AND THEY DON'T CARE.  THEY ALSO HAVE ENJOYED -- WE DIDN'T KNOW THIS UNTIL RECENTLY, UNTIL ELON MUSK BOUGHT THE PLATFORM OF TWITTER -- BUT ENJOYED COMPLICITY IN THEIR JOURNEY.  ONE STEP FURTHER. IT'S NOT THAT THEY DIDN'T VET HER. THEY LOVE IT. HARVARD LAW SCHOOL ENJOYS HAVING HER AS A PROFESSOR.  SHE'S NOT A PROFESSOR.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I PROMOTED HER ACCIDENTALLY. SO TO YOUR POINT, IT'S PART OF THEIR FABRIC. I LOVE HOW THE CONGRESSWOMAN CALLED HER OUT. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, THE WHOLE POINT OF TWITTER IS THAT WE GET WHAT WE SEE. YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO QUALIFY, UNLESS YOU PUT A STRING -- I WONDER IF ALL OF THOSE EXTREMISTS THAT HAVE BEEN KNO PE CLINICS, WHAT TWEET DID THEY READ? DID SOMEONE INTERVIEW YOU, AND SAY HOW ARE YOU GALVANIZED TO DO THIS? HOW ARE YOU INFLUENCED? WHEN I WAS A MANAGING ATTORNEY, I GOT DEATH THREATS, I GOT TO CALL FEDERAL PROTECTIVE SERVICE, BUT WHAT CAN YOU CALL OFF A TWEET? REMEMBER, THIS WAS AFTER JUSTICE KAVANAUGH ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION.  AND THE DEAFNESS WHEN SENATOR TIM SCOTT HAD A RACIAL SLUR TRENDING, AND THEN MA TR. YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT MISCHARACTERIZATION. IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR, TOO, A RACIAL SLUR AGAINST A SITTING MEMBER OF THE U.S. SENATE.  I REMEMBER WHEN PAUL PELL PELOSI,AND THE OUTRAGE. THE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN SOMEONE FEELS INSPIRED BY YOU. IT JOSTLES THEM INTO ACTION, BECAUSE WHEN SOMEONE READS THESE PEOPLE SHOULD BE ACCOSTED, WE SHOULD ACCOST THEM, THAT ONLY MEANS ONE THING. THAT DOESN'T MEAN GETTING SASSY WITH THEM AND WAVING YOUR FINGER. IT MEANS PHYSICALLY ASSAULTING SOMEBODY. THIS IS INCREDIBLY RESPONSIBLE. IT SHOULD BE CONDEMNED FROM EVERY SIDE. YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT JUST HAPPENING ON THE LEFT OR ON THE RIGHT, YOU KNOW. THIS SORT OF JUSTIFIED VIOLENCE, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF THE CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING ABOUT ABORTION RIGHT NOW, PEOPLE FEEL JUSTIFIED IN HURTING AND KILLING OTHER PEOPLE. THINGS LIKE THAT, FROM SOMEONE IN A POSITION OF POWER, OF ACADEMIC POWER, THAT MAKES EVERYTHING SO MUCH WORSE. I LOVE NANCY MACE. I'M GLAD SHE CALLED THAT WOMAN ON HER CONTEXT.  YES.  AND CHARACTERIZATION. THAT'S THE CHARACTERIZATION. THAT'S IT. THANK YOU FOR SAVING IT UP.  CONGRESSWOMAN MACE OPENS UP A WIDE DOOR TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS PROTECTED SPEECH IS AND IS NOT. WE'LL DO THAT ON ANOTHER DAY. COMING UP, THE MEDIA COMING AGAIN TO THE VICE PRESIDENT'S DEFENSE, SAYING KAMALA HARRIS IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN SHE LOOKS. OH, MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS! SHE SAID THAT OUT LOUD? OKAY. THEY CALL HER FORMIDABLE FOR A CONTENDER IN THE WHITE HOUSE. FORMIDABLE. 20221214172206.740|20221214172615.755",

        "trs": "I IMAGINE MY FINAL DAYS, I SEE BUBBLES. I SEE THE OCEAN. I SEE MUSIC. EVEN NOW, AS I SEEK HELP TO END MY LIFE, THERE'S JUST SO MUCH BEAUTY. YOU HAVE TO BE BRAVE ENOUGH TO SEE IT.  TWO WEEKS AGO, WE SHOWED YOU THAT AD. IT'S PRO EUTHANASIA PRODUCED BY A CANADIAN FASHION AND HOME GOODS RETAILER. THEY STAGE EXCURSIONS FOR THIS YOUNG WOMAN BEFORE HER DEATH AS A BRAND BUILDING EXERCISE. WELL, SINCE THEN, WE LEARNED FROM HER FRIENDS THAT SHE WANTED TO LIVE. BUT THE GLORIFICATION OF DEATH IN CANADA HAS GOTTEN SO PERVASIVE THAT SHE GAVE IN TO THE EXTERNAL PRESSURES. YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD SLOW THE PUSH DOWN IN CANADA. BUT TO THE CONTRARY, CANADA HAS SAID THAT THEY WANT TO EXPAND THEIR PUSH FOR ASSISTED SUICIDE. STARTING IN MARCH, PEOPLE WHOSE SOLE UNDERLYING CONDITION IS MENTAL ILLNESS WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS WHAT THEY CALL ASSISTED DEATH. JOINING US NOW IS THE EDITOR IN CHIEF OF REBEL NEWS SHEILA GONREE. SHE WAS RUNNING A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO FORCE THE GOVERNMENT TO END THIS PRACTICE. SHEILA, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAIN STREAMING DEPRAVITY ON THE ANGLE. LIFE IS DISPOSABLE IN THE WORLD TODAY, IT SEEMS. BUT THIS REALLY DOES KIND OF TAKE THE CAKE.  IT IS TRUE, LAURA, THAT CANADA IS BLOWING RIGHT PAST SCANDINAVIA IN OUR QUEST TO HIT THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIPPERY SLOPE FASTER THAN EVERYBODY ELSE. WE HEARD THIS MANTRA BEFORE. THEY TOLD US THIS ABOUT ABORTION, MEDICAL ASSISTANCE OF DYING WOULD BE SAFE, RARE, AND ONLY IN THE MOST DIRE OF CIRCUMSTANCES. WE KNOW WITH ABORTION, THAT'S NOT TRUE. WE KNOW AT LEAST 10,000 PEOPLE PER YEAR IN CANADA ARE RECEIVING MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN DYING UP THERE WITH OUR COVID DEATH NUMBERS. WE CAN'T KNOW FOR SURE. BECAUSE THERE'S SOME MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS THAT ARE ADVISING DOCTORS TO NOT RECORD MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN DYING AS THE REASON FOR THE DEATH BUT RATHER RECORD THE REASON THEY SOUGHT MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN DYING. THIS IS REALLY JUST THE NEXT STEP IN OUR DECENT INTO DARKNESS BECAUSE WE ALSO REMOVED THE TEN-DAY WAIT TIME FROM WHEN YOU ASK FOR DYING AND RECEIVE IT. IT CAN HAPPEN ON THE SAME DAY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY CHALLENGING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING MENTAL ILLNESS BECAUSE THOSE FEELINGS CAN SORT OF EBB AND FLOW AND SOMEONE EXPERIENCING ACUTE PTSD MIGHT ASK FOR AND RECEIVE ASSISTANCE.  LAURA: LET ME JUMP IN HERE. THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE IS ALMOST LIKE THEY PREFER TO GET RID OF THESE PEOPLE. LIKE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH TO, YOU KNOW, TO GO THROUGH THIS ASSISTED DEATH, WHATEVER THEY CALL IT, TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL BETTER. IT'S SICKENING. WHAT ARE ALL OF THE MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATES. WHERE ARE THEY? I DON'T SEE THEM IN THE UNITED STATES SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THIS. I WANT TO GET TO ANOTHER HORRIBLE CASE OUT OF CANADA. A CANADIAN PENSIONER SEEKING EUTHANASIA BECAUSE HE FEARS HOMELESSNESS RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM A DOCTOR DESPITE POVERTY IS A MAJOR FACTOR IN HIS OWN DECISION TO END HIS LIFE. HE'S 65, HE SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO DIE BUT APPLIED FOR IT BECAUSE HE CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE COMFORTABLY. ASTONISHINGLY, A DOCTOR HAS GIVEN ONE OF THE TWO SIGNATURES REQUIRED FOR THIS TO GO FORWARD. SO NOW HOMELESSNESS, GET RID OF THE PEOPLE WITH THE MENTAL ILLNESS, THE HOMELESS, THE ELDERLY WILL BE PUSHED OFF OF THEIR MORTAL COILS. WHAT ELSE?  DIABETICS WITH EATING DISORDERS, VETERANS WITH ACUTE PTSD EPISODES OR WANTING WHEELCHAIR RAMPS FOR THEIR HOMES. THERE ARE FOUR VETERANS AFFAIRS CASEWORKERS WHO ADVISED UP TO NINE THAT WE KNOW OF VETERANS TO TAKE THEIR OWN LIVES INSTEAD OF CONTINUING TO ANNOY THESE VETERANS AFFAIRS CASEWORKERS WHO WERE PAID HANDSOMELY TO HELP THE VETERANS. THERE WAS A 91-YEAR-OLD LADY IN VANCOUVER WHO OPTED FOR MEDICAL HOMICIDE BECAUSE SHE FEARED GOING INTO ANOTHER COVID LOCKDOWN IN HER NURSING HOME. FRANKLY, WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE SHOULD BE A DIRE WARNING TO OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS. THIS IS END STAGE SOCIALIZED MEDICINE. THERE'S A PUSH BY THOSE WHO ARE POOR OR VULNERABLE, BUT IT'S AGONY FOR THE USERS OF OUR SYSTEM. IN CANADA, IF YOU NEED A KNEE SURGERY, YOU TIMELY GET INTO THE SYSTEM, IT'S 180 PLUS DAYS TO GET A KNEE SURGERY. THAT'S THE GOLD STANDARD. IF YOU GET IT AT 180 DAYS, IT'S A MIRACLE. IF YOU WANT MEDICAL ASSISTANCE IN DYING FOR THE PAIN CAUSED BY THE LACK OF MEDICAL CARE BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT RUNS THE SYSTEM HERE, YOU CAN GET MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND DYING IF YOU CAN GET THE SIGNATURES ON THE VERY SAME DAY.  LAURA: IT'S CLEAR THEY WANT PEOPLE OFF OF THE MEDICAL ROLLS. THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS UNDER STRESS. AMERICANS SHOULD PAY ATTENTION. OUR TOUR AROUND THE WORLD CONTINUES IN THE NETHERLANDS WHERE THE DUTCH PUSH TO ELIMINATE HUGE SWATHS OF FARMS IN THIS COUNTRY IS NOW GETTING A HUGE BOOST FROM NBC NEWS. NOT ONLY DID THEY FRAME THIS AS A MOVE LIKE A WORTHWHILE ENDEAVOR TO CURB GLOBAL EMISSIONS, THEY CONFLATE THE CONCERN OVER THE GLOBAL FOOD SUPPLY WITH SOME SORT OF LIKE CULTURE WAR. RADICALIZED BY THE OPPOSITION TO STRIP COVID MEASURES AND SPURRED ON BY CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT GLOBALISTS DISMANTLING NATIONAL DEMOCRACIES AND IMPORTING NONWHITE IMMIGRANTS TO HISTORICALLY WHITE COUNTRIES. VICTOR, YOU LIVE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA, THE BREAD BASKET OF THE UNITED STATES. BUT THEY WANT TO SHUT DOWN DEBATE HERE AND SAY IT'S JUST THE RIGHT WINGERS WHO ARE JUST TRYING TO PROTECT THE FARMERS IN THE NETHERLANDS. LIKE WHAT IS THIS REALLY ABOUT, VICTOR?  IT'S PRETTY PATHETIC, IT'S A PATHETIC USE OF A GOVERNMENT CONTROL BY A SMALL ELITE. THEY CAN'T ADDRESS THE EXISTENTIAL PROBLEM THAT CHINA AND INDIA ARE POLLUTING -- CONTRIBUTING 40% OF THE GREEN HOUSE GAS RELEASES OR THE LEAKS ARE CONTRIBUTED TO IT BY THE PRIVATE JET TRAVEL AND THEY PICK ON 17,000 DUTCH FARMERS, I MEAN, MY GOD, THESE PEOPLE ARE THE MOST EFFICIENT DAIRY FARMERS IN THE WORLD, THEY HAVE A GLOBAL REPUTATION FOR LAND STEWARDSHIP. WE WERE TOLD ALL DURING THE 90s, LAURA, WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO ORGANIC AND NATURAL FARMING, TOO MUCH CHEMICAL NITRATES AND THE DAIRY BECAME THE NEXUS WHERE EVERYBODY LOOKS FOR ORGANIC MANURES TO BE SUPPLIED BY THE DAIRIES. THEN WE'RE TOLD YOU HAVE TO INNOVATE IF YOU'RE ON THE FARM. FAMILY FARMERS HAVE TO GET WITH IT. A POUND OF MEAT OR MILK PRODUCED VERSUS THE UNIT OF METHANE GAS RELEASED, THE DUTCH ARE THE MOST EFFICIENT FARMERS IN THE WORLD. EVERYBODY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT DUTCH FARMING, DAIRY FARMING, FOR A MODEL FOR HOW TO BE SUSTAINABLE AND PROMOTE DEMOCRACY FOR KEEPING FARMERS ON THE LAND GENERATION AFTER GENERATION.  LAURA: ISN'T THIS A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE AS WELL.  IT'S SUICIDAL, IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.  LAURA: SORRY, VICTOR.  ABSOLUTELY.  LAURA: AND THAT'S BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T CONTROL YOUR OWN FOOD SUPPLY, AS A PEOPLE, YOU -- YOU ARE DEEPLY VULNERABLE TO EXPLOITATION AND COERCION FROM GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES.  AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN FARMERS ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD, THEY'RE THE MOST EFFICIENT. IT WOULD BE INSANE TO GO WITHOUT THEM. I DON'T KNOW WHY WE DO THIS, WE GOT TO STOP IT. THESE ARE OUR STRENGTHS, OUR ASSET FARMERS. THEY'RE SACROSANCT. TO GO AFTER IT IS A CRIME.  THANK YOU SO MUCH. ELON JOINS DAVE CHAPPELL ON STAGE. AND MEDIA MISSED THE POINT. HUNTER BIDEN BACK TO SELLING HIS ART. RAYMOND ARROYO HAS ALL OF THE DETAILS SEEN AND UNSEEN IS NEXT. UNSEEN SEGMENT. WE EXPOSE THE STORIES BEHIND THE HEADLINES. THE FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR RAYMOND ARROYO. THERE WERE SOME STAGE STUMBLES OVER THE WEEKEND.  YEAH, LEGENDARY SINGER PATTY LABELLE HAD JUST STARTED HER CHRISTMAS SHOW IN MILWAUKEE WHEN THERE WAS A BOMB THREAT.  HOLD ON -- WAIT!  WHAT?  LAURA, I LOVE HER INDIGNATION. WAIT, WAIT, WITH THE SECURITY GUARDS. THANKFULLY THE BOMB THREAT WAS A FRAUD. CNN ALSO BOMBED WHILE PERPETUATING A FRAUD. THIS IS THEIR COVERAGE OF DAVE CHA'PELLE'S LATEST STAGE PARTNERSHIP IN SAN FRANCISCO.  COMEDIAN DAVE CHA'PELLE BROUGHT OUT ELON MUSK ON STAGE AND MUSK WAS MOVED FOR SEVERAL MINUTES.  MAKE SOME NOISE FOR THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD.  YEAH!  HE HAS TIME TO GO TO A DAVE CHA'PELLE SHOW? RUNNING TWITTER. TESLA'S NOT ENOUGH.  HE'S ON RIGHT WING POLITICS SO WHEN HE SHOWS UP AT SAN FRANCISCO IN A COMEDY SHOW, TOUGH RECEPTION.  YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T REPORT, LAURA? THE CONTEXT OF WHY PEOPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO MIGHT BE BOOING. AND IT WAS MOSTLY CHEERS, BY THE WAY, AS YOU HEARD THERE. BUT MUSK DID FIRE HALF OF THE TWITTER WORKFORCE IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND THEN THERE WERE THOSE TWITTER FILES THAT NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT, APPARENTLY.  HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW -- HE'S GIVING THEM A PLACE TO SLEEP IF THEY NEED TO STAY A FEW EXTRA HOURS IN SAN FRANCISCO FOR WHICH HE'S GETTING INVESTIGATED, I THINK.  A LITTLE COT. ACCORDING TO OUR PAL, TOM ELLIOTT, CNN MENTIONED THE TWITTER FILES, THE GOVERNMENT COORDINATED CENSORSHIP WITH TWITTER ONLY 13 TIMES SINCE DECEMBER 2. SO THE COVER MUSK GETTING ASKED, BUT NOT FREE SPEECH. GONE.  THEY DON'T COVER IT AS FREE SPEECH. THEY COVER IT AS AN OBSESSION OF RIGHT WING CONSPIRACY THEORISTS. THEY SAID TWITTER MANAGING THE CHAOS OF JANUARY 6, TRYING TO MANAGE ALL OF THAT, PEOPLE ARE UPSET. SO THEY KIND OF BLOW IT OFF. THEY DON'T REALLY COVER IT. THEY COVER IT UP.  I KNOW YOU'RE AN ART LOVER. HUNTER BIDE B IS THE MICHELANGELO OF SOHO. HE RETURNED TO THE GEORGE BURGESS GALLERY WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE HUNTER SOLD THREE MORE WORKS. ONE FIXED, $225,000. THE ETHICAL PROBLEMS ARE OBVIOUS. THE REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS ARE ABOUT TO INVESTIGATE THE ANONYMOUS BUYERS. IF YOUR OWN LAPTOP BOASTS DEALS WITH CHINA AND UKRAINE, YOU'D THINK IT STAYED OUT OF THE GALLERY, RIGHT?  NO, WAIT A MINUTE. HUNTER HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN ARTIST. THEY FOCUSED ON HIS ARTWORK, THEY SAID HE JUST STARTED DOING ART. HE LIVES AND BREATHES ART. THIS IS ALWAYS HIS SIDE THING.  LAURA, HUNTER BIDEN IS TO ART WHAT I AM TO GOLF, OKAY? I COULD NOT HIT A GOLF BALL WITH A BULLDOZER. THE MAN IS PROFIT -- THEY HAVE TO SHOW IT, THANKS A LOT, GUYS. THE MAN IS CLEARLY PROFITING OFF OF HIS FAMILY NAME. THAT'S THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THIS.  LAURA: YOU THINK.  BUT, YOU KNOW, HUNTER SAYS EVERY ONE OF HIS NEW PAINTINGS, LAURA, CONTAIN HAIKU, ONE OF THE JAPANESE POEMS. BE IT FROM AFAR, IT MIGHT BE HARD FOR PEOPLE TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. BUT WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO HUNTER'S MASTERPIECES, HIS INTENTION IS CLEAR -- YOU SEE WHAT'S WRITTEN THERE.  LAURA: OH.  WHAT A NICE HAIKU. THAT MIGHT BE THE SATIRICAL EDITION.  LAURA: HOKU? HAIKU? WE BOTH HAVE JOE BIDEN. IT'S THE END OF A LONG -- RAYMOND, DON'T YOU SENSE WE'RE ALL GETTING A LITTLE BIDENESQUE.  I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT UP JOE BIDEN. NONE OF THE HUNTER SALES OR THE APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY, NONE OF THAT IS DISTURBING TO JOE BIDEN. HE WAS IN THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT TODAY. GIVING A SPEECH AT THE TOYS FOR TOTS EVENT. THEY DO SUCH GOOD WORK. BUT WHEN IT WAS OVER, IT WAS UP TO A LITTLE GIRL TO LEAD BIDEN OFF STAGE. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO GO. IT WAS THE CHILD THAT HAD TO POINT AND GO, OH, I THINK IT'S THIS WAY, MR. PRESIDENT. THEY DO SAY A CHILD WILL LEAD THEM, LAURA. THEN JOE BIDEN SEEMED TO BE GOING TO HIS OWN SECOND CHILDHOOD. HE ENJOYED A LITTLE BIKE RIDE, WATCH THIS, YOU'LL LOVE THIS. HE GETS ON THE BIKE AND TAKES A, YOU KNOW, TRIES TO TAKE A RIDE. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME HE WAS ON A BIKE. THEN THINGS GOT REALLY WEIRD. YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GIVE A GIFT TO THE CHILD. BIDEN WANDERED OFF WITH A TOY FOR HIMSELF. TOYS FOR TOT BRAINS MAYBE WITH THIS EVENT.  LAURA: RAYMOND, WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR THE GOOD IN EVERY BIDEN EPISODE, GIVEN THE SEASON OF CHRISTMAS. I LIKE TO LOOK AT IT THIS WAY -- AT LEAST HE DIDN'T SNIFF HER WHEN SHE ESCORTED HIM OFF STAGE. SO THAT IS A GOOD  WELL, IT'S HARD TO SNIFF WHEN YOU'RE IN MOTION AND THE CHILD IS TRYING TO LEAD YOU. IT'S A LITTLE FAR AWAY.  LAURA: GIVE ME SOME MISTLETOE, MISSY.  GOD BLESS US, EVEN, EVEN JOE BIDEN, LAURA?  LAURA: WE'RE NOT GRINCHES HERE. GOOD TO SEE YOU. SHOCKING UPDATE TO THE STORY OF LOUDOUN COUNTY SCHOOL AND THE RAPE COVERED UP THERE AND A WARNING OF WHAT HAPPENED WHEN YOU FLUSH THE TOILET. YES, STAY THERE. TO SEE WHAT WE MEAN. HAVE ASSAULTS OCCURRING. THE ISSUE OF ASSAULTS TAKING PLACE OR TRANSGENDER STUDENTS ASSAULTING OTHER STUDENTS IN THE RESTROOM, \"TIME\" MAGAZINE IN 2016 CALLED THAT A RED HERRING. THE PREDATOR TRANSGENDER STUDENT IS OR PERSON SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST.  NOW WE KNOW THAT COMMENT FROM DISGRACED AND FORMER LOUDOUN COUNTY SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT WAS A LIE. LAST WEEK AFTER A DAMNING GRAND JURY REPORT EXPOSED HOW FAR THE DISTRICT WENT TO CONCEAL WHAT THEY KNEW ABOUT RAPES BY THE SUSPECTED TRANSGENDER STUDENT, THE SCHOOL BOARD VOTED TO FIRE HIM. AND TONIGHT, THE LOUDOUN COUNTY JUDGE UNSEALED THE INDICTMENTS AGAINST HIM AND THE OTHER EMPLOYEE. HE'S FACING MISDEMEANOR ACCOUNTS OF FALSE PUBLICATION, USING THE POSITION TO RETALIATE OR THREAT B TO RETALIATE AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE AND FALSELY FIRING THE SAME EMPLOYEE. THE SPOKESPERSON IS FACING ONE COUNT OF FELONY PERJURY. NOW, THE ANGLE BROUGHT YOU THIS STORY WHEN BROKE LAST YEAR. WE SPOKE TO THE REPORTER WHEN HE BROKE IT AND SECURED THE FIRST INTERVIEW OF THE FATHER OF THE GIRL THAT WAS RAPED. CONVERSELY, THIS IS HOW THE LEGACY MEDIA COVERED IT. MICHELLE GOLDBERG PENNED A PIECE BACK IN 2021 ENTITLED THE RIGHT'S BIG LIE ABOUT SEXUAL ASSAULT IN VIRGINIA. GOLDBERG WENT ON TO CALL IT A CULTURE WAR FANTASY THAT CREATED A NATION-WIDE MORAL PANIC. WELL, THERE ARE CLEAR BATTLE LINES DRAWN HERE. THOSE WHO WISH TO UNCOVER THIS DEVIENCY AS WE LAY IT OUT IN THE ANGLE IN THOSE THAT TRIED TO COVER IT UP AND THUS HURT THE KIDS LIKE SUPERINTENDENTS AND THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA, OR SO CALLED. TIME TO START ASKING WHY. NOW IT'S TIME FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT THIS MONDAY NIGHT. POOP AND LASERS? YES, YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT. A GROUP OF RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO BOULDER USED HIGH-POWERED LASERS TO CHECK OUT HOW FAR AND WIDE WATER DROPLETS FLY AFTER YOU FLUSH THE TOILET. WELL, THE VIDEO SPEAKS FOR ITSELF. OKAY, THAT'S GROSS. THE GREEN IS HOW FAR EVERYTHING FLIES WHEN YOU USE THE PUBLIC TOILET. SO THE DROPLETS AND AEROSOL FLUMES CAN SPREAD FECAL PERILS AND CONTAGIOUSS AND SOME SAY, COVID. DR. SIEGEL, GREAT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. NOW THE RESEARCH SAYS THE PLUMES CAN GO UP TO FIVE FEET IN THE AIR. OKAY? HOW DO WE COMBAT THIS? WHAT DO WE DO HERE, DOC?  THE STATE OF COLORADO IS NOT COMBATTING IT TOO WELL, LAURA. THEY'RE TAKING, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, WASTE WATER AND TRADING IT AND PUTTING IT IN THE TAP NOW. THAT'S THE NEXT THING. I CHECKED. THE RESEARCHERS ARE NOT ON PSYCHEDELIC MUSHROOMS WHICH WERE JUST LEGALIZED IN COLORADO. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS WAS A SERIOUS RESEARCH. BUT I DISCOVERED THERE'S 3.2 MILLION BACTERIA PER INCH IN TOILET WATER. SO, WHEN YOU SEE IT FLYING UP IN THE AIR LIKE THAT, THERE'S BACTERIA, THERE'S VIRUSES, AND, NO -- YEAH, THERE'S FLU, THERE'S COVID. AND, NO, NO MASK IS GOING TO HELP YOU IN THAT SITUATION. SO, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A REMINDER THAT BATHROOMS CAN BE PRETTY DIRTY. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT? YOU USE DISINFECTANT WATER. SECOND THING, HOW ABOUT CLOSING THE LID BEFORE YOU FLUSH THE TOILET. THAT WOULD BE PRETTY SMART TO DO, RIGHT? AGAIN, NO MASK WILL HELP YOU. BUT I THINK THIS IS A REMINDER THAT ALL OF THIS OBSESSION ON COVID, RIGHT? ONLY COVID, COVID, COVID MUMMIES, THIS IS BASIC PROBLEM THAT WE FACE IN OUR DAILY LIVES THAT WE CAN GET PRETTY SICK FROM THIS. SALMONELLA, E. COLI, AND VIRUSES, NORA VIRUSES IN TOILET WATER.  SO MANY STUDIES AND SURVEYS OF WASTE WATER. THERE WAS ONE IN MASSACHUSETTS, I REMEMBER, MAYBE A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, AND THERE HAVE BEEN OTHERS DONE ACROSS THE GLOBE WHERE THEY FOUND COVID IN THE WASTE WATER. SO, IT'S THERE. AND I GUESS YOU HAVE TO FLUSH AND RUN? I MEAN, IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COVER ON THE -- ON THE TOILET, I MEAN, YOU KIND OF HAVE TO FLUSH IT AND RUN OUT THE DOOR --  ONE HAND AS YOU RUN THE OTHER WAY. BUT YOU CLOSE THE LID. AND BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO TO STOP THE VIRUSES BEING THERE. AND ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IT'S NOT JUST COVID. IT'S BACTERIA. PEOPLE CAN GET SICK. ESPECIALLY IN THE PUBLIC TOILETS, ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY'RE NOT CLEAN PROPERLY.  LAURA: A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T FLUSH THEM RIGHT ANYWAY. WE DON'T WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE NOT TO FLUSH THE TOILET. THAT'S NOT THE MESSAGE OF THIS.  IT DOESN'T GET YOU OFF OF THE HOOK BY FLUSHING. THAT'S THE KEY. YOU STILL HAVE PLENTY OF TROUBLE.  LAURA: NOT JUST THE TOILETS. HOT HAIR HAND DRIERS IN PUBLIC RESTROOMS, THAT MIGHT BE A PROBLEM TOO. WATCH THIS.  WHEN YOU TURN ON THE DRIER, YOU VIRTUALLY BLOW GERMS ALL OVER THE PLACE, ON TO THE PEOPLE NEAR YOU, ON TO YOURSELF. THE PLATES NOT NEAR THE DRIER HAD ONE GERM COLONY ON THEM WHEN THEY WERE EXAMINED BUT THE PLATES HAD 18 TO 16 BACTERIA COLONIES PER PLATE AFTER THE DRIER HAD BEEN USED FOR 30 SECONDS.  LAURA: QUICKLY HERE, CAN WE JUST STICK TO PAPER TOWELS REAL QUICK?  ABSOLUTELY, PAPER TOWELS. BY THE WAY, IN FRONT OF THE TOILET, IT GETS DIRTY TOO. ONE LAST TIM, YOUR TOOTHBRUSH MAY BE THE DIRTIEST THING OF ALL. WASH IT WITH SOAP, PLEASE. CLEAR OFF OF THE THE THE TOOTHBRUSH, THERE'S BACTERIA ON THAT TOO. GET RID OF THE BLOW DRIERS AND USE THE PAPER TOWELS, ABSOLUTELY.  LAURA: DR. SIEGEL, SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU. EVEN ON THIS SLIGHTLY OFFBEAT TOPIC. GREAT TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU.

GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US THIS MORNING. TELL US, LET'S START WITH YOUR FRIEND. TELL US ABOUT HIM, HIS LIFE AND HIS SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY.  WELL RAUL, WE ALL KNEW HIM AS RHINO. THAT WAS HIS NICKNAME. HE WAS A WONDERFUL MAN. HE HAD THE UTMOST RESPECT OUT OF HIS TO COWORKERS. HE WAS PROBABLY THE BUSIEST, MOST WELL-ROUNDED AGENT THAT WE HAVE AT OUR STATION. IF HE WAS ALWAYS THERE WHEREVER ANYTHING WAS GOING ON, AND HE WAS TRULY LOVED BY ALL OF HIS COWORKERS AND FRIENDS. WILL: I BELIEVE -- WAS THAT AARON OR RAUL THAT JUST GAVE ME THAT ANSWER? I'M SORRY.  AARON. WILL: THANK YOU FOR THAT. SO I'LL GO TO YOU NOW, A RULE. RAUL GONZALEZ WAS KILLED IN A HIGH SPEED CHASE, WE LEARNED THIS WEEK. WE HEAR ABOUT THESE TYPES OF INCIDENCES QUITE OFTEN, RAUL. EL ME ABOUT THE MANNER -- TELL ME ABOUT HOW COMMON AND THE RISK THAT ALL OF YOU RUN THAT ULTIMATELY COST RAUL HIS HIGH.  GOOD MORNING. I'M RAUL RIVERA. FIRST OFF, RAUL WAS OUR DEAR FRIEND AND COWORKER, AND WE LOVED HIM, AND WE MISS HIM DEARLY. YEAH, EVERY DAY WE PUT OUR LIVES ON THE LINE JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND, YOU KNOW, WE PRAY BEFORE WE HEAD OUT THERE, AND WE'RE THANKFUL WHEN WE GET BACK HOME. IT WAS JUST AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED THAT EVENING WITH US, AND WE MISS HIM DEARLY. WILL: I IMAGINE YOU GUYS, YOU GUYS DO. HOW -- I'LL GO BACK TO YOU ON THIS ONE, AARON. AGAIN, AS YOUR FRIEND, HOW IS RAUL'S FAMILY DOING THROUGH THIS SITUATION?  THEY'RE STRUGGLING. THEY'RE HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME. HE HAD A FIANCEE AND CHILDREN THAT HE LEFT BEHIND. BUT THEY'RE -- AND THEIR CHILDREN THAT HE LEFT BEHIND, HE HAD A BOY AND A GIRL. AND HEIR ALL GOING THROUGH A -- THEY'RE ALL GOING THROUGH A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME, BUT WE'RE ALL PULLING TOGETHER, AND IS WE'RE, AS A WHOLE, BEING THERE FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY.

RAUL, BACK TO YOU ON THAT, AND WHILE HIS FAMILY CLEARLY, AS THE PRIMARY FOCUS IS MISSING A FATHER, A HUSBAND TODAY, YOU GUYS ARE MISSING A BROTHER, AS YOU POINT OUT. AND YOU ALSO -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT, I THINK IT CAN THE SOMETIMES BE OVERHOOK ARED, THE RISKS THAT YOU GUYS RUN, AS YOU SAID, IN GOING AND DOING THAT JOB EVERY DAY. WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU TO SEE THE LOSS OF RAUL AND AS YOU GUYS, AGAIN, PUT YOUR LIVES ON THE LINE EVERY DAY. WHAT IS THE MINDSET GOING FORWARD?  THAT RHINO WOULD WANT US TO KEEP ON. WE KNOW HIM AS RHINO, SO WE'RE GOING TO REFER TO HIM AS RHINO, THAT HE WOULD BE UPSET IF WE GIVE UP DOING WHAT WE DO, BECAUSE HE LOVED IT. AND A DAY THAT HE WASN'T ON THAT ATV, YOU'D RUIN HIS CAY. -- HIS DAY. ONE THING HE LOVED WAS TO HEAR HIS NAME, RHINO, OTHER THE RADIO. SO HE REACHED OUT, OTHER AGENCIES WERE WORKING WITH US, AND THEY'D HEAR HIS VOICE HAVE, THEY NEVER KNEW WHERE HE WAS, BECAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST ONE ON THE RADIO AND THE LAST ONE YOU'D HEAR WHEN EVERYBODY WAS SAY, BUT HE ALWAYS HAD TO BE THERE CRACKING YOU UP. AND WE FIND IRONIC THAT WE'RE LIVE HERE AND SHARING HIS MEMORIES AND WE'RE MENTIONING RHINO, BECAUSE IF HE WAS HERE, HE'D BE LAUGHING. HE'D BE, LIKE, DID YOU HEAR THAT? THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ME ON NATIONAL T. NOW -- NATIONAL TV. NOW EVERYBODY KNOWS ME. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE. WILL: NO, WE APPRECIATE IT, SHARING MORE COLOR ON WHO RAUL GONZALEZ WAS. AND ALTHOUGH IT'S A SAD OCCASION AND WE ALL SIT HERE TODAY AND HONOR HIS LIFE, I'M ALSO GLAD THAT YOU COULD BRING SOME HUMOR TO THE FACT THAT HE WOULD APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT HIM. AND HIS HONOR AND HIS SACRIFICE FOR IN THIS COUNTRY. THE THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING WITH US THIS MORNING.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU, WILL. WILL: RAUL GONZALEZ LEAVES BEHIND HIS FAMILY INCLUDING HIS TWO CHILDREN. OF HE WAS 38 YEARS OLD. MAY HE REST IN PEACE. PETE: WE'RE BACK WITH A FOX NEWS ALERT, PART THREE OF THE TWITTER FILE IFS REVEALING EXECUTIVES MET WITH THE FBI AND DHS AND DNI ON A WEEKLY BASIS AROUND THE 2020 ELECTION. LAOS LEAST WEEKLY BASIS IS. IN A SERIES OF TWEETS, MATT TAIBBI WRITE NICK NICHOLS IS ASKED IF THE MARKETING DEPARTMENT SHOULD SAY TWITTER REPORTS MISINFORMATION WITH OUTSIDE EXPERTS. WILL: PICKLES TOLD THEM TO SAY PARTNERSHIPS, NOT SURE WE DESCRIBE THE DHS AND FBI AS EXPERTS, IT READS, QUOTE. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOME WAY TO CHARACTERIZE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, AND UNFILTERED'S DAN BONN GEE GLOW IS A GREAT -- BONGINO. YOU WERE ONE OF THE PEOPLE PLACED ON TWITTER'S BLACKLIST TO THEIR SEARCH ENGINE. GOOD MORNING, DAN. HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THAT RELATIONSHIP?  LISTEN, THIS IS ONLY THE BIGGEST FIRST AMENDMENT SCANDAL OF MY LIFETIMEMENT YOU KNOW, I JUST TURNED 48 NOT THAT LONG AGO. I'VE NEVER SEEN -- AND HERE'S THE CRAZY THING, GUYS, IT'S SO EASY TO EXPLAIN THAT IT'S HILARIOUS WATCHING LIBERAL MEDIA ACTIVISTS, YOU KNOW, WET THEIR DIAPERS TRYING TO DEFEND THIS. FIRST, REMEMBER THE STORY OVER THE TWITTER GOVERNMENT COLLUSION TO SUPPRESS PEOPLE LIKE ME AND SHADOW BAN ME? THE FIRST STORY WAS, WELK LISTEN, IT'S A PRIVATE COMPANY, THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT. AND THEN WE FOUND OUT THAT THERE WAS GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT, THAT THE FBI MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED. AND THEN WE WERE CONFIRMED THAT THE FBI WAS INVOLVED, AND THEN THEY WERE LIKE, WELL, THE FBI WAS JUST GIVING GENERAL WARNINGS TO TECH COMPANY. AND THEN IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS FBI AND THE DNI AND THE DHS AND POTENTIALLY THE CDC AND OTHERS. AND THEN THEY WERE LIKE, OKAY, IT WAS JUST A LOT OF GENERAL VOICE FROM THE GOVERNMENT. AND THEN -- SORRY, ONE MORE -- THEN THE STORY MORPHED AGAIN. THE TWITTER THE EXECUTIVE'S SWORN STATEMENT TO THE FEC CAME OUT WHERE HE ADMITTED THAT IT WASN'T A GENERAL WARNING, BUT THAT THESE ENTITIES HAD WARNED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE HUNTER BIDEN STORY. AND NOW IF ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY'RE, LIKE, WELL, SCREW IT, WE'RE JUST COMMIES, LET'S JUST ADMIT IT AND CUT THE B.S -- [LAUGHTER] I MEAN, REALLY. GUYS, CAN ANYONE ON THE COUCH, I KNOW YOU'RE ALL STRONG, LIBERTY-LOVING PATRIOTS. CAN ANYONE EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THE FBI, THE DNI AND THE DHS MEETING WITH A PRIVATE COMPANY AND WINKING AND NODDING, SUGGESTING THEY'D RESTRICT PEOPLE'S FREE SPEECH, CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THAT'S NOT A VIOLATION OF THE FIRST A AMENDMENT? I'M ALL EARS, MAN. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE WE'RE EVEN HAVING DEBATE. LISA: WELL, THE MEDIA'S IGNORING IT OUTSIDE OF US. WE'RE COVERING IT, BUT THE MEDIA'S IGNORING IT. HOW DEEP DO YOU THINK THIS GOES, DAN?  WELL, LISTEN, THIS IS THE NEXT SHOE TO DROP HERE. SO ON MY SHOW TONIGHT I HAVE AN \"UNFILTERED,\" IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AN 8-MINUTE MONOLOGUE, I HI PETE MAY HAVE HEARD SOME OF IT, IT TURNED INTO, LIKE, A 13-MINUTE MONOLOGUE. IT'S COMPLETELY UNSCRIPTED, AND IT REALLY SCREWED UP MY WHOLE SHOW BECAUSE WE HAD TO CANCEL SOME GUESTS. I PRODUCE THE RECEIPTS AND THE FACTS TO TONIGHT. IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY COLLUDED WITH THE GOVERNMENT TO RESTRICT FREE SPEECH. WE KNOW THAT. WE'RE NOT ARGUING ABOUT THAT, MEDIA IMBECILES, YOU GUYS ARE JUST USELESS ANYWAY, WE'LL TAKE THIS FROM HERE. THE NEXT SHOE TO DROP IS WERE THESE TECH COMPANIES COLLUDING WITH EACH OTHER. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY I BRING THIS UP, AND I PRODUCE THE REAMENDMENT TOES TONIGHT ON MY SHOW -- RECEIPTS. I WAS ATTACKED, WELL, I DON'T WANT TO BE DRAMATIC. I WAS CONFRONTED BY A LOT OF THESE TECH COMPANIES, LET'S SAY, ALL AROUND THE SAME TIME ON MY PODCAST AND EVERYWHERE ELSE. AND THEY ALL SEEMED TO HAVE THE SAME MESSAGE. NOW, I CAN'T PROVE THEY WERE COLLUDING WITH EACH OTHER, BUT I'LL SHOW YOU TONIGHT HOW GOOGLE, HOW YouTUBE -- WHICH IS PART OF GOOGLE -- FACEBOOK AND TWITTER ALL IN THIS SAME TIME PERIOD ALL CAME AFTER LITTLE OLD DAN BONGINO FROM QUEENS. YouTUBE BANNED ME FOR SAYING THAT CLOTH MASKS DON'T STOP THE SPREAD OF COVID WHICH NOW, BY THE WAY, IS SCIENTIFIC FACT. GOOGLE ADS WIPE WHOD MY WEB SITE OFF THEIR -- WIPED MY WEB SITE OFF THEIR NETWORK. TWITTER SUSPENDED ME AFTER JANUARY 6TH FOR SIMPLY RETWEETING TRUMP'S STATEMENT. AND THEN FACEBOOK SAYS AT THE SAME TIME, OH, WE'RE GOING TO START THE CRUSHING POLITICAL CONTENT, AND WHO IS IT GOING TO AFFECT? I EVEN SHOW YOU THE NEWS MEDIA, IT SAYS BEN SHAPIRO AND DAN BONGINO BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BIGGEST FACEBOOK PAGES IN THE CONSERVATIVE SPACE. WERE THEY COLLUDING WITH EACH OTHER? I THINK THEY WERE. PETE: GO AHEAD. WILL: IF I COULD, I WAS THINKING ABOUT DAN'S QUESTION TO US, AND I WANTED TO, OF HOW THEY SAY NOT A FIRST AMENDMENT VIOLATION. LIKE YOU, DAN, I LOVE DEBATING. THAT MEANS I SEEK OUT THE OTHER SIDE. HOW ARE THEY SAYING IT, INCREASING HI IN THIS -- INCREASINGLY IN THIS STORY, HOW ARE THEY SPINNING IT. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THEY'RE SAYING OTHER THAN THAT IT'S A NOTHING BURGER, THEY'RE SAYING, WELL, THE FBI CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRIVATE COMPANY, THEY CAN MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS MISINFORMATION. AND THEN I THINK WE MOVE TO THE NEXT STEP WHICH IS IF ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS FLOW IN ONE DIRECTION, WHAT DOES THAT TELL US ABOUT OUR NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE APPARATUS, RIGHT? WHAT DOES THAT TELL US ABOUT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH WE INCREASINGLY FOCUS ON AND NEED TO AND THEIR POINT OF VIEW WHEN IT COMES TO SOMEONE LIKE YOU, SOMEBODY LIKE ME, SOMEBODY LIKE METE, LISA AND OUR -- PETE, LISA AND OUR POINTS OF VIEW?  YOU'RE A LAWYER, AND SO YOU PROBABLY GET THIS. I'M NOT, BUT I'M INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH HOW THE LAW WORKS HAVING SPENT MY CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE REASON WE HAVE JUDGES BECAUSE, AS YOU KNOW, WILL, THE LAW'S A LOT OF GRAY AREA. SO, YES, THEY COULD TECHNICALLY SAY, OH, WE JUST WINKED AND NODDED AND SAY, OH, THIS TWEET DAN BONGINO PUT OUT WILL THE ABOUT MASKS, THIS COULD BE CLASSIFIED AS MISINFORMATION. AND THEN THE FBI COULD SIT BACK AND SAY WE DIDN'T COMMAND ANYTHING AND PLAY A EUPHEMISMS GAME. BUT, WILL, NO JUDGE IS GOING TO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY. THERE'S AN IMPLIED FORCE MECHANISM WITH GOVERNMENT THAT DOESN'T EXIST WHEN A PRIVATE ENTITY DOES THAT. THE GOVERNMENT IS THE ONLY ENTITY IN THE UNITED STATES, IN OUR COUNTRY THAT HAS THE POWER TO TALK YOUR LIFE AND YOUR FREEDOM. WE DON'T HAVE MERCENARIES, WE DON'T HAVE PRIVATE POLICE THAT ARE DEPUTIZED BY THE GOVERNMENT. YOU MAY HAVE SOME KIND OF POLICE POWERS, BUT THE GOVERNMENT SANCTIONS THAT ALL THE. TIME. SO WHEN THE FBI MAKES A RECOMMENDATION,ST IT'S THE NOT A RECOMMENDATION. IT'S AN IMPLIED YOU BETTER DO THIS OR ELSE. AND ANY SERIOUS JUDGE KNOWS THAT. WILL: HEY, BY THE WAY, DAN, I'M SORRY, THIS WAS HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS WERE THREATENING BIG TECH. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?  YES, OPENLY. WILL: DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS WERE THREATENING BIG TECH WHILE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT ARMS WERE MAKING SUGGESTIONS.  WILL, I WAS, I WAS AN EARLY INVESTOR IN PARLER. AOC LITERALLY TWEETED OUT TO AMAZON ABOUT THEIR CLOUD WHICH PARLER WAS ON, HEY, AMAZON, WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO DO ABOUT PARLER? I MEAN, NOW TO THE LIBS, I KNOW YOU'RE NOT THAT BRIGHT FINISH. [LAUGHTER] BUT LET'S REVERSE THIS. LISA: I DON'T DISAGREE.  THEY'RE NOT. IMAGINE YOU HAD SAID TO THE PRO-ABORTION CROWD THAT THE FBI B WENT INTO A PRO-LIFE GROUP AND SAID, HEY, GUYS, WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING YOU BLOCK AN ABORTION CLINIC, BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DID IT, WE MAY NOT DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT SO, YOU KNOW, IF YOU GUYS GO AND BLOCK -- HELD LOSE THEIR MINDS, HELD LOSE THEIR MINDS. LISA: IT ALL ALWAYS GOES IN THE DIRECTION OF HURTING REPUBLICANS. PETE: IT'S DEMOCRATS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WITH A LOT OF POWER WENGING AND NODDING AT DEMOCRATS IN SAN FRANCISCO WITH POWER ALL FLOWING IN ONE PARTICULAR DIRECTION, AND HAY NEVER COUNTED ON ANY OF US KNOWING BECAUSE IT'S AN ELITE GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND A SILICON VALLEY COMPANY THAT WASN'T SUPPOSE TO BE TO BOUGHT BY ELON MUSK. DAN, REAL QUICK, ON YOUR SHOW TONIGHT WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?  PETE HEGSETH, CHARLIE KIRK, CHARLIE HURT, I'VE GOT A KILLER MONOLOGUE, AND PETE GETS TO JUDGE WHO DID IT BETTER IN KARAOKE, BRET BAIER OR HILLARY CLINTON. [LAUGHTER] WILL: THAT'LL BE GOOD. LISA: I SAW THE HILLARY CLINTON THING, AND I WILL NEVER -- YES. [LAUGHTER] DAN, I WANTED TO, LIKE, POUND MY HEAD AGAINST -- [LAUGHTER] IT WAS BAD -- AGAINST THE WALL. PETE: BRET BAIER HAS SURPRISING SKILLS. YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH HIM. LEAST LOIS DAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU. WILL: THANKS, BROTHER. PETE: KOMAING UP THIS CHRISTMAS -- COMING UP THIS CHRISTMAS, WE'RE BOEING TO INTRODUCE YOU TO THE THREE BUSINESSES WITH BRAG-WORTHY GIFTS ALL MADE IN THE USA. \u266a \u266a \u266a 20221210143948.668|20221210144321.780",

        "trs": "\u266a \u266a  WELCOME BACK. A RESTAURANT IN VIRGINIA REFUSED TO SERVE MEMBERS OF CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN GROUP OVER ITS VIEWS ON ABORTION AND TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE. THE FAMILY FOUNDATION SAYS IT SCHEDULED AN EVENT AT AT THE BAR AND CANCELED THEIR RESERVATION HOURS BEFORE THE EVENT PEER OF WAIT STAFF ADVISED ON THE GROUP'S BELIEF AND THEY DIDN'T WANT TO SERVE THEM. FOX NEWS DID REACH OUT TO THE RESTAURANT AND THIS IS WHAT THEY SENT US, \"WE ALWAYS REFUSED FOR ANYONE TO MAKE OUR STAFF UNCOMFORTABLE OR UNSAFE. OUR STAFF ARE PEOPLE WITH RIGHTS WHO DESERVE DIGNITY AND SAFE WORK ENVIRONMENT. THE PRESIDENT OF THE FAMILY FOUNDATION RESPONDED TO T \"THE FAULKNER FOCUS\" ON WEDNESDAY.  AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO HEAR WE ARE AT A POINT WE ARE SO DIVIDED ON THINGS LIKE FAITH AND VIEWS ON ISSUES THAT WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE EATING AND DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS PEER THAT IS NOT AMERICA. THAT IS NOT THE FREEDOM AND THAT IS NOT STABILITY.  WHO WANTS TO RESPOND TO THIS FIRST COME I WILL COME BACK TO YOU, TOMI.  Tomi: LET'S SAY THIS WAS ANOTHER GROUP. IF YOU -- THAT IS WHAT BOTHERS ME AND LIBERAL INTOLERANCE, WE HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE, A DOUBLE STANDARD. WE'VE NEVER SETTING THAT BEFORE. BUT I WILL SAY, I WISH THERE WAS CONSISTENCY HOW WE DISCUSSED THE ISSUE. OUT OF ONE SIDE OF OUR MALLS, YOU CAN'T SAY YOU NEED TO BAKE CAKES FOR LGBQT COUPLES BUT THEN HE PEOPLE OUT OR YOUR RESTAURANT IF PRO-LIFE BUT THEN REPUBLICANS, CONSERVATIVES WE CAN'T DO THAT EITHER. THERE HAS TO BE CONSISTENCY ON IT. YOU WANT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND PEOPLE TO DENY SERVICE OR NOT? WE HAVE TO GET ON SAME PAGE. AGAIN THE COME I HAVE A FEELING A LOT OF LIBERAL CITIES WILL HAVE A LOT OF LIBERAL EMPLOYEES THAT PROBABLY DON'T WANT TO SERVE CONSERVATIVES IN GENERAL PEER THAT IS A TESTAMENT TO HOW DIVIDED WE ARE IN THE COUNTRY. I WISH WE COULD GET ALONG AND NOT TALK ABOUT POLITICS ALL THE TIME IN A RESTAURANT HERE THAT WOULD BE NICE BUT WE DO HAVE TO HAVE CONSISTENCY.  SEAN, WINDOWS GOVERNMENT GET INVOLVED? IF YOU OWN A RESTAURANT AND PRO-ABORTION GROUP AND WILLING TO STAND ON THAT.  Sean: I AGREE WITH THE POINT WE HAVE TO HAVE CONSISTENCY BUT THE LARGER THEME HERE IS THAT CHRISTIANITY IS BECOMING OFFENSIVE TO A LOT OF AMERICANS. SO YOU LOOK AT KIRK CAMERON STORY AND THE BOOKS ABOUT BIBLICAL FAITH ISSUES AND LIBRARIES KEPT HIM OUT OF DOING A STORY HOUR. HOWEVER, THEY LET DRAG QUEEN STORY HOURS COME INTO THE LIBRARY HERE THERE IS AN ISSUE UP FRONT AND WAR ON CHRISTIANS IN AMERICA SAYING THEY ARE INTOLERANT. WE DON'T WANT THEM IN OUR PLACE OF BUSINESS PEER THAT IS CONCERNING TO ME AND I LEARNED THIS LONG TIME AGO, THE REAL WORLD RACHEL MTV AND, WE ARE SO TOLERANT. THEY ARE THE MOST INTOLERANT PEOPLE YOU WILL EVER MEET. CONSERVATIVES MELISSA AND I WILL DO ALL THE LIBERAL THINGS AND PARTICIPATE IN YOUR LIBERAL SHOWS. THEY HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR US.  YOU JUST WROTE A BOOK \"FAITH STILL MOVES MOUNTAINS\" TO THIS DATE AND AGE AND WHEN IT COMES TO RELIGION, WHY IS IT ALWAYS CHRISTIANS T THE ONE THAT GET BANNED FROM EVERYTHING? IS THERE ANOTHER RELIGION AND WHERE WERE THE WO COMMUNITY ON THAT?  Harris: IT IS REALLY INTERESTING AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS LAST HOUR. I HAVE THE PODCAST DOORS OF \"COFFEE & BIBLE TIME\" PODCAST ON AND WE ARE LEARNING THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE TO SAY THAT THEY ARE CHRISTIAN NOW HAS FALLEN TO 64%. IT HAS FALLEN BY 2070, FAR BELOW 40%. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHERE WE ARE BECOMING OUTNUMBERED AS CHRISTIANS. AND AGAIN, I SAY THIS WHOLEHEARTEDLY, WHEN YOU START TO TALK ABOUT THE TOPIC OF FAITH AND YOU REMIND PEOPLE THAT YOU LEAN INTO GOD, HE LEANS INTO YOU, IT IS A FIRE THAT BEGINS IN THEIR HEARTS. TO WANT TO BE WITH OTHERS WHO ARE ALSO SAYING THAT. TO GIVE A BOOK LIKE MINE AS A GIFT TO SAY, LET'S GET THE CONVERSATION STARTED PURE ITS WHITE BILL VERY BLESSED ABOUT THE JOURNEY FROM ABOUT BEING PART OF THE JOURNEY WITH PEOPLE. BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TOPIC PEER THAT IS WHAT IS DRIVING IT. IT IS ALSO IN THIS COUNTRY, WE HAD A LOT OF THINGS ABOUT OURSELVES. BUT WHO AMONG US DOESN'T KNOW SOMEBODY WHO CHEATED ON THEIR SPOUSE OR HAD TOO MUCH TO DRINK, PUBLIC INTOXICATED AND TMI. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO FOUNDATIONAL SUCCESS, THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THEIR FAITH. UNDERSTANDABLY, BECAUSE WE ARE CRITICIZED FOR IT. VICTORIA, THE PRESIDENT OF THE FAMILY FOUNDATION SAID, LOOK, WHAT THEY DID WAS ACTUALLY ILLEGAL. YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE IN THAT WAY BEING IN A RESTAURANT BASED ON PEOPLE'S BELIEFS. PEOPLE COME UP THEY THINK. NO SHIRT, NO SERVICE IS NOT YOU CAN'T PRAY OVER YOUR MEAL WHEN YOU GET HERE. RIGHT? THAT IS NOT IN THE SAME CATEGORY. THEY TREAT TOLERANCE BUT NOT TOLERANT OF CHRISTIAN AS A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE. SPEAK WITH NEED A NEW P.R. PERSON, THAT STATEMENT UNSAFE AND UNCOMFORTABLE. WHO WROTE THAT, I'M SORRY A FAITH-BASED GROUP, NUMBER ONE. THEN MAYBE HE NEEDS TO HIRE A P.R.  WHERE WILL THIS GO, THE COURTS. IT IS GOING IN SEVERAL INSTANCES NOW. THERE WERE CASES HEADING TO THE SUPREME COURT ALREADY IF THE SUPREME COURT. I'M A BUSINESS AND I WILL DENY SOMEBODY SURFACE. OR I WILL SAY YES OR NO IN A LIVE THAT IS GOING, THAT IS WHAT LAWYERS ARE JUMPING ON.  YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN A GROUP WILL CALL THE RESTAURANT NOT TOLD HIM THE NAME OF THE GROUP BECAUSE THEY WILL BE TOO SCARED THEY WILL BE TURNED AWAY. THAT IS HOW THE CHRISTIANS HAVE TO OPERATE. YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.  Sean: BUT THEY CAN'T KEEP THEIR MOUTH SHUT SPIRIT YOU HAVE TO LEAN INTO YOUR FAITH. IF YOU DO IT, HARRIS, I'M A CHRISTIAN.  EASIER SAID THAN DONE, SEAN. LOOK AT THE TEACHERS AND FAIRFAX COUNTY AND WE ARE TOLD TO TEACH A CERTAIN THING BUT WE ARE TOO SCARED TO THINK AB SPEAK ABOUT IT AND THAT WE WILL LOSE OUR JOBS. COMING UP IN CASE YOU MISSED IT IS NEXT. \u266a \u266a tandards. 20221209174317.210|20221209174549.861",

        "trs": " Tucker: IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF SEMIFOR. THAT'S NOT SURPRISING. FEW LITTLE OFFING AMERICANS HAVE HEARD OF SEMI. IFOR OTHER THAN RICHPEOPLE WHO . $257 MILLION WERE RAISED BY SIX INVESTORS. TWO OF THE SIX, THE BIGGEST ONES HAVE THE SAME LAST NAME. BANKMANFREED AS? SAM AND HIS BROTHER. THEY PAID OFF MEDIA OUTLET'S FOR PHONE-IN COVERAGE. WHAT HE GOT. NOW THAT SAM HAS BEEN EXPOSED AS A BILLION DOLLAR SCAM ARTIST THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR BEN SMITH AND SEMAFOR. YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO KEEP THE PROCEEDS OF OTHER PEOPLES CRIMES. WE REACHED OUT TO SMITH TO SEE WHO THEY WOULD RETURN THE MONIES. BEN SMITH COULD DO THE RIGHT THING AND HELP WITH THE MONEY HE GOT FROM A SCAM ARTIST. WILL HE DO THAT? OF COURSE NOT. SEMAFOR POINTED US TO A STATEMENT SAYING THEY'RE NOT RETURNING A DOLLAR UNTIL THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION MAKES THEM. WHEN WILL THAT BE? COME ON. SAM BANKMANFREED WAS THE SECOND BIGGEST DONOR TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. IN THE END WE HEAR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS LOOKING INTO HIM. HE WILL GET AWAY WITH IT, BEN SMITH WILL GET AWAY WITH IT, SEMAFOR WILL GET AWAY WITH IT. IT'S NOT AN APPEALING WEBSITE AND LIKELY WON'T BE AROUND TOO LONG. OUR FRIEND IN DETROIT WENT DOWN TO THE CERTAIN BOARD TORE SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. HE SHOT REMARKABLE VIDEO IN THE PROCESS. HE SHOT THIS IN MEXICO SHOWING HOW EASY IT IS FOR ILLEGALS TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES WITH NO INTERVENTION FROM OUR NATIONAL GUARD. WATCH THIS.  A OFFICIAL TRIES TO STOP US. HE HAS NO POWER.  HE SAYS THAT IS NOT CORRECT. THAT IS TRUE. NOTHING IS CORRECT HERE. ABOUT TWO THOUSAND MIGRANTS CROSS IN THIS SECTOR EVERY DAY OF EVERY WEEK. NOW WITH THE EXPIRATION OF TITLE FORTY TWO, THE COVID POLICY OF RETURNING A SIGH LEM SEEKERS TO MEXICO WILL EXPIRE. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE EXPECTED TO FLOOD THE BANKS. ASYLUM SEEKERS LIKE ELVIS ONLY NEEDS TO TOUCH AMERICAN TOIL. BEFORE HE CAN GATHER HIS BEARINGS HERE THE TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD ARE WAITING FOR HIM TO SHUTTLE HIM TO HIS NEW LIFE.  Tucker: SO YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHY HAS NOB DONE WHAT CHARLIE HAS DONE LIKE HE JUST DID. HE IS HOST OF THE NO BS NEWS HOUR. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON AND DOING THIS. I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYONE DO THIS BEFORE. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?  I DON'T KNOW, MAN. THAT'S WHY I WENT DOWN THIS. THE WAY I LOOK AT THE COVERAGE IT'S THE EGGHEADS AND THE MEAT HEADS. VERY WITH NO IDEA REALLY WHAT IT'S LIVING OR WHAT THE ANSWER MIGHT BE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.  Tucker: WHAT WAS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF IT?  IT'S A DAMN MESS. LIKE ON THE LEFT, THEY'RE SAYING YOU KNOW WAR TORN. THESE ARE ASYLUM SPEAKERS. THEY'RE JUST BROKE PEOPLE LOOKING FOR A BETTER LIFE. THAT'S THE TRUTH. ON THE OTHER HAND THE RIGHT BUILD THE WALL. THAT'S DUMB. LISTEN TO ME PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TUCK LETTER POST IT. FIND THE WHOLE STORY. IF YOU TOUCH AMERICAN SOIL YOU GET ASYLUM. SO WHEN THE WALL IS TWENTY FEET AWAY OR A QUARTER MILE IN IT DOESN'T MATTER. IT WON'T STOP ANYTHING. LET'S DO A LITTLE EXPERIMENT. UP HERE, I'M IN A BORDER TOWN DETROIT WITH CANADA. SAY DESANTOS YOU WANT TO PACK A BUS FULL OF MIGRANTS. TELL THEM, PLEASE, DON'T LIE TELL THEM THEY ARE GOING TO CANADA TO GET ASYLUM. YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN, TUCKER? CANADA WILL TURN THEM AROUND. BECAUSE WE HAVE A TREATY WITH CANADA. WHEREVER AN ASYLUM SEEKER FIRST TOUCHES, THAT IS WHERE THEY APPLY FOR ASYLUM. WHY DON'T WE HAVE THIS WITH MEXICO. THIS IS WHAT THE PIN HEADS IN WASHINGTON NEED TO BE DOING. THERE IS ONLY ONE BORDER STATE SENATOR ON THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE, TED CRUZ. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE HELL TED CRUZ IS.  Tucker: YOU MAKE A REALLY SMART POINT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS EVERYONE COME AGO CROSS IS NOT FROM MEXICO. THESE ARE PEOPLE CO COMING FROM CENTRAL AMERICA, AFRICA OR THE MIDDLE EAST. WAS THAT YOUR EXPERIENCE?  A HUNDRED PERCENT. RUSSIANS, ROMANIANS, PER YOU'VIANS, HAITIANS, GHANA, YOU NAME IT. THEY ARE COMING. HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING. WHEN TRUMP WAS IN OFFICE HE NEGOTIATED THE REMAIN IN MEXICO POLICY AS THE PRESIDENT IS ALLOWED TO DO. YOU SEEK ASYLUM YOU REMAIN IN MEXICO UNTIL YOUR COURT DATE. BIDE HE'S FIRST DAY IN OFFICE HE SAID HE'S SUSPENDING IT. THEY HEAR AROUND THE WORLD AMNESTY. THEY'RE LINING UP IN MEXICO. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY HEAR, AMNESTY. YOU TALK ABOUT DA CA PEOPLE I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THEM THEY GREW UP HERE. HE SAYS AMNESTY THE WHOLE WORLD FLOODS IN, DUDE. FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRLS. I FOUND A VACCINATION PILL. SHE GOT A BIRTH CONTROL IMPLANT IN HER ARM A MONTH AGO. WHY BECAUSE SHE'S AFRAID TO BE RAPED AND GET PREGNANT THERE. IS A BETTER WAY TO CONTROL THE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE OTHER THAN A DAMN BUM RUSH. I CAME INTO MEXICO TWENTY YEARS AGO WITH THE S SINA LOA CARTEL. WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE APPREHENDED. NOW IT'S DIFFERENT. EVERYONE WANTS TO BE APPREHENDED. I WOULD DO IT TOO. A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE, HUNGRY PEOPLE. THE GOVERNMENT MUST MANAGE THE FRO OF HUMAN BEINGS THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO WE THE PEOPLE AND THEY'RE NOT DOING A DAMN THING.  Tucker: IT'S AMAZING. BILL IS THE ONLY OTHER PERSON DOING REPORTING LIKE THIS. I'M THANKFUL YOU. HAVE CHARLIE, THANK YOU.  THANKS, MAN. POST THAT THING SOMEWHERE, WILL YOU.  Tucker: SURE WE WILL. SO THERE IS A NATION WIDE SHORTAGE OF BASIC ANTIBIOTICS. WHY? MANY ARE MADE IN CHINA. WHY IS THAT? WE HAVE DETAILS AFTER THE BREAK.  Tucker: WE HATE TO KEEPING BAD FUSE BUT THERE IS A NATION WIDE SHORT AM OF BASIC ANTIBIOTICS AND SUPPOSEDLY TAMAFLU AND OTHERS FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS. THE FDA IS REPORTING 180 DRUG SHORT APLGZ. MANY REQUIRE INGREDIENTS THAT COME FROM CHINA. IT MIGHT BE TIME TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.  TUCKER, GOOD TO BE WITH YOU TONIGHT. DON'T THINK THE FDA IS ACTUALLY DOING ANYTHING. THEY'RE SITTING LIMB LY BY. THE STORY BEGINS AND END IN CHINA TONIGHT BECAUSE OF THE LOCK DOWNS, RIDICULOUS LOCK DOWNS CUTTING OFF THE SUPPLY CHAIN. ACCORDING TO U.S. CENSUS WE GET 95% OF YOU MEAN PORTED IBUPROFEN FROM CHINA. AND MOST OF OUR TYLENOL AND ANTIBIOTICS. WHAT HAS HAPPENED? THEY RELIEVE LOCK DOWNS AND PEOPLE ARE SCRAMBLING TO THE PHARMACIES TRYING TO FIND TYLENOL AND MOE TREUPB. WE WON'T GET IT. THEY'RE HOARDING IT THERE. PANIC BUYING BECAUSE OF THE PILL POPPING SITUATION AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL CULTURE AROUND THE WORLD. HERE WE ARE IN THE UNITED STATES. IN UTAH THEY REPORT NOBODY CAN FIND LIQUID IBUPROFEN, LIKE MOTRIN. NIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE COMING FROM CHINA. I KNOW WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT PHARMACEUTICALS. AGREE WITH YOU, TUCKER. WE'RE A PILL-POPPING CULTURE. A PARENT GOES TO THE PHARMACY. CAN'T GET A TYLENOL. THEY RUSH THE CHILD TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM UNNECESSARILY. THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE TALK ING ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME NOW. I THINK THAT'S A HUGE PART OF THE PROBLEM. FEAR DRIVEN PILLS TO ASSUAGE YOURSELF YOU'RE DOING SOMETHING. LOOK WHERE THIS IS COMING FROM. SUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS FROM TKHAOEUPB AFPLT CHINA THE SAME COUNTRY THAT EXPORTS THE INFLUENZA VIRUS EVERY YEAR. EXPORTED COVID TO US. NOW WE CAN'T GO TO THEM FOR THE PILLS WE TREAT THE COMMON COLD OR THE ANTIBIOTICS WE NEED. THE PROBLEM STARTS AND BEGINS WITH CHINA, TUCKER.  Tucker: CAN I ASK YOU A QUICK QUESTION, DOCTOR. HOW HARD IS IT TO MAKE THESE IN THE UNITED STATES?  SIMPLE. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT YOU KNOW WHY? IT'S GENERIC AND DON'T MAKE A PROFIT ON IT. DRUG MANUFACTURES DON'T FEEL THEY CAN DO IT. THE GOVERNMENT SITS BY. WE SHOULD MAKE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE INGREDIENTS IN THE UNITED STATES. IT'S CALDERON ACTIVE FARM SUIT AL INGREDIENTS. WE GET THEM FROM CHINA AND INDIA. WE NEED TO MAKE IT HERE. THAT'S A GREAT POINT.  Tucker: GREAT POINT. DR. MARK SEAGULL, GREAT TO ZOO YOU TONIGHT. THE FBI HAS HAD HUNTER BIDEN'S LAP TOP FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS. ON THAT IS INFORMATION ABOUT CRIMES. HUNTER BIDEN HAS NOT BEEN CHARGED BY FEDERAL AUTHORITIES OR RAIDED EITHER. HE DIDN'T PRAY AT AN ABORTION CLINIC. BASICALLY EVERYONE INVESTIGATING THE CONTENTS OF THE LAP TOP ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE DOJ. WE LOOK INTO THE BIDEN'S EFFORTS TO CRUSH THIS STORY. HERE IS PART OF IT.  Tucker: NEARLY EVERYONE INVOLVED IN INVESTIGATING HUNTER'S BUSINESS PRACTICES HAVE BEEN INVESTED, INDICTED OR RAIDED. RUDY GUILIANI HAD HIS HOME SEARCHED AND COMPUTER SEIZED BY THE FBI. TTHE FBI EXECUTED A SEARCH WARRANT AT THE HOME OF VICTORIA WHO WORKED WITH AOU RAINIANS TO UNCOVER MORE INFORMATION. OTHERS WHO HELPED RUDY GUILIANI INVESTIGATE HUNTER BIDEN WERE ARRESTED ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE CHACHACHACHARGES.  Tucker: ONCE AGAIN THAT DOCUMENTARY IS CALDERON \"BIDEN INC\" PARTS ONE AND TWO ARE AVAILABLE ON FOX NATION. YOU HAVE TO BE CONCERNED IF YOUR MILITARY BECOMES POLITICALIZED. THAT CAN'T HAPPEN IN A FREE COUNTRY. SOMEPLACE IT'S APPEARS TO BE. JUST HAPPENED FOR REAL TO A MOTHER IN NEW JERSEY. SHE JOINS US NEXT TO SHARE HER STORY. PLUS PUBLIC LIBRARIES REFUSING TO ALLOW KIRK CAMERON TO READ HIS CHILDREN'S BOOK, BECAUSE IT'S TOO WHOLESOME FOR A LIBRARY. HE JOINS US STRAIGHT AHEAD.  Tucker: SO A FEW DAYS AGO A MOTHER IN NEW JERSEY, ANGELA REDDING, FOUND OUT HER CHILD'S ELEMENT ROO SCHOOL WAS ADVERTISING SOMETHING CALDERON PAN SEX AOU ALT. SHE THOUGHT IT WAS MUCH AND COMPLAINED ABOUT IT ON FACEBOOK. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY. WE ONLY KNOW ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF CHAOS IN CONTROL THAT BROKE THE STORY. IN RESPONSE TO ANGELA REDDING'S POST OUT OF THE BLUE AN ARMY OFFICER CALDERON ANGELA REDDING AN EXTREMIST ON FACEBOOK. HE THEN WROTE ON FACE BOOK THE QUOTE. JOINT BASED LEADERSHIP HAVE SECURITY FORCES WORKING WITH MULTIPLE STATE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO MONITOR THE SITUATION. WHAT? SO THE MILITARY RESPONDED TO A MOM IN A ELEMENTARY SCHOOL COMPLAIN ING ABOUT THE SEXUALIZATION OF HER OWN CHILD? THAT'S WARRANTED A MILITARY RESPONSE UNDER JOE BIDEN? APPARENTLY IT DID. SHORTLY AFTER THE CHIEF OF THE NORTH HAFPB OVER POLICE DEPARTMENT PRESSURED REDDING TO DELETE HER FACEBOOK POST. LET THAT SINK IN. THE POLICE AND MILITARY GOT INVOLVED BECAUSE THE MOM WROTE SOMETHING ON FACEBOOK THEY DIDN'T LIKING. TODAY IT WAS CONFIRMED TO THE SHOW, THEY NOTIFIED LAW ENFORCEMENT ABOUT THE EXCHANGE, COMMON INFORMATION SHARING INFORMATION AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. WAIT A SECOND, A MILITARY BASE IS NOT A \"LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY\" THEY ARE TO DEFEND US AGAINST FOREIGN ENEMIES NOT POLICE FACEBOOK POSTS. THIS IS MIND BOGGLING AND WE PRAY SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING ABOUT IT. ANGELA JOINS US TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR BEING BRAVE ENOUGH TO COME THIS. WERE YOU SURPRISED THE MILITARY WEIGHED IN ON YOUR FACEBOOK POST.  I WAS MORE THAN SURPRISED. I WAS SCARED. I PULLED MY KIDS FROM SCHOOL THE DAY I FOUND OUT. IT WAS MIND BOGGLING. WHEN THE U.S. MILITARY COMES AFTER YOU ABOUT RAISING CONCERN ON A PUBLIC POSTER AVAILABLE FOR ALL TO SEE. IT'S BIND BOGGLING.  TO BE CLEAR YOU WERE NOT THREATENING WAR, OR NUCLEAR WEAPONS AGAINST THE SCHOOL, CORRECT.  ACTUALLY MY POST WAS MODERATE. IT SAID I DIDN'T THINK MY 7-YEAR-OLD WAS, IT WAS AGE APPROPRIATE. I SAID ALL PEOPLE ARE DESERVING OF LOVE AND RESPECT. MY POST WAS EXPLICIT ABOUT THAT. IT STILL PROMPTED THIS RESPONSE. IT'S REALLY SCARY IN THIS COUNTRY WE CAN'T HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK AND RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. >  Tucker: YOU LIVE IN AN AREA WITH A LOT OF MILITARY FAMILIES. YOUR CHILDREN'S SCHOOL HAS A LOT OF MILITARY FAMILIES. YOU RESPECT THE MILITARY. ALMOST ALL AMERICANS DO. DO YOU KNOW THEY READ YOUR FACEBOOK POSTS.  I DID NOT. I WANT TO BE EXPLICIT. I BELIEVE OUR MILITARY PERSONNEL DESERVE THE UPMOST LOVE AND RESPECT. I'M THE DAUGHTER OF A VETERAN. I LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WITH MILITARY. THESE ARE PHENOMENAL FAMILIES. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS PHENOMENAL. THE TEACHERS IN OUR DISTRICT ARE PHENOMENAL. I THINK IT A ROLL ROUGE, BAD FACED ACTOR AND WE DON'T NEED TO IMPLICATE THE ENTIRE POPULATION. I DID NOT THINK THE MILITARY WAS MONITORING MOM'S FACEBOOK POSTS. NO, I DID NOT.  Tucker: NO, YOU WOULD HOPE COMMANDER SCHILLING WOULD BE REMOVED FROM HIS COMMAND TONIGHT. WE WILL SEE IF HE IS. WHAT WAS THE ROLL OF THE POLICE CHIEF, CAN YOU TELL US QUICKLY?  YES, I ACTUALLY GOT A CALL FROM THE ADMIN OF THE FACEBOOK GROUP THIS. IS RIDICULOUS TO TALK ABOUT THIS. THIS IS A PARENT'S GROUP I POSTED ON. I GOT A CALL FROM HER SAYING THE POLICE CHIEF CONTACTED HER SAYING MY POST SHOULD COME DOWN. SHE SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK. I SAID I DON'T WANT HOMELAND SECURITY COMING AFTER ME. TAKE THE POST DOWN. I DON'T WANT TO DEAL WITH THIS. I AGREED THE POST SHOULD COME DOWN. I CONTACTED THE POLICE CHIEF DIRECTLY AND REMINDED HIM OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THAT WE SHOULDN'T UTILIZE GOVERNMENT RESOURCES IN OUR POSITIONS TO PRESSURE INDIVIDUALS TO TAKE DOWN FACEBOOK POSTS. I ALSO SHARED WITH HIM THE POST I HAD SEEN. THERE WAS NOTHING WRONG. IT DIDN'T VIOLATE ANY LAW OR FACEBOOK RULE WHATSOEVER. SO, THAT IS HOW THAT ALL HAPPENED. YOU KNOW WE'RE HERE TODAY.  Tucker: I HOPE CHIEF HUFF IS RELIEVED OF HIS POST IMMEDIATELY TOO. I HAVEN'T HEARD OF THIS. I HOPE I DON'T AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR TELLING US ABOUT IT, ANGELA REDDING. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THANK YOU.  Tucker: SAY YOU WANT TO HOST A DRAG TIME STORY HOUR WITH SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS. YOU CAN USE YOUR PUBLIC LIBRARY ABOUT THAT BUT YOU CAN'T READ A BOOK ABOUT GOD AT A PUBLIC LIBRARY. THE ACTOR KIRK CAMERON JUST LEARNED THAT. WHEN RHODE ISLAND LIBRARY SAID WE'RE A FRIENDLY QUEER FRIENDLY LIBRARY AND OUR MESSAGING DOES NOT ALIGN. KIRK, SKWROEUPGZ US. JOINS US TONIGHT.KIRK, THANK YO. THIS HAS BEEN BANNED IN LINE RARE HE'S. HOW CONTROVERSIAL IS THIS?  IT TEACHES BIBLICAL WISDOM THROUGH LIFE WITH KIND, JOY, LOVE, PATIENCE AND SELF-CONTROL. I WANTED TO DO A BOOK READING AT A PUBLIC LIBRARY. I WAS DENIED BY OVER 50 WHO HOSTED DRAG QUEEN STORY HOURS. ONE OF THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS WAS ALAMEDA COUNTY LIBRARY. THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T WANT THE BOOK TEACHING BIBLICAL VALUES WHILE AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE HOETING A GENDER NAME-CHANGE CLINIC TOMORROW. WOW, IF WE'RE COMMITTED TO DIVERSITY WHY AM I EXCLUDED. WHY CAN'T I USE THE FACILITY TO READ MY BOOK. YOU'RE A LIBRARY.  Tucker: YES. WE BEGAN THE SHOW WITH UKRAINIAN'S PRESIDENT BANNING CHRISTIAN RELIGION. NOW WE ARE AT YOUR STORY, BANNING YOUR BOOK. THIS SEEMS TO BE FEAR OF CHRISTIANITY. WHY DO YOU THINK THIS IS SO SCARY?  WELL, MY UNDERSTANDING OF HISTORY IS THAT THE FAMILY AND THE CHURCH ARE TWO GREAT PILLARS OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION. THOSE TWO THINGS NEED TO BE REMOVED AND TAKEN OUT OF THE WAY IN ORDER TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE POWER STRUCTURE AND THE MORAL VALUE CODE OF THE NATION. THAT IS WHY PARENTS ARE FIGHTING BACK. TUCKER, HUNDREDS OF PARENTS AND LIBRARIANS ARE NOW E-MAILING US SAYING WE WANT YOUR BOOK. WE WANT TO HOST OUR OWN BRAVE BOOKSTOREY HOUR IN OUR PUBLIC LIBRARY. HERE IS MY CALL TO ACTION. I WANT EVERY PARENT AND GRANDPARENT IN AMERICA TO GET THEIR FAVORITE CHILDREN STORYBOOK OR A BOOK OF THE BIBLE. CALL THE LOCAL PUBLIC LIBRARY HOSTING A DRAG QUEEN STORY HOUR AND ASK FOR A CHANCE TO READ MY BOOK IN THE LIBRARY.   IF THEY SAY NO THEY'RE LIKELY BREAKING THE LAW AND VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION. THEY CAN CONTACT BRAVEBOOKS.COM. WE WILL GIVE THEM FREE BOOKS AND ALL THEY NEED TO TURN THE DENIAL INTO A REVIVAL IN THEIR COMMUNITY.  Tucker: I THINK THE POSTURE YOU'RE TAKING THAT IS GENTLE, CALM, BRAVE AND PERSISTENT. I CAN LEARN FROM. LET OUTRAGE. MORE RATIONAL RESPONSE. I THINK THAT REALLY WORKS. I HOPE YOU INSPIRE OTHER PEOPLE TO DO THE SAME. TELL YOUR STORY. DON'T BE MAD. BE HONEST. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, TUCKER. TWO CHRISTIANS PARTICULARLY WE ARE OFTEN TOLD NO IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE. WE GO HOME WITH OUR TAIL BETWEEN OUR LEGS IS IT AND WAITING FOR THE RAPTURE. INSTEAD OF GETTING ON THE OFFENSE AND SAY LET'S INVEST IN OUR CHILDREN AND TEACH THEM THE VALUES WE WANT THEM TO LEARN.  Tucker: AGREE. THE WAY YOU'RE DOING IT IS THE WAY TO DO IT. KIRK CAMERON, THANKS.  THANK YOU, TUCKER.  Tucker: MORE NEWS STRAIGHT AHEAD.  Tucker: WE ARE OUT OF TIME BUT BEFORE WE GO, ALONG WITH ICE CREAM AND BEETHOVEN, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" HAS DECLARED SHARK WEEK IS RACIST. \"WAX DIVERSITY.\" APPARENTLY NOT ENOUGH DIVERSITY AMONG A HOST OF SHARK WEEK. WE KNOW A GUY CALLED MIKE WHO HOSTED SHARK WEEK, MIKE ROWE. HE DISAGREES AND HE JOINS US TOMORROW NIGHT. [LAUGHS] WE'LL BE BACK TOMORROW NIGHT. 8:00 P.M.

        "trs": " Brian: THE REPORTER RESPONSIBLE FOR RELEASING THE TWITTER FILES REVEALING WHILE THE TROPIC WAS DELAYED. MATT TAIBBI TWEETING THIS TWITTER GENERAL COUNSEL AND FORMER FBI GENERAL COUNSEL JAMES BAKER. HE WAS FIRED AMONG THE REASONS VETTING THE FIRST BATCH THE TWITTER FILES WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF NEW MANAGEMENT. HERE TO WEIGH IN MEG OF JIM JORDAN. SOON TO BE CHAIRMAN OF THE FIDUCIARY COMMITTEE. JIM BAKER GOES TO TWITTER AND STILL THERE AND STILL HAS HIS HANDS ON THE SCALE HERE?  EVEN LAST WEEKEND I GUESS HE IS STILL LOOKING AT THE EMAILS THAT ARE GOING TO TAIBBI AND THAT ARE GOING OUT TO THE PUBLIC. SO TALK ABOUT THE FOX WATCHING THE HEN HOUSE HERE. I MEAN, COME ON. SO, REMEMBER, THIS GUY WAS OF THE CHIEF COUNSEL AT THE FBI 2016-2017 WHEN THEY WERE SPYING ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND THEN, OF COURSE, HE GOES TO TWITTER. AND HE IS THE COUNSEL WHO IS MAKING THE DECISION OH, IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THAT THE HUNTER BIDEN STORY JUST DAYS BEFORE THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION WE HAVE IT'S REASONABLE-TO-A ASSUME HE SAID, THAT THAT'S A HACK AND LEAK OPERATION FROM THE LUTION RUSSIANS. AND WHICH WE KNEW WASN'T. AND THEN, OF COURSE NOW HE IS DOING THIS OVER LAST WEEK AND OF COURSE HE WAS FIRED YESTERDAY. SO, I JUST -- THIS JUST SHOWS BIG TECH, BIG MEDIA, BIG GOVERNMENT WORKING TOGETHER TO KEEP INFORMATION FROM WE, THE PEOPLE. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. WHAT I'M COMMITTED TO DOING, WHAT THE MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTED TO DO IS GET INTO THE FBI'S ROLE IN ALL OF THIS. THOSE WEEKLY BRIEFINGS THEY WERE DOING WITH BIG TECH ON THE HEELS OF THAT LETTER FROM 451 FORMER ARE OFFICIALS WHO SAID IT WAS A RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION. BOLOGNA, THEY KNEW IT WAS BOLOGNA, YET THEY WERE DOING THESE BRIEFINGS, THAT'S THE BIG PROBLEM.  Brian: HE GOT FIRED. WHY WAS HE THERE TO BEGIN WITH. MUELLER ALL OVER THE MULLEN AND DURHAM REPORT AND IS HE A DISGRACE. WE ALL KNOW THAT EXCEPT FOR THE FBI AND MINNESOTA OF THE DEMOCRAT ORGANS TESTIMONY CNN AND MSNBC. WHY WEIGHS UP THERE UNTIL UNTIL SUNDAY AND WAS HE ABLE TO WORK WITH CYBER CONTACTS AND LEGAL KNOWLEDGE TO SOMEHOW SUPPRESS THINGS PERMANENTLY?  I MEAN, WE DON'T KNOW. WE HOPE NOT. WE WANT TO GET ALL THE FACTS OUT THERE BECAUSE THE MORE THE FACTS GET OUT THERE THE BETTER WE HAVE -- THE BETTER CHANCE WE HAVE OF MAKING SURE THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. BUT YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. THIS JIM BAKER IS ALL OVER EVERYTHING. IS HE THE ONE THAT SUSSMANN CAME TO INITIALLY ON THE FILE ALPHA BACK. HE KNEW SUSSMANN, HE WAS HILLARY CLINTON'S LAWYER HE IS ALL OVER THE DURHAM INVESTIGATION. THIS GUY HAS GOT CONNECTIONS THROUGHOUT THIS. WE WILL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT BARI WEISS AND OTHERS UNCOVER AND WHAT ELON MUSK CONTINUES TO RELEASE.  Brian: JIM, WHETHER THEY COME OUT, MATT TAIBBI SAYS HE DOESN'T SEE ANY GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT WITH THE TWITTER AND THE \"NEW YORK POST\" STORY AND THE ACCOUNT BEING FROZEN AND LAPTOP BEING LOOKED AT AS RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION. TO GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT. CAN YOU ECHO THAT?  I MEAN, MAYBE NOT DIRECT BUT WE WILL SEE. BUT, CERTAINLY INDIRECT, THEY ARE BRIEFING EVERYBODY ON -- WENT FROM, YOU KNOW, MONTHS TO EVERY WEEK THEY WERE DOING AND IN THE RUN UP TO THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTIONS WE HAVE. NEVER FORGET, THIS BRIAN, MY COLLEAGUE SAID IT BEST IN COMMITTEE A FEW MONTHS AGO, BUT WHEN IS THE FBI JUST GOING TO STAY OUT OF ELECTIONS? IN 2016 THEY SPIED ON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN. 2018 WAS THE MUELLER INVESTIGATION. 2020 THEY WERE DOING THESE BRIEFINGS TO SUPPRESS THE HUNTER BIDEN STORY THAT LED TO THE SUPPRESSION EVER THE HUNTER BIDEN STORY. 2022, 91 DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION, THEY RAID PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HOME. A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, THREE DAYS AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCES HE IS RUNNING FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2024 THEY NAME A SPECIAL COUNSEL WHO GOING TO HARASS HIM FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. MAYBE IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY JUST LET WE THE PEOPLE. LET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DECIDE WHO WE WANT TO BE PRESIDENT. WHO WE WANT REPRESENTING US IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS, JUST LET THE PEOPLE DECIDE, STAY OUT OF IT FOR GOODNESS SAKE.  Brian: REMEMBER, ERIC HOLDER, FAST AND FEWER USERS CAMPAIGN, PUTTING GUNS INTO MEXICO. WELL THE ATF IS SET TO DESTROY THOSE GUNS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OBAMA ERA FAST AND FURIOUS SCANDAL. ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?  HECK NO. AND I DOUBT THAT BRIAN TERRY'S FAMILY IS OKAY WITH IT, EITHER. I MEAN, REMEMBER WHAT THEY DID HERE, TOO. SOLD GUNS TO KNOWN STRAW PURCHASERS, THEY HAD THIS CRAZY IDEA WE ARE GOING TO TRACK GUNS AND FIGURE OUT THE BAD GUYS WHO ARE DOING. THIS WHAT WOUND UP HAPPENING IS BAD GUYS GOT AHOLD OF THOSE GUNS AND TERRY LOST HIS LIFE A BRAVE BORDER PATROL AGENT. THERE IS A CRIMINAL CASE GOING ON AS WE SPEAK IN MEXICO RELATED TO THIS CRAZY FAST AND FURIOUS IDEA THAT THE OBAMA-BIDEN ADMINISTRATION UNDERTOOK A FEW YEARS AGO. I THINK YOU CAN KEEP THE EVIDENCE JUST TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.  Brian: JIM JORDAN, THANKS SO MUCH. APPRECIATE IT?  YOU BET, THANK YOU.  Brian: GO OVER TO CARLEY SHIMKUS FOR THE OTHER BREAKING NEWS.  Carley: TENNESSEE POLICE STOPPING A ROBBERY FROM A NASHVILLE SHOPPING MALL ON SATURDAY. ONE JEWELRY STORE CLERK CALLING POLICE AFTER A MASKED ROBBER RANSACKED THE STORE STEALING DIAMONDS AND ESCAPING INTO A VAN. NOT BEFORE BEING SPOTTED BY AN UNDERCOVER POLICE OFFICER. ONE SUSPECT PEPPER SPRAYED AN EMPLOYEE WHILE ANOTHER FOUGHT AN OFFICER ATTEMPTING TO GRAB HIS GUN. FOUR SUSPECTS WERE ARRESTED. POLICE ARE STILL SEARCHING FOR THAT FIFTH REMAINING SUSPECT. THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION WAS FOUND GUILTY OF CRIMINAL TAX FRAUD IN NEW YORK YESTERDAY. THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S COMPANY CONVICTED ON 17 CHARGES, INCLUDING TAX FRAUD, FALSIFYING BUSINESS RECORDS, AND CONSPIRACY. TRUMP RELEASING A STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO THE CONVICTION THAT READS IN PART:  IT IS A CONTINUATION OF THE GREATEST POLITICAL WITCH-HUNT IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. NEW YORK CITY IS A HARD PLACE TO BE TRUMP AS BUSINESSES AND PEOPLE FLEE OUR ONCE GREAT CITY. LISTEN TO THIS A VIRGINIA RESTAURANT REFUSING TO CERTAIN A CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE GROUP OVER ITS VIEWS ON ABORTION AND TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE. THE FAMILY SCHEDULED EVENT AT METZGER BAR AND BUECHERY CANCELED BY THE RESTAURANT AN HOUR AND A HALF BEFORE RESTAURANT INSISTS ALWAYS PRIDED ITSELF BEING INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE TO DINE IN. THE RESTAURANT'S INTOLERANCE TOWARDS CERTAIN PEOPLE IS, QUOTE, DISGUSTING. THAT'S HOW THAT STORY IS SHAPING UP, JANICE. DOWNSTAIRS TO YOU.  Janice: VERY WARM TEMPERATURES FOR THE SOUTH AND GULF COAST ALL THE WAY UP TO THE EAST COAST. 56 NOW IN NEW YORK. THEN WE HAVE GOT THAT COLD AIR MOVING IN FROM CANADA, ARTIC AIR MASS PUSHING NOTICE TOWARDS THE NORTHERN PLAINS. NOW, SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS STRETCHING FROM TEXAS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI, THE TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEY NORTHEAST. YOU KNOW THERE IS GOING TO BE FLIGHT DELAYS AND CANCELLATIONS THERE IS THE RAIN TO COME FOR SOME OF THESE AREAS ALREADY RECEIVED A COUPLE INCHES OF RAINFALL. THEN FOR THE NORTHEAST, TODAY IS GOING TO BE THE MESSIEST DAY AS WE GET INTO THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, A BETTER DAY BUT THEN ANOTHER ROUND OF STORMS COME IN FOR THE WEEKEND. SO, MUCH OF THE COUNTRY INTO THIS ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN. CAN YOU SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE VERY COLD AIR AND THEN THE VERY WARM AIR ACROSS THE SOUTH. AND WE ACTUALLY COULD SEE SOME SEVERE STORMS ON MONDAY, INCLUDING TORNADOES. THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG STORY. BUT LOOK AT THE AIR TRAVEL STATISTICS. OVER 1,000 ROUTES, PLANES ON ROUTE AND THEN WE HAVE OVER 400 DELAYS. 25 CANCELLATIONS, YOUR WORST AIRPORTS ARE LOS ANGELES AND THEN LOOKS LIKE DELTA, UNITED AND SKY WEST. SO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY, CALL AHEAD AND MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON TOP OF IT BECAUSE WE ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO SEE DELAYS THAT HAPPENS HERE IN THE NORTHEAST. YOU HAVE GOT THAT RIPPLE EFFECT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. FOX WEATHER.COM KEEP YOU UP TO DATE. BRIAN KILMEADE OVER TO YOU.  Brian: ALL RIGHT. THANKS SO MUCH. MEANWHILE, COMING UP, ALEC BALDWIN OF ALL PEOPLE HONORING HARRY AND MEGHAN GLITZY NEW YORK CITY GALA LAST NIGHT. THIS AHEAD OF THEIR RELEASE OF NETFLIX DOCUSERIES NOBODY WANTS TO SEE.

        "trs": " Harris: RON DeSANTIS TEAM IS FIRING BACK AFTER LATEST LIBERAL MEDIA ATTACK ON THE FLORIDA GOVERNOR, NEW MEDIA OUTLET EXPLAINS THAT DESANTIS QUOTE, BUILDING HIS OWN MEDIA ECOSYSTEM IN FLORIDA, IT CLAIMS THE GOVERNOR IS FREEZING OUT THE MAINSTREAM PRESS WHILE ENJOYING LUXURY OF GIVING INTERVIEWS TO OUTLETS BACKED BY GOP DONORS. THE PRESS SECRETARY TWEETED IT IS NOT LUXURY TO HAVE PRINT AND CORPORATE MEDIA STACKED AGAINST YOU, CONSERVATIVES HAVE TO FIGHT BACK AND ACCEPT BIASSED AND DISHONEST MEDIA ARE ENTITLED TO ATTENTION OR ACCESS, MAYBE THIS IS WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT.  RON DeSANTIS MAKES NO SENSE TO ME, GUN SAFETY ADVOCATES --  NOT JUST ON THIS LIST, IN GENERAL.  BY THE WAY, THAT WAS A BLANKET STATEMENT.  ZELENSKYY ON THE CUSP OF WINNING THE LARGEST LAND WAR IN EUROPE AGAINST COUNTRY 10 TIMES ITS SIZE, THAT IS VICTORY HE HAS IN HIS SIGHTS, RON DeSANTIS WON MIAMI DADE COUNTY.  Harris: FIGHTING AGAINST THE MEDIA NOT ON YOUR SIDE, DO THEY NOT THINK THAT EXISTS?  Martha: ANY TIME THERE IS A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE OR LEADER, THEY WILL ATTACK THEM REGARDLESS, REGARDLESS OF THE SUCCESS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CASE OF DESANTIS, WHERE HE WAS LITERALLY A LANDSLIDE WHAT WE SAW IN FLORIDA AND REALLY THE FACT HE'S BEEN ABLE TO TAKE A PURPLE STATE, TURN IT INTO RED AND MOTIVATE AND WIN CRITICAL COUNTIES LIKE MIAMI DADE THAT HE WON BY 11 POINTS. THEY DON'T CRITICIZE SECRETARY OF TREASURY JANET YELLEN, BUT DEFINITELY RON DeSANTIS, HE CAN'T GET, THEY ABSOLUTELY CRITICIZE HIM BECAUSE THEY KNOW HE IS THE ONE THAT STANDS UP AGAINST LEFTIST MEDIA.  Harris: SO MANY REASONS JANET YELLEN COME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THE ONE SHE SAID IF YOU DON'T HAVE ABORTION, BLACK WOMEN AND THE FACT THEY CAN'T GET ABORTION WILL HURT THE ECONOMY AND WE WILL BE THE PROBLEM? IS THAT AN EXAMPLE? WONDERING WHICH YOU MEAN.  Martha: THEY SAID INFLATION WAS TEMPORARY, THAT PART, AS WELL, SHE'S BROUGHT REALLY NOTHING TO THE TABLE. YOU HAVE RON DeSANTIS, WHO HAS BECOME A WLEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND WILL BE A FORCE OF NATURE GOING INTO THE NEXT TWO YEARS.  Harris: EMILY, IT IS FEAR, TOO, RON DeSANTIS OPPOSITE OF JOE BIDEN, IF EITHER RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2024, I WON'T SAY HE IS HALF BIDEN'S AGE, THAT WOULD MEAN I CAN'T SUBTRACT, BUT HE'S CLOSE AND HAS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THE ELECTORATE, HE'S NOT HATING HALF THE PEOPLE.  Emily: IT IS DIFFERENT IN A SMARTPHONE AND ROTARY PHONE.  RECORD PLAYER.  Emily: EXACTLY. IT IS MAKING A COMEBACK. RECORD PLAYERS ARE ENDEARING, I JUST FIND ESPECIALLY NOW AS YOU TAKE THEM IN COMPARISON TO EACH OTHER, PROWESS OF LEADERSHIP AND GOVERNORING, POSITIVE IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES, INTELLECTUAL CLARITY, VERBAL SKILLS, COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND I APPRECIATE HIS TEAM IS THE SAME, REFLECTION FROM THE TOP DOWN HITS THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. YOU ARE CALLING IT A LUXURY? THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. WE REFUSE TO ENABLE PARTISAN LEFT-WING MEDIA, REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ACCESS IS DENIED US AND SOMEHOW MEANS THAT OUR VALUE IS LESS. WE REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SELF-AGRON DISINFORMATIONMENT OF THE LEFT-WING MEDIA AND SAY SELF-PROCLAIMED PROM KING AND QUEEN, I MUST BOW AT YOUR FEET, IT IS RIDICULOUS. DO YOUR RESEARCH, YOU SAY I HAVEN'T INTERVIEWED WITH CBS, MULTIPLE DURING HURRER IAN, I REFUSE TO DO YOUR -- TICK BY TICK, LINED UP AND ACTUALLY REFUTED EVERYTHING THAT WAS IN THE ARTICLES AND I JUST FIND THIS IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG AS HE GOES FORWARD, IT WILL GET UGLIER ON THEIR SIDE.  Harris: YOU MENTION THE WORD LUXURY, MARTHA, SOMETHING ELSE POPPED IN THE COMMENT ABOUT WHAT CONSERVATIVES FACE IN THE MEDIA, THIS IDEA ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POLITICAL AISLE, THERE IS NOT JUST FAN GIRLING THAT GOES ON FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES AMONG MAINSTREAM MEDIA, IT IS COMPLICITY, EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY. HOW MANY LIBERAL LEANING JOURNALISTS WILL PUSH THE PRESIDENT ON THE BORDER AND GOING TO PHOENIX AND NOT GOING TO THE BORDER? NO, IT IS NOT A 15-MINUTE DRIVE, YOU CAN LEARN A LOT GOING FROM PHOENIX TO THE BORDER, THERE IS A WHOLE LOT TO SEE.  Martha: FOR SURE, I WATCH COMMENTS OF THE PEOPLE, I THINK, IT IS NOT ABOUT YOU AND WHAT YOU THINK, IT IS ABOUT WHAT THE VOTERS THINK AND IF YOU TRAVEL AROUND FLORIDA, YOU WILL HEAR PEOPLE SAY, I LOVE OUR GOVERNOR. I AM AMAZED AT THE UNABASHED INCYNICAL NATURE OF PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY I COME ACROSS IF FLORIDA WHO SAYS, HE DID A GREAT JOB ON COVID, OUR SENIOR CITIZENS WERE TAKEN CARE OF, BUSINESSES AND SCHOOLS WERE OPEN, INCREASED THE TAX BASE BECAUSE PEOPLE MOVED THERE. I THINK WHEN I SEE ARTICLES WRITTEN ABOUT HOW HE'S AWKWARD AND THIS IS THAT, WE'LL SEE HOW THIS WORKS OUT IN THE PRIMARY PROCESS, ALL THAT MATTERS IS WHAT VOTERS THINK. CAN HE LEVERAGE ACTIONS INTO VOTES? THAT IS AS REPORTERS WHAT WE'LL BE COVERING AND I DON'T CARE ABOUT THE NOISY STUFF THAT PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED HE COULD BE CONSIDERED PERSON OF THE YEAR, I DON'T THINK IT IS SHOCKING AT ALL. HE'S A RISING STAR IN HIS PARTY AND GOTTEN A TON OF ATTENTION AND HE SHOULD BE ON THE SHORT LIST.  Harris: AND HIS STATE HAS HAD TRAGEDIES, THAT WAS THE HURRICANE.  Martha: IT IS RESULTS THAT MATTER TO VOTERS AND PEOPLE ON THE GROUND, THEY DON'T CARE WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT AROUND THE MORNING JOE TABLE.  Harris: THAT WAS HURRICANE IAN, HE GALVANIZED RESCUERS FROM ISRAEL AND WAS AT THE NEWS CONFERENCES GIVING EVERYBODY A BITE OF THE APPLE. YOUR THOUGHT? MAS  Marc: THE REASON THEY ARE GOING AFTER HIM, HE IS A THREAT, HE WON WOMEN BY SEVEN POINTS AND HISPANIC VOTERS BY 21 POINTS, HIGHEST SHARE OF NONWHITE VOTE IN HISTORY AND WON PALM BEACH AND MIAMI DADE, WHICH ARE DEMOCRATIC.  Harris: COMING UP CALIFORNIA IS LOOKING TO SPEND MORE THAN HALF TRILLION ON REPARATIONS AND THERE ARE OTHER PLACES IN THE UNITED STATES THAT WANT TO DO SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR, WE'LL GET INTO IT. 20221206173727.960|20221206174034.062",

        "trs": " WELCOME BACK, MIDTERM ELECTIONS OF 2022 ARE ALMOST EVER OVER, BUT THERE IS A RUNOFF AS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. IN THE GENERAL ELECTION, INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK BEAT HERSCHEL WALKER BY 36,000 PLUS VOTES NEITHER CANDIDATE GOT TO 50%. GEORGIA STATE RUN OFF TOMORROW. NOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THE ADVANCE VOTES SO FAR FOR THIS RUN OFF, IT'S GETTING INTO RECORD-SETTING TERRITORY. YOU ARE ARE AT 1.8 PLUS 3 MILLION VOTERS EITHER MAILING IN THEIR BALLOTS BUT EARLY PERSON VOTE. ING YOU CAN'T GO BY CANDIDATE THOUGH. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO SPLIT THEIR TICKET AND VOTE DIFFERENT WAYS. ONE OF THE INTERESTING QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS IS WHETHER SUPPORTERS OF BRIAN KEMP WILL THIS TIME COME OUT AND SUPPORT HERSCHEL WALKER. KEMP HAS BEEN DOING ADS AND ALSO APPEARING WITH WALKER TO TRY TO SUPPORT HIM AND GET HIM ACROSS THE FINISH LINE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE SENATE. DEMOCRATS HOLD 50 SEAT TO REPUBLICANS 489. IN WALKER UNSEATS WARNOCK THE SENATE IS SPLIT 50/50. STALL THE DEMOCRATIC AGENDA ANOTHER SEAT ON ALL THE COMMITTEES SO IT WOULD BE SPLIT. IF WARNOCK WINS THAT WOULD GIVE DEMOCRATS A MAJORITY OF 51:49. A MAJORITY IN ALL THE COMMITTEES, ONE EXTRA SEAT SO THEY CAN PUSH THROUGH THEIR AGENDA AND ALSO GIVES THEM PRETTY MUCH SUBPOENA POWER FOR INVESTIGATIONS. IT GIVES THEM MORE LEEWAY TO ISSUE SUBPOENAS WITHOUT REPUBLICAN BUY IN. IT ALSO MEANS MORE BREATHING ROOM FOR THE ELECTION CYCLE AND THAT IS BECAUSE REPUBLICANS ARE IT DEFENDING 10 SEATS IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP THEY ARE DEFENDING DIFFERENT STATES THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY MORE VULNERABLE. DEMOCRATS WILL BE DEFENDING 23 SENATE SEATS AND THAT MEANS IN HEAVILY WEST VIRGINIA AND MONTANA, THEY HAVE TO DEFEND THOSE. REPUBLICANS LOST TWO CRUCIAL RUN OFF ELECTION LAST CYCLE YOU MAY REMEMBER AND THAT GAVE SENATE CONTROL TO DEMOCRATS. INCUMBENT SENATOR DAVID PERDUE WOUND UP RECEIVING 239,000 VOTES FEWER THAN HE DID IN THE RUN OFF ELECTION THAN HE DID IN THE GENERAL. HIS OPPONENT DEMOCRAT JON OSSOFF ACTUALLY SAW A DROP OFF OF ONLY 104,000 VOTES AND THAT'S WHERE HE WENT FOR THE WIN. WARNOCK BEAT INCUMBENT REPUBLICAN KELLY LOEFFLER IN THE SPECIAL ELECTION RUN OFF AND HE WON BY ABOUT 93,000 VOTES. HE RECEIVED MAJOR SUPPORT FROM THE ATLANTA METRO AREA AND COUNTIES LIKE FULTON, COBB, HENRY. WARNOCK PERFORMED SEVERAL POINTS BETTER IN THE RUN OFF THAN DID HE IN THE GENERAL. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS CENTRAL FIGURE IN THAT RUN OFF ELECTION BACK THEN. HIS INSISTENCE THAT THE 2020 ELECTION WAS RIGGED. DREW SHARP CRITICISM FROM HIS OWN PARTY. A SPEECH IN NORTHERN GEORGIA WAS QUESTIONED WHETHER IT HELD PEOPLE HOME AND DIDN'T TURN OUT. REPUBLICANS DIDN'T TURN OUT FOR THOSE TWO NUMBERS TURN AROUND THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAS LARGELY BEEN MISSING FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL; HOWEVER, HE IS DOING A TELE TOWN HALL FOR MECIAL WALKER TONIGHT. NOW IN THE RUN OFF TOMORROW THE QUESTION IS WHO WILL TURN OUT IN THE STRONG METRO AREAS LIKE FULTON COUNTY. POPULATION IS 9.9%. IT'S NUMBER 1 OUT OF THE 59 COUNTIES FROM GEORGIA. WARNOCK BEAT LOEFFLER IN FULTON COUNTY BY 45 POINTS IN THE LAST RUN OFF. HE ADDED TO THAT NUMBER IN THE 2022 GENERAL ELECTION. 49 POINTS AS YOU SEE HERE. MEANWHILE, WALKER IS TRYING TO REPLICATE THE COALITION THAT WAS FOR BRIAN KEMP. AND THAT'S UP HERE IN CHEROKEE COUNTY. KEMP WON BY 49 POINTS BUT, AS YOU SEE, WALKER ONLY WON BY 38 POINTS. HE IS GOING TO HOPE FOR HIGHER TURN OUT IN THOSE G.O.P. COUNTIES, ESPECIALLY WITH KEMP BACKING HIM UP. WITH NEARLY 2 MILLION VOTES, ALREADY CAST, FROM THIS RUN OFF. THE QUESTION IS WHO TURNS OUT TOMORROW AND HOW DOES THIS ALL COME TOGETHER FOR EITHER WARNOCK OR WALKER WITH THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE U.S. SENATE HANGINGS IN THE BALANCE? LET'S GET AN UPDATE TONIGHT FROM GEORGIA. CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT AISHAH HASNIE IS IN KENNESAW THIS EVENING.  CAME RAIN, SUN OR SHINE. WE HAVE GOT TO GET OUT THERE AND LET THEM KNOW WE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF THIS.  WE NEED PEOPLE TO SHOW UP TOMORROW.  A FINAL SPRINT IN A LONG, TUMULTUOUS CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH A GRUELING FOUR STOPS FOR INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK AND FIVE EVENTS FOR REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER HERSCHEL WALKER. THE LATEST CNN POLL PUTS WARNOCK AHEAD OF WALKER BY A MERE FOUR POINTS.  WHY DO YOU THINK THE POLLS ARE SO CLOSE AGAIN?  LISTEN, THE ONLY POLL THAT COUNTS IS TOMORROW. AND SO WE WILL SEE HOW CLOSE IT IS TOMORROW. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT'S NOT CLOSE, MY RECORD AND HERSCHEL WALKER'S RECORD.  RUN OFF VOTING IS ALREADY SHATTERING RECORDS. THE OUTCOME NOW DEPENDS ON ELECTION DAY TURNOUT.  HERSCHEL WALKER DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME AND WARNOCK DOES. IT WAS JUST -- IT WAS EASY.  WALKER HAS BEEN PLAGUED THIS ENTIRE CYCLE OF ALLEGATIONS PAYING FOR ABORTIONS AND ABUSING EXLOVERS WHICH HE DENIES.  I DON'T NECESSARILY LOVE HERSCHEL WALKER. I DON'T CARE FOR WARNOCK OR OSSOFF.  FOOTBALL STAR ALSO RECENTLY DENIED HE IS HIDING FROM THE MEDIA. BUT AT A RALLY SUNDAY HIS CAMP TRIED TO BLOCK OUR TEAM FROM ASKING A QUESTION.  GOT STAND BACK PLEASE.  CAN WE SHOUT A QUICK QUESTION. WE ARE GOING DO HIM IF HE CAN CLOSE THE GAP.  NO MA'AM?  HECIALG, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN CLOSE THE GAP? AND BRET, TONIGHT HERSCHEL WALKER IS JOINED ON THE STAGE BEHIND ME WITH U.N. FORMER U.N. AMBASSADOR NIKKI HALEY, BUT BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES HAVE BEEN KEEPING THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTY LEADERS AT AN ARM'S LENGTH WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AS YOU MENTIONED HOLDING A TELE RALLY FOR WALKER TONIGHT AND PRESIDENT BIDEN CALLING IN TO AN ATLANTA RADIO STATION TODAY TO GET OUT THE VOTE. BRET?  Bret: AISHAH HASNIE LIVE IN GEORGIA IN KENNESAW, THANKS. ARIZONA'S TOP OFFICIALS HAVE CERTIFIED THE MIDTERM ELECTION RESULTS THERE. THAT ACTION OPENS A FIVE-DAY WINDOW FOR FORMAL ELECTION CHALLENGES. REPUBLICAN GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE KARI LAKE IS EXPECTED TO FILE A LAWSUIT AFTER WEEKS OF CRITICIZING THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE ELECTION. THE ADMINISTRATION RUN BY DEMOCRATS. THE RESULTS SHOW SHE LOST TO DEMOCRAT KATIE HOBBS BY ABOUT 17,000 VOTES. UP NEXT, TALK OF A BIPARTISAN DEAL FOR A FRAMEWORK ON IMMIGRATION REFORM. WHERE IS THAT GOING? FRUSTRATION FROM THE PARENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO STUDENTS MASSACRED THREE WEEKS AGO, WE WILL BRING YOU THERE AS WELL.  WE JUST HAVE NO INFORMATION FAMILY IT'S TOUGH DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY. \u266a 20221205232700.016|20221205233205.588",

        "trs": "\u266a \u266a  WE SEE THIS AS AN INTERESTING, OR A COINCIDENCE, IF I MAY, THAT HE WOULD SO HAPHAZARDLY -- TWITTER WOULD SO HAPHAZARDLY PUSH THIS DISTRACTION. TWITTER IS FACING REAL AND SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RISING VOLUME OF ANGER, HATE, AND ANTI-SEMITISM ON THEIR PLATFORM.  WHAT ELON MUSK HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO -- NOW WE KNOW AT THE WHITE HOUSE WANTED TO FIGHT SO STRONGLY AGAINST HIM OWNING TWITTER. ALL HE HAS DONE IS PUT OUT THE TRUTH. NO NEED TO START LOOKING AT FACEBOOK, AT GOOGLE.  Bret: AND KEVIN McCARTHY, POSSIBLY THE NEXT SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE, TALKING ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION TO COME. SAYING THAT TWITTER CENSORSHIP FILES, WITH THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS, THE LAST TWO ELECTIONS, SHOULD BE DEEPLY TROUBLING TO THOSE ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT. THEY HAVE AUTHORITY BY DINT OF ACCESS THAT ISN'T CONFIRMABLE TO THE PRESS, WHICH TAKES THEIR SPIN AS GOSPEL. THIS IS A FORM OF POLITICAL CORRUPTION THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPOSED AND PERHAPS THE TWITTER DOCUMENTS WILL HELP TO UNLOCK THIS STORY. LET'S BRING IN THIS PANEL, GUY BENSON, TownHall.com, A HOST OF \" \"THE GUY BENSON SHOW,\" KATIE PAVLICH, WHIT -- WHAT DO U MAKE OF THE TWITTER VEILS THAT CAME OUT AND THE REACTION OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.  I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,\" BEEN A LOT MADE ABOUT THE TWITTER FILES BEING ABOUT EXPOSING DEMOCRATS AND THEIR CONTROL OVER THE PUBLIC CONVERSATION ON THAT PLATFORM BEFORE ELON MUSK WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE IT AND REVEAL WHAT WAS GOING ON DURING THE 29TH ELECTION AND, AS HE SAID, HE IS GOING TO PUT MORE INFORMATION OUT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT. THE BIGGEST ISSUE HERE IS, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USING A PRIVATE ENTITY, A PRIVATE COMPANY, NOT TO DO SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO LEGALLY OR CONSTITUTIONALLY. THEY ARE USING A PRIVATE INSTITUTION TO CENSOR SPEECH THAT THEY DISAGREE WITH, THAT THEY CLAIM WAS DISINFORMATION OR MISINFORMATION, BASED ON FACT. A REAL SERIOUS PROBLEM FOR THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY WHEN YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF HIGH-PROFILE, VERY POWERFUL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, GOING AFTER POLITICAL OPPONENTS BY USING PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO DO SO. NOW, WHEN IT COMES TO THE FUTURE AND WHAT HAPPENS ON CAPITOL HILL, INCOMING HOUSE JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN JIM JORDAN HAS SAID HE HAS GOING TO BRING A COUPLE OF HIS FORMER INTELLIGENCE OFFICIALS, INCLUDING JAMES CLAPPER, D AND I, AND THEN CIA, SIGNED THAT LETTER SAYING THAT THEY HUNTER-BIDEN LAPTOP WAS DISINFORMATION TO GET INTO WHAT HOW MUCH ABUSE IS GOING ON WHENT COMES TO INFORMATION BEING PUSHED AND THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES CENSORING SPEECH, NOT ONLY JUST TRUE, BUT THAT THEY DON'T AGREE WITH.  Bret: JEFF, WE SAW WITH THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SAID IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS. WE'VE ALSO SEEN HUNTER BIDEN ON THE FAMILY TRIP TO NANTUCKET AS WELL AS THE KENNEDY CENTER HONORS IN PROMINENT POSITIONS. IS THE WHITE HOUSE AT ALL -- DOES IT SEEM  -- WORRIED ABOUT THE INVESTIGATIONS TO COME ON THIS FRONT?  IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. I AM NOT SURE IF WORRIED IS THE RIGHT WORD. I THINK THEY ARE PREPARING FOR IT. I THINK THEY ARE RESIGNED TO IT. I THINK THEY ARE NOT PLEASED ABOUT IT. BUT I ALSO THINK, FROM THE WHITE HOUSE'S PERSPECTIVE, THEY SEE THIS AS A POTENTIAL CHANCE OR OPPORTUNITY OR A RISK, ANYWAY, WHICH IS THE BEST OF THOSE THREE WORDS, THAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL OVERREACH. THOUGH IT IS NOT EXACTLY A POSITIVE POLITICAL STORY FOR PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, IT COULD END UP HAVING IRONIC POSITIVE POLITICAL DIVIDENDS, IF IT ENDS UP BEING THE MAIN FOCUS OF REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON INFLATION AND OTHER POCKETBOOK ISSUES THAT REPUBLICANS RAN ON IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.  Bret: TO THAT POINT, GUY, THE FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WITH HIS ORIGINAL REACTION ON TRUE SOCIAL TWITTER FILES SAYING THAT MASSIVE FRAUD LIKE THIS, \"ALLOWS THE TERMINATION OF ALL RULES, REGULATIONS, ARTICLES, EVEN THOSE FOUND IN THE CONSTITUTION,\" TO SAY HE SAID IT WAS FAKENESS, CONVINCING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HE WANTED TO TERMINATE THE CONSTITUTION, TRYING TO CHANGE THE PERCEPTION. HERE IS A COUPLE OF REPUBLICANS REACTING TO THOSE STATEMENTS.  WEEK AFTER WEEK HE IS DOING THINGS THAT ARE MAKING THEM LESS AND LESS VIABLE AS A WINNER IN '24 AND THAT IS GOING TO CATCH UP WITH HIM.  I CERTAINLY DON'T ENDORSE THAT LANGUAGE OR THAT SENTIMENT. I THINK THE FORMER PRESIDENT WOULD BE WELL ADVISED TO FOCUS ON THE FUTURE IF HE IS GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN.  Bret: WHAT IS CLEAR IS THAT PRETTY MUCH EVERY REPUBLICAN IS BEING ASKED THIS QUESTION OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS, GUY.  I'M SURE THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT BUT THEY SORT OF HAVE TO BECAUSE HE IS A DECLARED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PICK THE ARE DERANGED THINGS FOR HIM TO BE SAYING, SUGGESTING THAT ELEMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND OTHER RULES JUST BEAT MAYBE TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED BECAUSE HE DOESN'T LIKE AN OUTCOME. LOOK, I RECOGNIZE HE IS FRUSTRATED BY WHAT WAS REVEALED OVER THE WEEKEND, SORT OF WHAT WE KIND OF KNEW HAD HAPPENED, THIS COLLUSION OF VARIOUS FORCES TO BERRIEN CENSOR AND SUPPRESS AN IMPORTANT STORY RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION. IS ANGERING AS THAT MIGHT BE AS A DIRTY TRICK, MAYBE A BIG ONE OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS, YOU DON'T START TALKING ABOUT SUSPENDING THE CONSTITUTION OR ENDING OR TERMINATING PARTS OF THE CONSTITUTION FOR YOUR OWN ENDS AND REPUBLICANS ARE BEING FORCED TO TALK ABOUT THIS, ALMOST UNIVERSALLY DENOUNCING IT, AS THEY SHOULD.  Bret: HERE IS HOW THE ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITES THE SUPREME COURT CASE, INTERESTING TO HEAR THE ORAL ARGUMENTS, TO HEAR THE JUSTICE'S QUESTIONS. THE LATEST CLASH AND RELIGIOUS AND GAY RIGHTS, THE CASE COMES UP TO HIM IN THE COURT HAS DOMINATED 673 BY CONSERVATIVES, FOLLOWING A SERIES OF CASES IN WHICH THE JUSTICES HAVE SIDED WITH RELIGIOUS PLAINTIFFS. ACROSS FROM THE STREET, FINALIZING A LANDMARK BILL PROTECTING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. HERE IS JUST ONE QUESTION FROM ELENA KAGAN.  WHAT IS THE SPEECH THAT IS REQUIRED OF YOUR CLIENT THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT?  SHE BELIEVES THAT SAME-SEX WEDDINGS CONTRADICT SCRIPTURE AND SHE IS ANNOUNCING A CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE THAT -- DENOUNCING A CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE THAT SHE BELIEVES TO B.  Bret: JEFF, IT IS INTERESTING TO HEAR THIS, BUT IT IS NOT LIKE READING THE TEA LEAVES ABOUT THE QUESTIONS BEING ASKED. INTERESTING TO HEAR A CASE LIKE THIS OF SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT POTENTIALLY.  ABSOLUTELY. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE SUPREME COURSE WEEDING INTO AN ISSUE THAT IS REALLY A PART OF AMERICAN CULTURE AND THE POLITICAL AND CULTURAL WARS. THE BIG CASE THAT HAPPENED THIS SUMMER, THIS LAST SUMMER, HAD TO DO WITH ABORTION, A RULING ABOUT GAY RIGHTS AND, IN THIS CASE, THE COMBINATION OF THAT WITH FREE SPEECH WOULD CERTAINLY BE CONTROVERSIAL. IT MIGHT BE POLITICALLY BENEFICIAL TO SOME PEOPLE. IN TERMS OF PUTTING THAT ISSUE OUT THERE, IT IS DEFINITELY PUTTING FOCUS ON THE SUPREME COURT ON A HOT BUTTON SOCIAL TOPIC.  Bret: THE SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BILL, AS I MENTIONED, MAKING ITS WAY TO THE WHITE HOUSE AFTER PASSING IN THE SENATE. IN THE GEORGIA RUNOFF, KATIE, HEADING IN, THE POLLS SHOW INCUMBENT SENATE RAPHAEL WARNOCK WITH A LEAD, PERHAPS WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR, DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT, HAS IT ABOUT 3-SOMETHING POINTS, A LITTLE BIT MORE, 4 POINTS. YOUR TAKE AS -- RUNOFFS ARE DIFFERENT THAN ANY KIND OF DIFFERENT ELECTION.  THEY ARE, GEORGIA HAS HAD A LOT OF THAT, BRIAN KEMP, REAL IT BE ELECTED GOVERNOR, IT SAILED THROUGH ELECTION AGAINST STACEY ABRAMS, CAMPAIGNING FOR THAT, LINDSEY GRAHAM, A REPUBLICAN ON THE SENATE, EXPLAINING HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR REPUBLICANS TO ENACT THAT SEAT BASED ON 5050/50 SPLIT IN THE SENATE WITH EQUAL REPRESENTATION, A 51-49 SENATE, GET DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY MORE POWER THAN THEY HAD BEFORE ELECTION DAY IN.  Bret: BIG DEAL. WE WILL HAVE THE RESULTS TOMORROW. PANEL, THANK YOU.  THANKS, BRET. \u266a \u266a  Bret: FINALLY, TONIGHT, A SPECIAL DAY, A COMMUNITY FAVORITE ATTRACTION RETURNED TO SPREAD SOLID EACH YEAR. THESE VOLUNTEERS DESIGNED THIS WINTER WONDERLAND IN ILLINOIS, FEATURES MORE THAN 200,000 LIGHTS COME UP 100s OF THOUSANDS FIGURINES, THE SPECTACLE ATTRACTS THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS EACH YEAR.

        "trs": " Martha: THE CLASH BETWEEN RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AND GAY RIGHTS IN A CASE THAT IS NOW BEING HEARD BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT. LORI SMITH, CHRISTIAN GRAPHIC DESIGNER, SAID CREATING WEDDING WEBSITES FOR GAY COUPLES GOES AGAINST HER FAITH. SO NOW SHE'S FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHT TO TURN AWAY CUSTOMERS THAT WANT WEBSITES BUILD FOR THEIR SAME-SEX MARRIAGES. LORI AND HER ATTORNEY ARE STANDING BY EXCLUSIVELY HERE FOR THE STORY TODAY. BUT FIRST TO DAVID SPUNT WITH THE BACK STORY FROM THE SUPREME COURT. HI, DAVID.  HI, MARTHA. LORI SMITH AND HER ATTORNEYS SAID IT'S SIMPLE. THIS IS ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND HER FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS WERE TRAMPLED UPON BY THIS COLORADO STATE LAW. SHE SAYS ULTIMATELY, MARTHA, THAT HER FAITH IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN PROFIT. THE MONEY GOING IN THE BANK. THERE WAS QUITE A SHOWING OUTSIDE TODAY FOR LORI SMITH. IN THIS CASE, SEVERAL HUNDRED PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE COURT THIS MORNING. SHE RUNS 303 CREATIVE. IT'S A ONLINE GRAPHIC DESIGN FIRM REFUSING TO CREATE ONES TOM WEDDING WEBSITES FOR SAME SEX COUPLES SAYING IT GOES AND HER READING OF MARRIAGE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN. HERE SHE WAS THIS MORNING.  MY DECISION ON WHAT I CREATE IS CUSTOM. ALWAYS BASED ON THE MESSAGE, NEVER ABOUT THE PERSON REQUESTING THE MESSAGE. THERE ARE SOME MESSAGES THAT I CREATE NO MATTER WHO REQUESTS THEM.  OKAY, MARTHA. THE COLORADO ANTI-DISCRIMINATION AGAINST FOR BIDS BUSINESS OWNERS FROM REFUSING PUBLIC SERVICES BASED ON RACE, DISABILITY AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION AMONG OTHER PROTECTED CLASSES. OFFICIALS MAKE IT CLEAR IF YOU OFFER A PRODUCT IN COLORADO, EVEN AN ARTISTIC SERVICE, IT MUST BE OFFERED TO ALL.  YOU CAN'T DEFINE YOUR SERVICE SO YOU EXCLUDE AND ENTIRE CATEGORY OF PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT IS AT ISSUE HERE. IF THERE WERE TO BE A LOOP HOLE OF THE KIND DISCUSSED, PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, ARMS, JEWS, MUSLIMS, OTHERS COULD FIND THEMSELVES WITHOUT ACCESS TO THE MARKETPLACE. THAT'S WHAT THIS CASE IS ABOUT.  THE NINE JUSTICES LISTENED TO ARGUMENTS FOR 2 1/2 HOURS GETTING TO THE CORE OF THE FREE SPEECH ISSUE.  WHAT IS THE SPEECH THAT IS REQUIRED OF YOUR CLIENT THAT WOULD VIOLATE THE FIRST AMENDMENT?  SHE BELIEVES THAT SAME-SEX WEDDINGS CONTRADICT SCRIPTURE AND SHE'S ANNOUNCING A CONCEPT OF MARRIAGE THAT SHE BELIEVES TO BE FALSE.  THE 6-3 CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY SEEM TO FAVOR THE ARGUMENTS FROM KRISTIN WAGONER THAT WILL JOIN YOU IN JUST A MOMENT. THE JUSTICES WILL AGAIN DELVE IN TO A CONTENTION ISSUE AND HEAR SOMETHING BY THE END OF JUNE, EARLY JULY. MARTHA?  Martha: THANKS, DAVID. WITH THAT WE BRING IN LORI SMITH, THE WOMAN AT THE HEART OF THIS CASE. SHE'S THE FOUNDER OF 303 CREATIVE AND JOINED BY HER ATTORNEY, KRISTEN WAGGONER. GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. LORI, THE ARGUMENT THAT IS BEING MADE BY THE OTHER SIDE IS THAT WHEN YOU OFFER SERVICES, YOU HAVE TO OFFER THEM TO ALL. TO EVERYONE. YOU HEARD WHAT THE ACLU ATTORNEY THERE WAS SAYING. TELL ME WHAT THAT VIOLATES FOR YOU, LORI?  I WANT TO CREATE UNIQUE ONE OF A KIND EXPRESSION OF ARTWORK. I WANT TO DESIGN WEBSITES, WEDDING WEBSITES SPECIFICALLY THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH MY FAITH. THE STATE OF COLORADO IS COMPELLING AND CONTROLLING MY SPEECH, CHILLING IT AND FORCING ME TO COMMUNICATE A MESSAGE THROUGH MY CUSTOM UNIQUE ARTWORK. AT THE CORE OF THIS CASE IS THE RIGHT FOR ALL TO SPEAK FREELY. THAT PROTECTS MYSELF, THE LGBT WEB DESIGNER THAT SHOULD NOT BE FORCED TO CREATE CUSTOM ARTWORK THAT OPPOSES SAME SEX MARRIAGE. THE RIGHT TO SPEAK FREELY TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US AND A WIN FOR ME IS A WIN FOR EVERYBODY.  KRISTEN, ALONG THE WAY IN THIS CASE, THERE WAS AN ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE THAT BECAUSE HER CONTENT IS UNIQUE, SHE'S CREATING A MONOPOLY AND SHE'S NOT ALLOWING THIS PERSON THAT WANTS TO HAVE A SAME-SEX MARRIAGE WEBSITE ACCESS TO THAT MONOPOLY. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT ELEMENT OF THIS CASE, TO THAT ARGUMENT?  WELL THAT WOULD TURN THE FIRST AMENDMENT ON ITS HEAD THAT WOULD MEAN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US COULD BE FORCED TO EXPRESS THE GOVERNMENT'S MESSAGE. WHAT IS IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT COLORADO AGREES THAT MRS. SMITH SERVES ALL PEOPLE. SHE DOES SERVE EVERYONE. SHE HAS CLIENTS THAT IDENTIFIED AS LGBT AND SHE SERVES THEM. AS THE COURT MANY TIMES TODAY MENTIONED, HER DECISIONS TURN ON WHAT THE MESSAGE IS AND NOT WHO THE PERSON IS. WE ALL WANT THAT FREEDOM, WHETHER WE'RE A DEMOCRAT PUBLICIST AND DON'T WANT TO WRITE FOR A REPUBLICAN OR A PRO ABORTION PHOTOGRAPHER AND DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO FILM OR PHOTOGRAPH A PRO LIFE RALLY.  Martha: LORIE, YOU'RE SAYING YOU SERVE PEOPLE OF ALL DIFFERENT SEXUAL PREFERENCES, JUST WHEN IT NOT COMES TO A WEDDING WEBSITE?  I HAVE CLIENTS THAT IDENTIFY AS LGBT. I CANNOT CREATE EVERY MESSAGE REQUESTS OF ME. THERE'S SOME MESSAGES THAT I CAN'T CREATE NO MATTER WHO REQUESTS THEM. AT THE CORE OF THIS CASE IS THE RIGHT FOR EVERYONE TO SPEAK CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THEY BELIEVE, WHETHER THEIR TOPICS ARE SIMILAR TO MINE OR PERHAPS DIFFERENT. NOBODY SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR COMMUNICATING AND SPEAKING AND CREATING CUSTOM ARTWORK THAT GOES ALONG THE LINES WITH WHAT THEY BELIEVE.  Martha: SO KRISTIN, BASED ON THE QUESTIONS IN THE BACK AND FORTH FROM THE JUSTICES, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON WHERE THEY ARE ON THIS RIGHT NOW?  WELL, THE COURT HAS NEVER COMPELLED SOMEONE TO CREATE MESSAGES, USING THEIR HEART, THEIR HEAD AND THEIR HAND TO IMAGINE AND DESIGN ART AND USE WORDS AND TEXTS. THE COURT HAS NEVER COMPELLED THAT KIND OF SPEECH EVEN AT THE HEIGHT OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA THEY DIDN'T COMPEL SPEECH. THAT'S NOT THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO TELL AMERICANS WHAT IS WORTHY OF CELEBRATION. AS YOU INTROED WITH THE ACLU'S MESSAGE, IT'S DISINGENUOUS TO SAY THIS IS ABOUT SERVICE. IT'S ABOUT SPEECH.  Martha: THEY'RE SAYING THAT YOU COULD ALSO BAN JEWISH PEOPLE OR BLACK PEOPLE FROM RECEIVING THIS SERVICE, KRISTEN.  THAT'S NOT AT ALL TRUE. YOU CAN'T UNDER PUBLIC ACCOMMODATIONS LAW DENY AN ENTIRE CLASS OF PEOPLE SERVICE. AGAIN, THE COURTS ARE GOING TO RECOGNIZE THAT. NOTHING ABOUT THIS DECISION CHANGES THAT. BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT IT'S NOT THE ROLE OF THE GOVERNMENT TO MANDATE WHAT IS TRUE AND WHAT IS NOT. THAT'S THE ROLE OF THE CITIZEN, TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHAT TO EXPRESS. NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED TO EXPRESS A MESSAGE THAT VIOLATES THEIR CONVICTIONS. IN COLORADO, THEY'RE DOING IT UPON THREAT OF FINES. SOME JURISDICTIONS IMPOSE JAIL TIME.  Neil: KRISTEN, LORIE, THANKS FOR BEING HERE TODAY. WE'LL BE WATCHING THIS CLOSELY.  THANK YOU.  Martha: COMING UP, KARL ROVE AND ANDY McCARTHY AS WE MONITOR THE WHITE HOUSE BRIEFING TODAY, WHICH WAS A BIT DELAYED AND IS UNDERWAY AT THIS POINT. WE'LL GET REACTION IN TERMS OF THIS STORY ABOUT CENSORING THE HUNTER BIDEN STORY ON TWITTER AND MAKING SURE THAT IT GOT SUPPRESSED ACROSS THEIR NETWORK WHEN WE COME BACK. 20221205203342.868|20221205203750.716",

        "trs": "\u266a PAUL: THE SUPREME COURT SET TO HEAR ORAL ARGUMENTS MONDAY IN ANOTHER BIG RELIGIOUS LIBERTY CASE WITH COLORADO WEB SITE DESIGNER LORI SMITH CHALLENGING THE STATE'S ANTIDISCRIMINATION LAW SAYING IT VIOLATES HER FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH BY REQUIRING HER TO CREATE WEDDING WEB SITES FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES. CASE HAS SOME CALLING FOR AMY CONEY BARRETT TO REDUCE HERSELF WITH THE CHRISTIAN GROUP PEOPLE OF PRAISE SAYING THE JUSTICE'S AFFILIATION WITH THE ORGANIZATION MEANS SHE CANNOT RULE IMPARTIALLY. WE'RE BACK WITH DAN HENNINGER AND BILL McGURN. SO, BILL, THE STAKES IN THIS CASE, FREE SPEECH RIGHTS OF THE WEB SITE DESIGNER VERSUS THE RIGHTS OF LGBTQ PEOPLE TO BE SERVED IN PUBLIC STORES, SERVICES. WHO DO YOU THINK GETS THE BETTER ARGUMENT BEFORE THE COURT?  YEAH. FINISH WELL, I THINK THE WEB DESIGNER OR DOES. WE'RE HERE AGAIN BECAUSE THEY NEVER DECIDED THE ISSUE IN THE COLORADO CAKE BAKERS. THEY DIDN'T DECIDE WHETHER CAKE IS SPEECH, AND THEY KIND OF PUNTED ON ISSUE. THEY SAID COLORADO CIVIL RIGHTS COMMISSION WAS SO BIASED THAT HE COULDN'T GET A FAIR SHAKE. NOW THE ISSUE HAS COME BACK CLEANLY. AND AND AS YOU POINT OUT, BOTH ARE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY CASES INVOLVING HAIR BELIEF WITHS. IT'S REALLY A FUNDAMENTAL FIRST AMENDMENT CASE, AND THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING TO BE DECIDED WHETHER SHE HAS -- I DON'T SEE HOW THE JUSTICES CAN AVOID SAYING SHE HAS A RIGHT TO MAKE MESSAGES SHE LIKES AND REFUSE THOSE SHE DOESN'T. OTHERWISE YOU GET INTO COMPELLED SPEECH AND A REAL MESS. PAUL: YEAH. DAN, WHAT ABOUT THE SUGGESTIONS THAT JUSTICE BARRETT SHOULD RECUSE HERSELF BECAUSE SHE BELONGS TO PEOPLE OF PRAISE? IS DOES THAT HAVE ANY PLAUSIBILITY -- PLAUSIBLE BEHIND IT?  NONE WHATSOEVER. THE CONSTITUTION, OUR CONSTITUTION IS QUITE EXPLICIT THAT RELIGIOUS TESTS ARE NOT ALLOWED WHEN PEOPLE ARE GOING INTO PUBLIC SERVICE. THAT'S WHAT JUSTICE BARRETT IS DOING, SO THE RELIGIOUS TEST DOESN'T HAVE MY FORCE WHATSOEVER. BUT IT IS PART OF A LARGER EFFORT TO DELEGITIMIZE AND UNDERMINE THESE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES, PAUL. WE HAD THE INSTANCE OF JUSTICE THOMAS' WIFE TALKING TO THE WHITE HOUSE ABOUT ELECTION. THAT WAS TURNED INTO AN ISSUE. YOU HAD CHUCK SCHUMER STANDING IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT SAYING THAT JUSTICE GORSUCH WOULD REAP THE WHIRLWIND IF HE WENT THE WRONG WAY ON THE A ABORTION DECISION. THERE IS A CONCERTED EFFORT OUT THERE THAT HAS NOW REACHED AMY CONEY BARRETT TO MAKE THE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES NONCREDIBLE. AND IT IS ONE OF THE LEAST ADMIRABLE THINGS THAT THE LEFT HAS DONE, CONCERN IN ITS CONCENTRATE THED EFFORT TO UNDERMINE COURT. PAUL: BILL, ANOTHER BIG DECISION BY THE SUPREME COURT WEEK, AND THAT IS TO HEAR THE CHALLENGE FROM SIX STATES TO THE PRESIDENT'S STUDENT LOAN CANCELLATION. THE LOWER COURT JUDGE HAD PUT AN INJUNCTION ON IT. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WENT TO THE COURT AND SAID LIFT THAT INJUNCTION. THE COURT SAID, NO, WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THE CASE -- [LAUGHTER] AND THEY'RE GOING TO HEAR IT ON EXWE DIETED FASHION, SKIPPING OVER THE LOWER COURT'S ON THE MERITS PURE ARGUMENTS IN PEN. THEY COULD DECIDES THAT YEAR. THIS IS A VERY BIG DEAL. DOES IT PUT THE PRESIDENT'S STUDENT LOAN CANCELLATION IN JEOPARDY?  YES, IT DOES. LOOK, IT'S A VERY BAD POLICY ON ITS OWN. THE PROGRAM. BUT IT HAS RAISED PULSE QUESTIONS ABOUT SPENDING AND SO FORTH WITHIN OUR PROCESS. THE COURT SAYSST GOING TO CONSIDER TWO ISSUES, THE STANDING OF PEOPLE TO SUE, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THESE STATE ATTORNEY GENERALS HAVE SUED, AND ALSO WHETHER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION EXCEEDED ITS AUTHORITY WITH THIS. BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING, WHAT IS IT, IT'S MAYBE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. PAUL: $420 BILLION, BILL. [LAUGHTER]  YEAH, 400 -- YOU KNOW, A BILLION HERE, A BILLION THERE STARTS TO ADD UP. AND THE IDEA THAT THAT CAN GO THROUGH WITHOUT CONGRESS APPROVING IT, I THINK THAT'S VERY DANGEROUS ON ITS OWN. SO I DON'T EXPECT BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO WIN ON THAT ONE. NOT BECAUSE IT'S BAD POLICY, BUT BECAUSE WAY THEY DID IT IS SO EXTRA-'SIAL. EXTRA-CONSTITUTION TOAL. PAUL: DAN, MY TAKE ON THIS IS THAT THE COURT WOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN IN THE IF HE WERE GOING TO MERELY UPHOLD BIDEN DECISION. WHAT DO YOU THINK?  YEAH. OH, I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. AT LEAST FOUR JUSTICES HAD ANOTHER THIS, SO THEY'RE INTERESTED IN THE LARGER CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES INVOLVED HERE. AGAIN, THE $420 BILLION DISPERSED, TAXPAYER RESPONSIBILITY -- DISBURSED, IF IDEA WERE TO FLY, WE WOULDN'T IS HAVE A PRESIDENT MANY COUNTRY, WE WOULD BE BACK TO HAVING A KING WHO CAN SIMPLY DO WHATEVER HE WANTS, AND I DON'T THINK THE SUPREME COURT IS GOING TO TAKE US BACK TO 1770. PAUL: ALL RIGHT, LET'S HOPE NOT. > WHEN WE COME BACK, MAKING CIVILITY GREAT AGAIN, WE'LL TALK TO VETERAN POLLSTERS ABOUT THEIR BIPARTISAN QUEST TO BRING RESPECT BACK TO POLITICS, CULTURE AND CONVERSATION. \u266a PAUL: IN AN ERA OF DEEP POLITICAL DIVISIONS, MY NEXT GUESTS ARE A RARE EXAMPLE OF BIPARTISANSHIP, POLLSTERS AND STRATEGISTS WHO ARE -- WHO HAVE WORKED TOGETHER FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS. THEY'RE CO-AUTHORS OF THE NEW BOOK, \"A QUESTION OF RESPECT,\" WELCOME TO YOU BOTH.  THANK YOU. PAUL: SO WHEN YOU POLL, WHAT DO YOU FIND THAT PEOPLE -- HOW WORRIED ARE THEY ABOUT POLITICAL ACQUISITIONS, AND IN PARTICULAR, WHAT ARE HAY WORRIED ABOUT?  THEY ARE VERY, VERY WORRIED ABOUT POLITICAL DIVISION AND, IN FACT, THE MOST STUNNING PIECE OF DATA IN OUR SURVEYS THAT WE'VE DONE WITH GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY IS THAT PEOPLE THINK WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF CIVIL WAR. PEOPLE ALSO THINK HAT LACK OF RESPECT IS THE REAL THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY AND THAT DIVISION AND POLARIZATION ARE A REAL THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY. NOW, UNDERNEATH THAT THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES OF OPINION, BUT THE OVERALL LEVEL OF CONCERN IS EXTREMELY HIGH, AND PEOPLE THINK IT'S NOT GOING TO GET BETTER. IN A YEAR FROM NOW, PEOPLE HI IT'S GOING TO REMAIN ABOUT THE SAME. PAUL: WOW, THAT'S CONCERNING. ED, TO WHAT DO PEOPLE ATTRIBUTE -- WHO DO THEY BLAME? IS IT JUST THE OTHER PARTY IS RESPONSIBLE -- [LAUGHTER] OR IS IT EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE WHIPPING BOY, US IN THE MEDIA OR SOCIAL MEDIA? TO WHAT DO THEY ATTRIBUTE --  WELL, ALL OF THOSE COME INTO PLAY, BUT I THINK IT STARTS OFF FOR A VERY LOWERS TEEM FOR ALL THE MAJOR INSTITUTIONS TODAY WHEN IT'S GOVERNMENT, MEDIA, RELIGION OR UNIONS, ALL OF THOSE ARE AT AN ALL-TIME LOW MAINLY BECAUSE THERE'S A FEELING THAT THEY ARE NOT FIXING THEIR PROBLEMS, THEY'RE NOT DEALING WITH THEIR PROBLEMS. AND THAT BRINGS THE SINNISM. AND SINNISM THEN PLAYS -- CYNICISM PLAYS INTO BEING MORE OPEN TO DEMAGOGUERY. SO WHEN YOU DO SEE DEMAGOGUERY ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR SUPERPACs OR CAMPAIGNS OR IN THE MEDIA, IT DRIVES THAT POLARIZATION. PAUL: POLLSTERS TELL US AND HEN POLITICIANS AND CAMPAIGNS -- JOE BIDEN DID THIS, YOU KNOW, HE SAID LET'S BRING US ALL TOGETHER. AND VOTERS -- BUT DO VOTERS REALLY WANT THAT? BECAUSE SOMETIMES COMPROMISE IS NOT REWARDED POLITICALLY. I MEAN, SO TO THEY SAY, YEAH, WE WANT EVERYBODY TO LOVE EACH OTHER, BUT REALLY THEY DON'T?  WELL, THE IT'S A REALLY ASTUTE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING, AND WE DID A VERY INTERESTING EXPERIMENT ON OUR SURVEY. WE ASKED PEOPLE DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO STAND UP FOR WHAT'S RIGHT? WHO-THIRDS OF PUBLIC SAID YES. DO YOU WANT COMPROMISE? TWO-THIRDS OF THE PUBLIC SAID YES. IN TERMS OF WORKING TOGETHER, WHEN WE ASKED PEOPLE TO CHOOSE, OVER 60 PRESIDENT OF THE PEOPLE SAID I WANT PEOPLE TO WORK TOGETHER, AND THAT IS PARTICULARLY IN TRUE OF WORKING WELL. PAUL: THEY'RE PROBABLY RIGHT. AND SO, ED, WHAT ARE YOUR ANSWERS HERE? I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU TELL YOUR CLIENTS TO SAY, ALL RIGHT, PROMOTE CIVILITY AND WHAT TO DO TO WIN.  YOU'VE SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF THE CAMPAIGNS THAT I'VE WORKED IN OVER THE YEAR, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DO HATE IS OFTEN SAID AT AT CAMPAIGN ISES IS THAT NEGATIVE WORKS. I'VE ALSO HEARD SO DOES POSITIVE, YOU OUGHT TO TRY IT ONCE IN A WHILE. LAST PACT OF THE MATTER IS I DO THE THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY MANY THAT AS CELINDA SAID, 68% WOULD LIKE TO SEE COMPROMISE, AND 30% SAY, NO, I WANT YOU TO FIGHT FOR MY VALUES EVEN IF YOU DON'T GET ANYTHING DONE. AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE'VE HAD IN THE LAST 30 YEARS IS PRIMARY PROCESS HAS MOVED FROM 30, 35%, 40% SOMETIMES VOTING IN EACH PRIMARY TO NOW IT'S IN THE TEENS. SO THAT 30% IS SAYING, NO, NIGHT NO MATTER WHAT, THEY ARE ONES THAT ARE VOTING IN THE PRIMARIES. BOTH PARTIES, I THINK, ARE PILLING THE COUNTRY IN THAT THEY ARE ELECTING VERY OFTEN PEOPLE THAT ARE FROM THE FAR RIGHT AND FAR LEFT. SO THEY'RE COMING HERE HIKING HAIR JOB THE TO VOTE FOR PEOPLE IN THE PRIMARY AND NOT ACTUALLY COME HERE TO SOLVE SOME THINGS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT AT SAM POINT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS, AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT, I THINK, SOONER AS AS A OPPOSED TO LATE EVERY. PAUL: THAT WAS SULD FIXING PROCESS, E GUESS, EVEN GERRYMANDERING. WHAT ARE YOUR SPECIFIC IDEAS? THERE ARE A LOT OF STRUCTURAL CHANGES, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY INTERESTED IS WE AGREED ON PROBLEMS. WE DIDN'T ALWAYS AGREE ON THE PROCESS. WE AGREE THERE NEEDS ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM, AND JUST IN GENERAL IN OUR SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S GERRYMANDERING OR CAMPAIGN FINANCING, WE'RE INCENTIVIZING BAD BEHAVIOR NOT GOOD BEHAVIOR, AND THE VOTERS FEEL COMPLETELY US EMPOWERED. SO WE NEED TO MAKE SOME STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN OUR SYSTEM. PAUL QUICKLY, DO -- ONE THING THAT YOU WOULD DO?  I DON'T BELIEVE CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM YOU CAN DO AWAY WITH LARGE RICKSES. I THINK IT'S A GIANT BALLOON THAT IF YOU SQUEEZE THAT ON ONE END, IT GETS EVEN BIGGER ON THE OH. BUT I DO LIKE WHAT VIRGINIA HAS DONE WHICH IS MADE -- OPEN DISCLOSURE IMMEDIATELY, AND THE CAMPAIGNS GOT THE MONEY, NOT SUPERPACs. AND ONE OF BIG CONCERNS I'VEED HAD TO DEAL WITH IS IF YOU'RE LUCKY IF YOU CAN CONTROL 25 THE PRESIDENT OF THE MESSAGE. PAUL: WE HAVE TO TAKE ONE MORE BREAK. WHEN WE COME BACK, HITS AND MISSES OF THE WEEK. 20221203205517.311|20221203205753.267",

PAUL, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES JUST SPENT MONTHS RUNNING AROUND THEIR DISTRICTS VOWING THAT, IF ELECTED, THEY WOULD GET RID OF WASTEFUL GOVERNMENT SPENDING. SO I HAVE AN ENORMOUS MISS FOR THE PARTY WHICH WAS PARTLY ELECTED ON THAT AND YET IN ITS FIRST TEST OF WHETHER OR NOT IT MEANT IT, IT FAILED BY VOTING OVERWHELMINGLY THIS WEEK TO RETAIN THE MOST WASTEFUL EXAMPLE OF GOVERNMENT SPENDING, EARMARKS. EARMARKS HAD GONE AWAY ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO, THEY'RE BACK. THE APPETITE HAS ONLY GROWN, AND REPUBLICANS ARE RISKING THEIR CREDIBILITY WITH VOTERS. PAUL: MENE.  I'M GOING TO GIVE A HIT TO NEW YORK CITY MAYOR ERIC ADAMS FOR ISSUING A DIRECTIVE THAT WILL LET LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVE HE DETAIN HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO ARE DEEMED TO BE IN A SEVERE PSYCHIATRIC CRISIS. THE PREVIOUS LAW A MADE IT THAT THEY HAD TO ACTIVELY POSE A THREAT TO SOMEONE. ANYONE WHO'S SEEN THE DISORDER IN NEW YORK CITY EMPLOYEES IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE AND ALSO WILL HELP SOME OF THESE PEOPLE GET THE HELP THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED. PAUL: YEAH. MARY.  A MISS FOR THE BRITISH AMERICAN LAW FIRM HOGAN LEVELS -- LOVE ALES WHICH FIRED A TOP LAWYER BECAUSE SHE OFFERED A MINORITY OPINION WITH OTHER FEMALE LAWYERS AT THE FIRM ABOUT THE DOBBS DECISION ON ABORTION FROM THE SUPREME COURT. WHAT'S STRIKING HERE IS THAT SHE SHARED THIS OPINION IN WHAT THE FIRM BILLED AS A SAFE SPACE. AND I THINK WHAT SHOWS, THAT IN CORPORATE AMERICA YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY, THERE'S NO SUCH PLACE AS SAFE SPACES. PAUL: DAN.  THIS IS A HIT TO IRAN'S SOCCER TEAM, REPRESENTING A MISSION IN UPHEAVAL OVER THE LET'S OF A WOMAN -- OVER THE DEATH OF A WOMAN AT THE HANDS OF THE POLICE. THE IRANIAN TEAM REFUSED TO SING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IN SOLIDARITY WITH PROTESTS. THEIR FAMILIES WERE REPORTEDLY THREATENED.

        "trs": "RACHEL: ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE A FOX NEWS ALERT. ELON MUSK EXPOSES TWITTER PILES SHOWING CENSORSHIP OF HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP AND THE TECH GIANT'S POLITICAL BIAS. HE WRITES: TWITTER ACTING BY ITSELF TO SUPPRESS FREE SPEECH IS NOT A FIRST AMENDMENT VIOLATION, BUT ACTING UNDER ORDERS FROM THE GOVERNMENT TO SUPPRESS FREE SPEECH WITH NO JUDICIAL REVIEW I IS. OUR GUEST, DAN BONGINO, IS HERE TO REACT. I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH OF A TEE-UP FOR DAN BONGINO.  YEAH, LISTEN, HERE'S THE DEAL, OKAY? THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT DEPUTIZE PRIVATE ACTORS TO DO WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS FORBIDDEN FROM DOING CONSTITUTIONALLY. YOU AND I TALK ABOUT THIS TONIGHT ON MY SHOW WITH REGARDS TO THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THEY'RE TRYING TO DEPUTIZE BANKS TO GET A GUN LIST. BUT ON FREE SPEECH YOU CAN'T SAY TO TWITTER, LISTEN, YOU NEED TO DO THIS ON OUR BEHALF AND COMMUNICATE WITH GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO IT OURSELF AND DO KIND OF AN END AROUND. SEE, WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO LIBERALS, YOU HAVE TO BE -- YOU HAVE TO MAKE IT REALLY SIMPLE BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE JUST DOPEY. I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY TO SAY IT. YOU AND I ARE PRO-LIFERS, RIGHT? IF YOU WERE THE PRESIDENT, I WAS THE VICE PRESIDENT, WE CAN'T PUT OUT SOME EXECUTIVE ORDER SAYING IF WILL CAIN GOES IS AND BEATS UP SOMEONE TRYING TO GET AN ABORTION, THAT YOU CAN'T SUE WILL CAIN. WE CAN'T DO THAT, AS MUCH AS I HATE ABORTION, I CAN'T DEPUTIZE WILL TO SOP SOMEONE ON MY BEHALY BEHALF. AND I DON'T THINK LIBERALS GET THAT. AND I SAW THIS THING ABOUT RO KHANNA, AND I WAS LIKE, OKAY, WOW, A DEMOCRAT WHO ACTUALLY SEEMED TO -- PETE: YEAH.  RO, YOU KNOW, BROTHER, YOU AND I MAY NOT SHARE POLITICS ON A WITHOUT -- ON A LOT OF ISSUES, BUT IF YOU WANT TO LINK ARMS ON THE FREE SPEECH THING, THAT'S A FIGHT I'LL GO TO WAR WITH MIN, RO KHANNA, BERNIE SANDERS, BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T SPEAK, YOU DON'T HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC. RAH. RACHEL: YOU MAY WITH THE ONLY ONE THOUGH. WILL: YOU BUILT A VERY STRONG DIGITAL PRESENCE THROUGHOUT YOUR CAREER, AND CLAY TRAVIS SAID IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO THINK OF THIS AS EXCLUSIVELY A TWITTER STORY. WE KNOW ABOUT TWITTER BECAUSE ELON MUSK IS OPENING THE HOOD TO TWITTER. YOU'RE VERY STRONG ON MULTIPLE DIGITAL PLATFORMS.  YEAH. WILL: IT'S, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THE GOVERNMENT WAS MEETING WITH ALL OF THEM PRIOR TO THE ELECTION. MARK ZUCKERBERG TOLD US HAT GOVERNMENT WAS MEETING WITH FACEBOOK. HOW BROAD, HOW WILD, HOW MANY TOPICS DO YOU THINK -- HOW WIDE, DO YOU THINK THIS DEPUTIZING OF COMPANIES TO SUPPRESS THE FIRST AMENDMENT WAS? IS?  ON ANY GIVEN DAY, THE SECOND OR FIRST LARGEST FACEBOOK PAGE, ME AND BEN SHAPIRO SWAP SPOTS A LOT. THEY'VE GOT TO -- GONE TO WAR WITH MY PAGE. IT'S NOT JUST THAT THEY HAD THE FBI GO THERE. THEY USE WHAT THEY CALL FACT CHECKERS WHICH, IRONICALLY, ARE OPINION CLERKS. IF THEY DON'T LIKE AN OPINION, THEY'LL CALL SOMETHING MISSING CON TEXT. WHAT THEY DO IS IT THEN REDUCES THE REACH OF YOUR PAGE AND SHUTS YOU DOWN. AND IF YOU GET A STRIKE, YOU CAN BE ENTIRELY DEMONETIZED AND KICKED OFF THE PLATFORM. THEY NEVER DO THAT TO LIBERALS. THIS WAR ON FREE SPEECH IS REAL, GUYS. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. AND THE FACT THAT LEFTISTS CAN'T SEEM TO GET THEIR HEADS OUT OF THEIR RUMPS AND UNDERSTAND THAT A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT WITH MALICIOUS INTENT CAN TURN THIS ON THEM IS REALLY DISTURBING. YOU'VE GOT TO REMEMBER, I PUT MY MONEY WHERE MY MOUTH IS. I'VE BEEN AN INVESTOR IN A LOT OF THESE PLATFORMS, AND OUR THING OVER AT RUMBLE IS, HEY, COME ON OVER. WE LOVE LIBERALS BECAUSE THE BEST COUNTER TO FREE SPEECH YOU DON'T LIKE IS OTHER FREE SPEECH. I MEAN, DIDN'T WE USED TO ALL AGREE ON THIS? WILL: THOUGHT SO, YEAH.  ONE MORE THING ABOUT THAT ELON STORY. THE MOST DISTURBING PART OF THAT TWITTER THREAD -- AND GREAT JOB BY MATT TAIBBI WHO'S BEEN ONE OF THE FEW JOURNALISTS DOING ACTUAL JOURNALISM, I WAS GLAD HE TWEETED THAT OUT -- THEY USE TOOLS FOR CHILD PORNOGRAPHY TO MAKE SURE YOU COULDN'T EVEN DM THE LINK TO -- DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW BANANAS THAT IS? THAT IS CRAZY. WHAT ARE HAY GOING TO USE NEXT, TERRORISM RULES? PETE: YEAH, HER FINISH. RACHEL: THEY DID. [LAUGHTER]  IT'S TRUE, I SHOULD HAVE -- RACHEL: IT'S SO BAD. PETE: JANUARY 6TH AND THE WHOLE THING, IT'S ALL BECOME A RATIONALIZATION.  YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU START TO WONDER, LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED? WHEN DID THIS DEVOLVE SO QUICKLY? IT USED TO BE THE ACLU AND LEFTIST GROUPS. THERE'S A CLIP ON MY SHOW TONIGHT, I USED TO BE RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE WHO TURNED INTO A BUNCH OF CRAZED LEFTISTS. THEY ARE THE MACHINE NOW. RACHEL: YEAH.  THE LEFT IS THE MACHINE. LET'S FIGHT THE MAN, BRO. YOU ARE THE MAN, BRO. [LAUGHTER] DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? YOU'RE THE -- WE'RE THE RENEGADES NOW. WE'RE THE MISFIT CHILDREN NOW, NOT THEM. PETE: YEAH, IT'S TRUE. BY THE WAY, EARLIER WILL CAIN WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE US NOT TO HAVE CHICK-FIL-A AND INSTEAD ORDERED AN ACAI BOWL.  BIG MISTAKE. FOLKSES, THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON IN THE GREEN ROOM ARE. IT MADE IT UP STAIRS ONTO THE COUCH. I LOST, LIKE, 30 POUNDS, I HAD TO -- RACHEL: YOU LOOK AMAZING.  THANK YOU. I WAS GETTING A LITTLE SOFT. ACAI IS GREAT, I LOVE IT, BUT THE BOWL IS A LOT OF SUGAR -- RACHEL: JUST SAY WHAT YOU SAID IN THE COMMERCIAL BREAK, YOU MIGHT AS WELL --  YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST GLUE THE BOWL RIGHT TO YOUR RUMP LIKE THIS. [LAUGHTER] BECAUSE I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S A GREAT PRODUCT, ACAI -- WILL: GOING TO PRETEND LIKE CHICK-FIL-A --  DEFINITELY CHICK-FIL-A. I'M A BIG -- PETE: ALWAYS FOR THE WIN.  I I EAT THE HELL OUT OF SOME CHICK-FIL-A. PETE: WHO DO YOU HAVE ON THE SHOW TONIGHTSOME.  I GOT GUY, PETE HEGSETH, HE'S A VERY STRANGE CAT. JESSE WATTERS, AN FBI AGENT AND, PLEASE, PLEASE LISTEN TO MY MONOLOGUE TONIGHT. THIS IS TOTALLY UNFILTERED, THERE IS ZERO PROMPTER BECAUSE I DIDN'T NEED IT. IT IS ABOUT THIS DISGUSTING, FILTHY WAR ON OUR KIDS WITH THIS BALENCIAGA STUFF AND THE RESPONSE TO IT. AND I GO ABSOLUTELY DEF CON NUCLEAR ON THIS STUFF BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T LINK WELCOME BACK SHIELDS TO PROTECT OUR KIDS -- LINK SHIELDS TO PROTECT OUR KIDS, IT'S JUST A LAND MASS OF PEOPLE 45 SERVES NO FUNCTION WHATSOEVER. RAY RAE THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. IT'S A WAR ON THEIR INNOCENCE.  DISGUSTING. WILL: UNBELIEVABLE.  IT'S NOT JUST THE STORY, IT'S THE RESPONSE TO IT ON THE LEFT, BLAMING QANON, ALYSSA GRIFFIN, WHATEVER, ON THE VIEW TALKING ABOUT REPUBLICANS POUNCE. REALLY? REALLY, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? THESE ARE KIDS IN A BONDAGE AD -- RACHEL: AND SHE'S ONE OF THOSE PARENTS. WHO ARE THOSE PARENTS?  NUTS. PLEASE DON'T MISS IT. WILL: ALL RIGHT. A BIT OF A TURN, WHAT BETTER PLACE TO WATCH TODAY'S USA GAME AGAINST THE NETHERLANDS AND HOLLAND AND DUTCH? WE'RE GOING TO TAKE 'EM ALL THREE ON. [LAUGHTER] FIGURE THAT OUT, LET'S GO TO THE BAR. MAYBE THEY'LL TELL US WHAT ALL THREE OF THOSE ARE. ARE THEY THE SAME THING? [LAUGHTER]  ALL RIGHT. SEE YOU, GUYS. PETE: RACHEL AND I WILL ARE HOLD IT DOWN.  HOLD DOWN THE FORT. PETE: WE DIDN'T GET AN INVITE TO THE BAR. \u266a \u266a THIS IS OUR DESTINY \u266a RACHEL: WELCOME BACK. WE HAVE A FOX WEATHER ALERT ARE. LAVA PROSECUTE WORLD'S LARGEST ACTIVE VOLCANO KNOW IS CREEPING CLOSER TO A MAJOR HIGHWAY, THE VOLCANO KNOW RUTTING LAST SUNDAY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ALMOST 40 YEARS. FOX WEATHER CORRESPONDENT MAX GOURDEN IS IN HAWAII WITH MORE. GOOD MORNING.  Reporter: WELL, THE FLOW HAS SLOWED DOWN CONSIDERABLY EVER SINCE IT HIT FLATTER GROUND. IT'S MOVING ABOUT 150 FEET PER HOUR X THAT LAST UPDATE FROM OFFICIALS IT WAS LESS THAN 3 MILES AWAY FROM THE MAIN EAST-WEST HIGHWAY. THAT HIGHWAY STILL REMAINS OPEN AT THIS HOUR. MAUNA LOA FIRST STARTED ERUPTING ON SUNDAY, THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1984. THIS IS THE LARGEST ACTIVE VOLCANO KNOW IN THE WORLD. SINCE THEN LAVA HAS BEEN SPEWING FROM THE VOLCANO KNOW DRAWING VISITORS AND LOCALS TO SEE THE AWE-INSPIRING GLOW. SAD TO SAY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THIS ERUPTION WILL LAST. CURRENTLY VOLCANIC SMOG IS A CONCERN FOR FOLKS HERE, CAUSED BY THE GASES EMITTED FROM THE VOLCANO KNOW AND POTENTIALLY BE HARMFUL. OFFICIALS ARE MONITORING AIR QUALITY LEVELS. AND WHILE THE HIGHWAY COULD EVENTUALLY BE IN THE PATH OF THE LAVA, NO EVACUATION ORDERS NEEDED TO BE ISSUED, AND NO HOMES ARE CURRENTLY THREATENED, A RELIEF TO HAWAII'S MAYOR WHO SAID HE INITIALLY HAD CONCERNS WHEN THE VOLCANO BEGAN ERUPTING.  THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF FEAR FOR A LOT OF OUR RESIDENTS THAT LIVE DOWN SLOPE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF WHERE IT'S COMING. BUT SEEING WHERE IT'S THE AT NOW, I JUST FEEL RELIEVED THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE JEOPARDIZING ANYBODY'S HOMES, PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO, YOU KNOW, GO ABOUT THEIR BUSINESS.  Reporter: IF THE MAYOR SAYS THEY HAVE PLANS TO SHUT DOWN THE HIGHWAY IF THE LAVA COMES TOO CLOSE, AND IF IT BECOMES OVERRUN, THEY'LL USE HEAVY MACHINERY TO CLEAR AWAY THE ROCK OR THEY'LL JUST BUILD NEW HIGHWAY RIGHT OP ON OVER IT. BACK TO YOU. RACHEL: ALL RIGHT, MAX, THANK YOU. THOSE IMAGES ARE AMAZING. YOU CAN FOLLOW THIS STORY AND ALL THE LATEST WEATHER DEVELOPMENTS BY DOWNLOADING THE FOX WEATHER APP TO ANY OF YOUR CONNECTED DEVICES. PETE? PETE: THANK YOU, RACHEL. I'M STILL NOT OVER IT, WE'RE HERE AND WILL'S AT A BAR. ALL RIGHT, A NEW REPORT FROM COLLEGE FIX FOUND NEARLY 50% OF DEPARTMENTS, GET THIS, 50% OF DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THESE 7 MAJOR UNIVERSITY WITHS -- OHIO STATE, YOU KNOW, UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA -- HAVE NO REGISTERED REPUBLICAN PROFESSORS. AND 92 THE % OF EDUCATORS -- 92% OF EDUCATORS IDENTIFY AS DEMOCRATS, OUTNUMBERING ARE REPUBLICAN PROFESSORS # 1 TO 1. JOINS I -- JOINING US NOW IS VICTOR DAVIS HANSEN. VICTOR, IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE LISTING OUT THE IVY LEAGUE HERE. NOT THAT IT MATTERS, BUT OHIO STATE, NEBRASKA, NORTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, CORNELL, OKLAHOMA, ALASKA-ANCHORAGE, ZERO REPUBLICANS THERE.  YEAH, THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY DISTURBING. AS YOU SAY, IT'S NOT STANFORD, YALE, HARVARD WHERE WE EXPECT THAT. THESE ARE CONSERVATIVE STATES, AND THESE USED TO BE NEUTRAL INSTITUTIONS, BUT THEY'VE BEEN TAKEN OVER. AND WHAT'S ALSO DISTURBING, IT WASN'T JUST ENGLISH AND HISTORY, THE ECONOMICS DEPARTMENT AS WELL. AND THE QUESTION IS WHY IS IT HAPPENING, AND EVEN MORE DISTURBING IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE SAY DEMOCRAT VERSUS REPUBLICAN AND THE POLLS PROBE FURTHER, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT REPUBLICAN, 75% OF THEM IDENTIFY AS COMMUNIST, SOCIALIST OR MARXIST. [LAUGHTER] PETE: GREAT.  THEY'RE NOT BILL CLINTON DEMOCRATS, SO IT'S PRETTY SCARY. SO WHAT HAPPENED? WE ALL KNEW WHEN YOU GIVE PEOPLE LIFETIME APPOINTMENT WITH TENURE AND NO ACCOUNTABILITY, IT ENDS UP IN UTOPIA. BUT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT THE LAST, OH, 10 YEARS, ESPECIALLY THE LAST 3. MOST OF THESE UNIVERSITIES ARE NOT REQUIRING S.A.T. OR A.C.T.MENTs AS THEY USED TO. THE GRADES HAVE BEEN INFLATED, THE TEACHING LOADS HAVE BEEN REDUCED, AND A LOT OF PROFESSORS SEE A LOT OF NEW STUDENTS COMING IN THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ADMITTED, BUT THEY'RE VERY IDEOLOGICAL. AND THE COURSES ARE THERAPEUTIC, IDEOLOGICAL, THEY'RE POLITICAL. IT'S MUCH EASIER TO TEACH THOSE KIND OF COURSES THAN THE ENLIGHTENMENT OR THE RENAISSANCE OR CALCULUS. AND SO I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THE PROFESSORS ARE SAYING, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'VE GOT A LOT OF MOTIVATED POLITICAL STUDENTS, WE HAVE FEWER AND FEWER STANDARDS. I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE C OR Bs OR As, I MEAN -- PETE: YEAH. GO ALONG TO GET ALONG.  YEAH. AND I'M GONNA DO IT. SO WHAT THEY DO IS THEY TAKE OUT INDEMNITY INSURANCE AND SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M NOT GOING TO BE CLASSICAL LIBERAL ANYMORE, I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE STANDARDS BECAUSE IT'S EASIER FOR ME. I DON'T WANT THE DIVERSITY, EQUITY, INCLUSION CZAR DOWN MY BACK, I DON'T WANT TO REFUSE TO TAKE THAT LOYALTY OATH, DIVERSITY, INCLUSION, EQUITY OATH -- PETE: YEAH.  -- AND THEY JUST TAKE OUT INSURANCE AND SAY, HEY, I'M VERY HARD LEFTIST. AND THEY LIVE, A LOT OF THESE FACULTY MEMBERS LIVE LIVES OF QUIET DESPERATION, THEY MOUTH ALL THIS STUFF AND GO HOME AND CLINCH THEIR TEETH AND SAY, MY GOD, THIS STUFF IS CRAZY. IT'S STALINIST, BUT THEY WON'T BUCK IT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES -- PETE: THEIR JOB WOULD BE AT STAKE.  AND THESE ARE NOT MA OWE SALVO -- MARIO SALVO FREE SPEECH LISTISTS OF THE '60s -- LEFTISTS OF THE '60s, THEY'RE STALINISTS. PEACE AND LOVE, FREE SPEECH, THEY DON'T BELIEVE THAT. THEY'RE DETERMINED REVOLUTIONARIES. PETE: WELL, NOW I'M DEPRESSED. I MEAN, WE KNEW HIGHER EDUCATION WAS LIBERAL. YOU'RE SAYING IT'S STILL ACCELERATING, AND IT'S NOT JUST HARVARD, IT'S OHIO STATE, NEBRASKA, GEORGIA, YOUR ALMA MATER, MY ALMA MATER, OTHERS INFECTED WITH THIS DISEASE. VICTOR DAVIS HANSEN, NOBODY DOES IT BETTER, THANK YOU,S SIR.  THANK YOU. PETE: BACK TO RAE CHEL WHO'S STILL NOT IN A BAR TO RAISE SOME HEADLINES. RACHEL: PETE, WE HAVE A COCKTAIL SEGMENT COMING UP, SO THAT'LL HELP. ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO SOME HEADLINES, A DISNEY WORLD FAVORITE IS HEADED FOR RETIREMENT. THE ICONIC SPLASH MOUNTAIN IN MAGIC KINGDOM, WHICH I LOVE, WILL CLOSE PERMANENTLY ON JANUARY 23RD AFTER 30 YEARS. DISNEY WILL REPLACE IT WITH A RIDE BASED ON THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG. THE CLOSURE FOLLOWS COMPLAINTS AGAINST DISNEY THAT IT'S BASED ON THE MOVIE SONG OF THE SOUTH ANDED HAD RACIST OVERTONES. > PRINCE AND PRINCESS WHOSOME BOSTON CELTICS COACH JOE MA ASSUME LA DIDN'T SEEM TOO IMPRESSED WITH THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS OF WALES. WHEN A REPORTER ASKED HIM IF HE GOT TO MEET THE ROYAL FAMILY, HE REPLIED JESUS, MARY AND JOSEPH? OH, NO, I DID NOT. I'M ONLY FAMILIAR WITH ONE ROYAL FAMILY. I DO NOT KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT ONE, WHICH WAS AN AMAZING RESPONSE. AND THOSE ARE YOUR HEADLINES. ALL RIGHT. COMING UP ON TOMORROW'S SHOW, JUDGE JEANINE PIRRO, MARIA BARTIROMO, JANICE DEAN AND MORE. BUT FIRST FROM PEPPERER MINT -- PEPPERMINT-TINIS, WE'RE MAKING YOUR SPIRITS BRIGHT WITH. PETE'S ALREADY GOING FOR IT. \u266a \u266a 20221203145303.745|20221203145441.042",

        "trs": " Tucker: SO WHAT YOU DON'T WANT TO DO WHEN YOU'RE COVERING THE PELOSI FAMILY IS TELL THE TRUTH. NBC NEWS REPORTER MIGUEL ALMAGAR APPARENTLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT. HE DID REAL JOURNALISM ON THE ATTACK ON PAUL PELOSI, AND HE'S SINCE VANISHED FROM THE AIR. WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM? TRACE GALLAGHER JOINS US WITH MORE.  HE'S BASED IN LOS ANGELES, JUST LIKE ME, IF YOU WATCH \"NIGHTLY NEWS,\" \"THE TODAY SHOW,\" HE WAS ON THE AIR ALL THE TIME. NOW HE'S BEEN OFF ALMOST A MONTH. HE WAS SUSPENDED WITHOUT EXPLANATION IN EARLY NOVEMBER. HE'S BEEN OFF SOCIAL MEDIA, EXCEPT FOR POSTING A FEW VACATION PICTURES. SO FAR, ALMAGAR, NBC, HIS AGENT, HAVE ISSUED A STATEMENT ON WHY HE LEFT, WHEN HE COMES BACK, IF HE COMES BACK. IT'S A SUSPENSION BEING HANDLED LIKELY WITNESS PROTECTION. HERE'S THE THING, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE REPORT HE FILED ON PAUL PELOSI, BECAUSE NOBODY WILL TELL US. ALL WE KNOW FOR SURE IT GOES AGAINST THE COMMON NARRATIVE, SPECIFICALLY CHALLENGING WHETHER PAUL PELOSI WAS IN DANGER WHEN POLICE ARRIVED. WATCH.  AV A KNOCK AND ANNOUNCE, THE FRONT DOOR WAS OPENED BY MR. PELOSI. THE 82-YEAR-OLD DID NOT IMMEDIATELY DECLARE AN EMERGENCY OR TRY TO LEAVE HIS HOME, BUT INSTEAD BEGAN WALKING SEVERAL FEET BACK INTO THE FOYER, TOWARD THE ASSAILANT, AND AWAY FROM POLICE.  BUT THE SAME DETAILS HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY NBC'S LOCAL AFFILIATE IN SAN FRANCISCO, AND LOCAL NBC FORCES TELL FOX DIGITAL THEY BELIEVE ALMAGAR HAD DIFFERENT SOURCE THAT OFFERED THE SAME INFORMATION. REMEMBER, ALMAGAR DIDN'T JUST RIGHT A CONTROVERSIAL STORY AND HAVE IT EDITED WITHOUT THE BRASS AT NBC SIGNING OFF ON IT. SOMEONE LIKELY APPROVED THE STORY, AND SEVERAL PEOPLE APPROVED IT, AND JUST AS LIKELY SEVERAL PEOPLE HAVE SIGNED OFF ON SAYING NOTHING. TUCKER?  Tucker: HA-HA-HA! SPOKEN LIKE A MAN WHO KNOWS TELEVISION. THE GREAT TRACE GALLAGHER, AVAILABLE FOR A FULL HOUR, \"FOX NEWS AT NIGHT,\" MIDNIGHT EVERY NIGHT EASTERN TIME. OF ALL PROFESSIONAL SPORTS, THE NHL, HOCKEY, PROBABLY HAS THE MOST CONSERVATIVE FAN BASE. AND OWNERS. MORE THAN 75% OF NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE OWNERS DONATE TO REPUBLICANS. THE OWNER OF THE L.A. KING IS A MEGA DONOR TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD -- AR MAYBE IT'S NOT WEIRD AT ALL -- THAT THE NHL HAS DECIDED TO PUSH WOKE PROPAGANDA ON ITS FANS. GARY BETTMAN AND LEAGUE VICE PRESIDENT KIM DAVIS SAY THEY WANT FEWER WHITE PEOPLE PLAYING HOCKEY.  LOOKING AT THE HOCKEY LANDSCAPE IN FIVE YEARS, WHAT DOES PROGRESS LOOK LIKE TO BOTH OF YOU, COMMISSIONER BETTMAN?  TO ME, PROGRESS LOOKS LIKE THAT WE BECOME MORE REFLECTIVE OF THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH OUR TEAMS PLAY, THAT THERE ARE MORE BLACK PLAYERS OF BOTH S EXES, PLAYERS OF BOTH COLORS OF BOTH SEXES AND WE'RE MORE DIVERSE THAN WE'VE BEEN.  FIVE YEARS FROM NOW, I WANT HOCKEY TO BE ON THE LIPS OF BOYS AND GIRLS OF COLOR, JUST THE WAY SOCCER AND BASKETBALL AND BASEBALL IS ON THEIR LIPS. SOMETHING THAT THEY SEE AS ACCESSIBLE.  Tucker: SO ATTACKING WHITE PEOPLE. OKAY? I GUESS THAT'S COMMON. YOU DON'T NOTICE  IT. IT'S TOTALLY IMMORAL, BUT IT HAPPENS. THEN IT GETS MORE ESOTERIC. \"TRANSWOMEN ARE TRANSWOMEN, TRANSMEN ARE MEN.\" THEO FLEURY IS A HOCKEY LEGEND IN CANADA AND IN THE UNITED STATES. HE PLAYED IN THE LEAGUE FOR A LONG TIME, MOST OF HIS NIGHT. HE JOINS US TONIGHT. THEO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS? WERE RACE POLITICS A BIG PART OF HOCKEY WHEN YOU WERE PLAYING?  NO. GOD NO. YOU KNOW, I THINK THE REASON WHY WE ALL GRAVITATED TOWARD HOCKEY WAS FIRST AND FOREMOST IT WAS FUN. THEN SECONDLY, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS NO POLITICS INVOLVED. YOU KNOW, WE PLAYED THIS SPORT BECAUSE WE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. FOR ME PERSONALLY IT WAS AN ESCAPE FROM WHAT WAS GOING ON IN MY HOME LIFE AT THAT TIME. YOU KNOW, I FELL HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE WITH THE SPORT. YOU KNOW, I WAS REALLY GOOD AT IT OBVIOUS, AND PURSUED A CAREER IN THIS AMAZING GAME THAT WE PLAY.  Tucker: SO CLEARLY, YOU KNOW, POLITICAL FORCES HIJACK PROFESSIONAL SPORTS AS A WAY TO BRAINWASH THE YOUNG MEN WHO WATCH PROFESSIONAL SPORTS. THAT'S THE ENTIRE POINT OF IT. STRATEGIC. WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY SAY BACK OFF?  WELL, I THINK IT'S A REALLY -- BECAUSE WE'RE SO DIVIDED, TUCKER, AND DEEP DOWN HOCKEY PLAYERS ARE, YOU KNOW, GUYS WHO ARE COMPASSIONATE AND EMPATHETIC, SOMETHING WE DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN. IT'S AN ARGUMENT THAT WE CAN'T WIN, YOU KNOW. SO THE REASON WHY -- YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T MATTER TO US WHO PLAYS THE SPORT, WHETHER YOU'RE TRANSGENDER, GAY OR WHATEVER. THE REASON WHY WE PLAY THE GAME, THE REASON WHY THE GAME IS SO AMAZING AND SO GREAT, IS IT'S FOR EVERYBODY. RIGHT? THE REASON WHY WE PLAY THE GAME IS IT'S AN ESCAPE FROM WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR LIVES.  Tucker: EXACTLY.  UNFORTUNATELY POLITICS HAS NO PLACE IN ANY SPORT, WHETHER THAT'S FOOTBALL, BASKETBALL, HOCKEY, BASEBALL. POLITICS SHOULD NEVER BE A PART OF ANY KIND OF SPORT WHATSOEVER.  Tucker: OF COURSE NOT. BY THE WAY, IF THEY WERE CALLING FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN THE NBA, I'D BE TOTALLY OPPOSED TO THAT. BUT THEY NEVER WILL. THEO FLEURY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THANK YOU, TUCKER.  Tucker: SO A FEW WEEKS AGO WE INTRODUCED TO YOU A PRO-LIFE SPIDER-MAN WHO SCALES SKYSCRAPERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY TO CALL ATTENTION TO HIS BELIEFS. HE WAS JUST ARRESTED. HE'S OUT OF JAIL. AND FREE TO JOIN US, AND HE'S GOING TO, NEXT.  Tucker: TURNS OUT WHEN YOU DEGRADE AND DEMORALIZE INSTITUTION, AS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS, PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO WORK THERE ANYMORE. THAT'S TRUE OF POLICE DEPARTMENTS. THAT'S TRUE OF THE U.S. MILITARY. IT'S ALSO TRUE OF THE BORDER PATROL. AS A RESULT, THE BORDER PATROL IS RUNNING OUT OF BORDER PATROL OFFICERS. TO FIX THE SHORTAGE, FEDERAL AIR MARSHALS ARE BEING DEPLOYED TO THE SOUTHERN BORDER. THEY'RE NEEDED ON AIRPLANES. DOZENS OF MARSHALS DON'T WANT TO LEAVE FLIGHTS. WHY WOULD THEY? IT'S THEIR JOB TO PROTECT FLIGHTS, NOT THE BORDER. DON'T WE HAVE A MILITARY FOR THAT? WHY IS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TRYING TO ORDER AIR MARSHALS TO THE BORDER LIKE WE DON'T HAVE A NATIONAL GUARD?  THE BOTTOM LINE IS THEY'RE DESPERATE. THEY DO NOT WANT TO DECLARE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY ON THE BORDER, SO THEY THINK THEY'RE SECRETLY GOING TO SNEAK AIR MARSHALS OFF THE PLANES, AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE QUIET ABOUT IT. WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT THIS. WE DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED ON 9/11. FOUR AIRCRAFT WERE TAKEN IN A MATTER OF MOMENTS. 2,977 PEOPLE WERE MURDERED. 6,000 INJURED IN A MATTER OF MINUTES. WE'RE GOING TO SUPPLEMENT THE BORDER PATROL. WE'RE HIGHLY SKILLED, OPERATING 35,000 FEET AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE, MAY HAVE TO UTILIZE DEADLY FORCE. THESE JOBS ARE EASILY BACKFILLED WITH NGOs OR CONTRACTORS. I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY'RE TRYING TO PULL THE AIR MARSHALS OUT OF OUR SKIES. AND WE'RE AT THE BUSIEST TIME OF THE SEASON FOR TRAVEL.  Tucker: THEY COULD SEND THE NATIONAL GUARD IN. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ADMITTING THEY'RE DOING THIS? IS THIS HAPPENING IN SECRET?  THEY ARE ADMITTING THEY'RE DOING IT, BUT WON'T DECLARE A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. DHS SECRETARY , YOU'RE MAKING OR SKIES NOT SECURE.  Tucker: A LOT OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA ARE PRO-CHOICE, PRO-CHOICE, BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS SIGNED UP FOR THE FULL PRO-CHOICE PROGRAM. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY, PRO-CHOICE? A NUMBER OF STATES, INCLUDING CALIFORNIA, HAVE LEGAL ABORTION UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. WHO IS T FOR THAT? UP UNTIL THE MOMENT OF BIRTH, REALLY? THAT'S MURDER. TO DRAW ATTENTION A 23-YEAR-OLD MAN DECIDED TO CLIMB SKYSCRAPERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, FREE-CLIMBING WITHOUT A ROPE OR HARNESS, PRO-LIFE SPIDER-MAN. HE'S SCALED HUGE BUILDINGS. YESTERDAY HE CLIMBED THE 54-STORY RITZ-CARLTON TOWER IN LOS ANGELES.  HE'S SCALING THE BUILDING, CLIMBING 54 FLOORS UP WITH CLIMBING CHALK, BUT NO ROPE, TO TAKE A STAND ONCE AGAIN. THE 22-YEAR-OLD IS PRO-LIFE AND LEFT A SIGN ON THE SIDE OF THE RITZ CARLSON IN SUPPORT.  Tucker: PRO-LIFE SPIDER-MAN WAS PROMPTLY ARRESTED, THE POLICE ACCUSED HIM OF SUFFERING FROM A MENTAL ILLNESS. HE'S OUT OF JAIL THANKFULLY AND JOINS US TONIGHT. MASON, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. LOOKING AT THOSE PICTURES, YOU KNOW, ARE YOU AFRAID? I HAVE TO ASK THE OBVIOUS QUESTION. THAT LOOKED LEGIT TERRIFYING.  YEAH. TUCKER, WE'RE SEEING SO MANY PEOPLE LIVE THEIR LIVES IN FEAR, CHRISTIANS INCLUDED, BUT WE'RE NOT CALLED TO LIVE OUR LIVES IN FEAR. WE'RE CALLED TO LIVE OUR LIVES IN FAITH. AT CONCEPTION, BABIES IN THE WOMB HAVE THEIR OWN UNIQUE DNA SEPARATE FROM THE MOTHER. WE NEED TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING, REGARDLESS OF THE BACKLASH OR CONSEQUENCES. I GET CALLED A RADICAL, BUT THE MOST RADICAL THING YOU CAN DO IN THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT IS TO DO NOTHING.  Tucker: YEAH. SO YOU'RE MENTALLY ILL NOW, I GUESS, IS WHAT THEY'RE SAYING? IT DOES SEEM LIKE A HANDY CATCHALL DISMISSAL FOR PEOPLE WHOSE VIEWS WE DON'T LIKE, I'VE NOTICED. DO YOU FEEL YOU'RE MENTALLY IMBALANCED?  I STOPPED TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT I'M NOT CRAZY. HA-HA. YOU KNOW, I'M DOING THIS TO RAISE MONEY FOR WOMEN WHO REALLY NEED HELP, WOMEN THAT ARE IN A CRISIS PREGNANCY. YOU'RE SEEING STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA ISSUE PROPOSITION 1, WHICH LEGALIZEDS ELECTIVE ABORTION UP UNTIL BIRTH. I CLIMB THESE BUILDINGS TO RAISE MONEY FOR AN ORGANIZATION CALLED LET THEM LIVE AND SHOW THESE STATES WHAT LOVING THY NEIGHBOR REALLY MEANS. IT DOESN'T MEAN KILLING YOUR CHILD. IT MEANS SUPPORTING THEM THROUGH ACTS OF CHARITY AND PROVIDING THINGS LIKE JOB COUNSELING AND HELP WITH THEIR BILLS SO THEY CAN GET BACK ON THEIR FEET.  Tucker: WELL, THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT. I MEAN, AGAIN, ALWAYS TRY TO BE-MINDED. A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE DESCRIBE THEMSELVES AS PRO-CHOICE, BUT IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT WOMEN, WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO SUPPORT WOMEN WHO DON'T WANT TO HAVE AN ABORTION? THEY'D PROBABLY LIKE ANOTHER OPTION, BUT THEY DON'T. WHY DON'T MORE PEOPLE SUPPORT THOSE OPTIONS, I WONDER.  WELL, I REALLY DO THINK WE HAVE A CULTURE OF MURDER. I THINK THAT THESE PEOPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT THESE WOMEN. THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR AGENDA, WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PUSH. THEY WANT LESS PEOPLE -- THE LESS PEOPLE ON THE EARTH THE LESS PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE TO SHOW LOVE TO.  Tucker: LAST QUESTION. HOW DID YOU GET ARRESTED? WERE THEY WAITING FOR YOU AT THE TOP? DID THEY TAKE YOU TO JAIL?  YEAH. YOU KNOW, THEY -- THEY ALWAYS WAIT FOR ME AT THE TOP. I GET TO THE TOP. THEY'RE ALWAYS SLIGHTLY IMPRESSED. I TELL THEM WHAT I'M DOING. THIS TIME I'M CLIMBING TO HELP A SPECIFIC MOTHER NAMED OLIVIA. WE'RE TRYING TO RAISE $50,000 TO HELP HER AND OTHER WOMEN IN A CRISIS PREGNANCY AT LETTHEMLIVE.ORG. HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN, AND I ACCOMPLISHED THE MISSION.  Tucker: MOST OF US DO THE THANKSGIVING TURKEY TROT FOR CHARITY. WE'RE NOT CLIMBING A TOWER WITH NO ROPES. DON'T FALL. MASON, THANK YOU.  YEAH. THANK YOU. TUCKER, THE OFFER STILL STANDS IF YOU WANT TO COME ROPE CLIMBING. I'LL BE YOUR ROPE GUN.  Tucker: NO WAY, MAN. BUT I ADMIRE YOU. THANK YOU.  YEAH, THANK YOU.  Tucker: SO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN TELLING YOU CONTRADICTORY THINGS, BUT FOR A WHILE THEY'VE BEEN TELLING YOU TO GET A COVID SHOT EVERY YEAR. NOW THE HHS SECRETARY IS TELLING YOU YOU NEED TO GET A NEW SHOT EVERY TWO MONTHS. THINK ABOUT THAT. CAN YOU IMAGINE ANYTHING MORE IRRESPONSIBLE THAN THAT? EVERY TWO MONTHS. OKAY. WE'VE GOT DETAILS STRAIGHT AHEAD. 20221201014450.168|20221201014845.637",

        "trs": "\u266a  Laura: WE MIGHT FINALLY GET A PEEK INTO WHAT WAS REALLY GOING ON AT TWITTER AHEAD OF THE 2020 ELECTION. ELON MUSK HAS PROMISED SPA SUFFIX ABOUT HOW HIS PREDECESSORS AT TWITTER OPPOSED CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL VIEWS. CASE IN POINT HOW THEY BURIED THE NEW YORK POST HUNTER BIDEN STORY. JOINING ME IS MIRANDA DEVINE NEW YORK POST, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND AUTHOR OF LAP BOOK FROM HELL. WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT THESE FILES ELON HAS PROMISED TO RELEASE MIGHT INCLUDE?  HI, LAURA. WE KNOW FROM WHAT FACEBOOK HAS TOLD US OR MARK ZUCKERBERG HAS REVEALED THAT THE FBI WENT TO FACEBOOK SHORTLY BEFORE THEY CENSORED OUR STORY BEFORE IT WAS PUBLISHED. THE FBI WENT WITH VERY SPECIFIC DETAILS AND TOLD FACEBOOK WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR, THIS DUMP OF RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION THAT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE THE STORY THAT WE ENDED UP PUBLISHING WHICH, OF COURSE, HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RUSSIA AND WAS ACCURATE AND TRUE. AND SO TWITTER COPIED FACEBOOK WITHIN AN HOUR OF THEIR CENSORING OUR STORY, TWITTER FOLLOWED SUIT. AND, IN FACT, TWITTER WENT FURTHER AND BASICALLY CANCELLED OUR ACCOUNT OR LOCKED OUR ACCOUNT FOR TWO WEEKS. AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE OLDEST UP IN IN THE COUNTRY. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FOURTH LARGEST BY CIRCULATION. IT'S NO SMALL MATTER. TWITTER'S THEN OWNER JACK DORSEY DID LATER APOLOGIZE, SAID IT WAS A MISTAKE AND SAID THAT THEY WERE INCORRECT WHEN THEY ACCUSED US OF HAVING PUBLISHED HACKED MATERIALS. BUT WHY DID THEY DO THAT? WHY WERE THEY OPERATING IN CONCERT WITH FACEBOOK? DID THEY GET THE SAME SORT OF BRIEFING, BOGUS, DISHONEST BRIEFING FROM THE FBI? AND THE FBI WE KNOW, OF COURSE, AT THE TIME HAD BEEN SPYING ON RUDY GIULIANI, SO HAD INSIDE KNOWLEDGE OF WHEN THE POST WAS GOING TO PUBLIC OUR STORY AND EXACTLY WHAT WAS IN IT, AND WHAT GIULIANI HAD BEEN TOLD BY THE LAPTOP REPAIR SHOP OWNER.  Laura: A LOT OF THIS SEEMS LIKE ELECTION METTLING TO ME. IF YOU'RE SUPPRESSING A STORY THAT SOME PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS WERE INTERESTED IN AND COULD HAVE AFFECTED THEIR VOTE, WHAT IS THAT? I MEAN, THEY'RE ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT ELECTION METTLING, RUSSIAN ELECTION METTLING. WHAT DID THEY DO?  DOMESTIC ELECTION INTERFERENCE, ABSOLUTELY. AND I THINK WHAT ELON MUSK CAN HELP US WITH, BECAUSE MARK ZUCKERBERG HAS JUST CLAMMED UP WHEN HE TOLD JOE ROGEN BRIEFLY, HE REFUSES TO ANSWER ANYMORE QUESTIONS THAT I'VE PUT TO FACEBOOK. I THINK WHAT ELON MUSK CAN TELL US, ALTHOUGH HE'S NOT RESPONDING TO MY E-MAILS, IS, WAS THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN INVOLVED? WAS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY INVOLVED IN THAT DECISION TO CENSOR TWITTER? WHO WERE THE PERSONNEL AT TWITTER WHO DECIDED TO DO THAT? WHAT CONNECTIONS DID THEY HAVE WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY? WE NEED TO KNOW THAT. THIS IS REALLY AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT -- I MEAN, ELON MUSK TALKS ABOUT IT AS BEING IMPORTANT TO RESTORE PUBLIC TRUST IN TWITTER. I THINK IT'S BIGGER THAN THAT. AND HE DOES ADMIT THAT, THAT TWITTER IS AT THE MOMENT IN THIS EXISTENTIAL BATTLE BETWEEN TYRANNY AND FREEDOM. HE'S ACTUALLY SAID SO MUCH.  Laura: ALL RIGHT, MIRANDA, GREAT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. THANK YOU  NOW IS THE GOP FIGHTING HARD ENOUGH IN THAT GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFF RACE? WELL, RIGHT NOW THE GOP IS GETTING OUTSPENT BIG TIME. ACCORDING TO NBC ON TELEVISION, RADIO AND ONLINE, DEMOCRATS SUPPORTING RAPHAEL WARNOCK HAVE SPENT TWICE AS MUCH AS REPUBLICANS HAVE WALKER. WHY IS THAT? AND THEIR BIG STARS ARE COMING OUT ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE AS WELL, FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WILL CAMPAIGN WITH WARNOCK THIS WEEKEND. WHILE THE UBER POPULAR MICHELLE OBAMA HAS ALREADY RECORDED ROBOCALLS. AND IN CASE REPUBLICANS NEEDED REMINDING POLITICO LAYS IT OUT IN STARK TERMS. IF RAPHAEL WARNOCK WINS IN GEORGIA NEXT WEEK THEY'LL CLAIM A REMAJORITY. JOINING ME NOW SENATE CANDIDATE HERSCHEL WALKER. HERSCHEL, WE SIT HERE ONE WEEK OUT FROM THIS SPECIAL ELECTION. HOW ARE YOU FEELING GIVEN WE'VE LEARNED 180,000 VOTES, A RECORD NUMBER IN AN ELECTION LIKE THIS, HAVE ALREADY BEEN CAST?  WELL, I FEEL PRETTY GOOD. I FEEL THAT RIGHT NOW THE PEOPLE ARE HAVING THEIR VOTE COUNTED AND THEIR VOICES HEARD. AND YOU TALK ABOUT VOTER SUPPRESSION, I DON'T THINK THEY GOT THAT HERE. I THINK THE PEOPLE ARE UPSET. THEY'RE UPSET AT RAPHAEL WARNOCK AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE SURPRISED. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY, YOU MENTIONED IT. THEY'RE SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY, THEY HAVE THE FORMER PRESIDENT COMING IN, THE FORMER FIRST LADY RECORDING MESSAGES FOR HIM. AND I SAID IT MANY TIME. THEY'RE GOING TO OUTRAISE US IN MONEY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO MESSAGING. HOW CAN THEY TALK ABOUT HAVING AN OPEN BORDER? HOW CAN THEY TALK ABOUT A TERRIBLE ECONOMY? HOW CAN THEY TALK ABOUT CRIME ON THE STREET? SO THEIR MESSAGES AREN'T ALIGNED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALIGNED TO THE GEORGIA PEOPLE. THAT'S THEIR MESSAGING. I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO TO TEAM HERSCHEL.COM BECAUSE I'M GOING TO CHANGE THIS.  Laura: HERSCHEL WHY IS IT AT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT COMING TO HAVE A RALLY IN THIS LAST WEEK BEFORE THE FINAL ELECTION DAY? MEANWHILE YOU GOT OBAMA CAMPAIGNING WITH WARNOCK.  YOU KNOW, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN MY CORNER, HE'S STILL IN MY CORNER AND HE'S BEEN DOING OTHER THINGS FOR ME AND EVERYONE HAS BEEN DOING THINGS FOR ME. TONIGHT WE GOT OUT OF A FUNDRAISER WITH GOVERNOR KEMP THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WAS AT THE FUNDRAISER AND PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING JUST AS MUCH FOR ME. I THINK RIGHT NOW THE LEFT IS TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA COMING DOWN. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'VE GOT TO REMEMBER, PRESIDENT OBAMA IS A CELEBRITY AND THAT SEEMS TO BE WHERE RAPHAEL WARNOCK IS GETTING HIS MONEY FROM CELEBRITIES. HE'S NOT GOING TO WIN THIS RAISE. I TOLD PEOPLE BEFORE HE WON'T OUTRAISE ME IN MONEY BUT HE WON'T GET MORE VOTES THAN I'M GOING TO GET.  Laura: THE POLL I JUST SAW HAS YOU ALL TIED UP WHICH MEANS REPUBLICANS BETTER DOUBLE DOWN ON EVERYTHING THEY'RE DOING TO HELP YOU AND THAT MEANS McCONNELL, ALL THE TOP HOUSE MEMBERS, McCARTHY, RNC, THEY ALL NEED TO GET OUT THERE AND HIT THE TRAIL WITH YOU. I WANT TO PLAY A NEW AD THAT YOUR CAMPAIGN HAS JUST RELEASED FOR EVERYBODY. LET'S WATCH IT.  HERE'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN NOBODY'S WATCHING.  UH-HUH. AND WARNOCK THOUGHT NO ONE WAS WATCHING WHEN HIS EX-WIFE CALLED POLICE TO REPORT HIS ABUSE.  HE'S A GREAT ACTOR.  AND WARNOCK THOUGHT NO ONE WAS WATCHING WHEN HE EVICTED POOR PEOPLE FROM THEIR HOMES.  EVICTED FOR $119. TREAT ME LIKE [BLEEP].  Laura: HERSCHEL DO YOU THINK GEORGIANS ARE GOING TO SEE THROUGH RAPHAEL WARNOCK'S ACT HERE IN THE FINAL HOURS?  WELL, I THINK THEY SAW THROUGH HIM DURING THE DEBATE. I THINK AFTER THE DEBATE THEY SAW THAT HE WAS A SHEEP, HE WAS A WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING, HE WAS NOT WHAT HE CLAIMED TO BE, A MAN OF THE CLOTH. THAT ALSO HE VOTED AGAINST RELIGIOUS LIBERTIES. A MAN OF THE CLOTH VOTEDED THAT IF A BABY SURVIVES AN ABORTION, HE WOULD VOTE TO DENY THAT BABY MEDICAL CARE. A MAN OF THE CLOTH THAT ALSO HAS VOTED AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT AMERICA STANDS FOR. AND YET HE'S THINKING THAT HE'S DOING GOOD BY GEORGIA. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU HE'S NOT. HE VOTED AGAINST THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE. HE VOTED TO HAVE THIS OPEN BORDER. HE VOTED FOR CRIME IN THE STREETS. AND WE CAN'T HAVE SIX MORE YEARS OF THIS. AND THAT'S THE REASON I DECIDED TO RUN. THAT'S WHY I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET BEHIND ME BECAUSE I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR GEORGIA AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR AMERICA.  Laura: HERSCHEL, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. THANK YOU, GOOD LUCK. WE'RE GOING TO BE WATCHING THIS VERY CLOSELY  NOW, WE JUST GOT A LOOK AT WHAT BIDEN'S 2024 CAMPAIGN MIGHT LOOK LIKE. MOLLIE HEMINGWAY AND MONICA CROWLEY JOIN ME IN STUDIO NEXT WITH REACTION TO THAT. STAY THERE. > TOGETHER WITH THE HELL OF YOUR ELECTED LEADERS TODAY WE HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY TWO YEARS OF PROGRESS. WE PASSED THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. NOW, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT BUT WE DID SO MUCH NO ONE KNOWS THE EFFECT OF IT YET. IT'S JUST COMING INTO PLAY.  Laura: YOU HAVE TO LIVE THE BILL IN ORDER TO APPRECIATE IT. NOW, EXPECT TO HEAR A LOT OF THAT KIND OF USELESS INACCURATE OVER NEXT TWO YEARS. ACCORDING TO AXIOS BIDEN'S SPEECH IN MICHIGAN TODAY IS KIND OF A DRY RUN FOR WHAT'S TO COME IN HIS POTENTIAL 2024 RUN. APPARENT LIVE WHITE HOUSE ADVISORS SEE THE MIDTERM AS THE ULTIMATE VALIDATION THAT VOTERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT PROTECTING DEMOCRACY WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND GIVING BIDEN PASSING GRADES APPARENTLY ON THE ECONOMY BECAUSE ISN'T THE ECONOMY GREAT? THEY ALSO POINT OUT THAT BIDEN'S 2020 BUNKER STRATEGY WORKED LIKE A CHARM RELATING THAT AXIOS THAT AMERICANS SEEM UNBOTHERED BY HIS CONSTANT WEEKENDS AWAY IN DELAWARE OR CAMP DAVID. IN OTHER WORDS, WE CAN EXPECT BIDEN'S BASEMENT STRATEGY 2.0. JOINING ME NOW MOLLIE HEMINGWAY EDITOR AND CHIEF AT THE FEDERALIST AND FOX NEWS TRIP TORAN MONICA CROWLEY HOST OF THE MONICA CROWLEY PODCAST. JUST DAYS AFTER HIS 80TH THE OCTOBER JA NAIR GIANNIS THIS SAVE GAME HER A PLAYING THEY DON'T WANT TO SEEM LIKE A LAME DUCK.  THEY HAVE SOME REASON TO BE CONFIDENT THE STRATEGY DID WORK WELL, YOU HAD THE CORPORATE MEDIA RUNNING THE CAMPAIGN, BIDEN IN THE BASEMENT.  Laura: A PANDEMIC.  AND IN 2022 YOU HAD SIMILAR THINGS WITH THE MEDIA HELPING THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. BIDEN WASN'T ON THE BALLOT IN 2022 THOUGH AND SO RE-DOING THIS STRATEGY I THINK IS UNLIKELY TO WORK WHILE GIVEN THAT NOW PEOPLE HAVE SO MUCH AWARENESS OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE UNDER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. AND IT ONLY WORKS WELL FOR HIM TO RUN THE SAME TYPE OF CAMPAIGN IF YOU HAVE DRASTIC IMPROVEMENTS IN THE ECONOMY AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S PREDICTING THAT.  Laura: MONICA EARLIER TODAY BIDEN WAS ASKED -- ASKED EVERYONE FOR A BIT OF PATIENCE ON THE ECONOMY. WATCH.  WE CAN INCREASE PRODUCTION AND LOWER PRICES FOR AMERICAN CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES IN THE SHORT TERM WHILE ACCELERATE OUR INVESTMENT INTO A TRANSITION TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. WE'RE GOING TO DO THAT. WE'RE DOING IT. IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO GET INFLATION BACK TO NORMAL LEVELS AS WE KEEP THE JOB LEVELS RESILIENT.  Laura: MONICA IT'S GOING TO WORK.  NO' NOT GOING TO WORK. PATIENCE, THE MAN HAS BEEN IN OFFICE FOR TWO YEARS AND LOOK WHAT HE'S DONE, THE ECONOMY IS IN HISTORIC CATASTROPHE. WHEN DONALD TRUMP HANDED OFF THE ECONOMY TO JOE BIDEN IN 2021 HE HANDED ON THE FASTEST RECOVERY ON RECORD, INFLATION AT 1.4%. SO ALL OF THIS ECONOMIC CATASTROPHE WE ARE LIVING THROUGH NOW WITH ASTRONOMICAL INFLATION, HIGH GAS PRICES, SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS, NOW MAYBE A RAILROAD STRIKE, ALL OF THIS IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND UNIFIED DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS IN TERMS OF PUSHING SO MUCH MONEY DOWN INTO THE SYSTEM, CREATING THIS INFLATIONARY ENVIRONMENT THAT EVERY AMERICAN IS SUFFERING THROUGH RIGHT NOW. HE CANNOT TURN IT AROUND BECAUSE AS HE SAID RIGHT AFTER THE MIDTERMS LAURA HE'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE COURSE. HE'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE COURSE BECAUSE HE'S COMPLETELY COMMITTED TO WHAT OBAMA CALLED THE FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE NATION.  Laura: THEY CERTAINLY CAN'T CHANGE THEIR POLICIES. TODAY AFTER THE OATH KEEPERS VERDICT THAT THEY WERE SALIVATING OVER ALL AFTERNOON LONG AND INTO THE EVENING AT THE OTHER CABLES, DEMOCRAT CONGRESSMAN JAMIE RASKIN LEANED INTO ANOTHER KEY STRATEGY FOR THE DEMS IN 2024.  THE ELECTION THAT WE JUST CAME THROUGH WAS A VERY POSITIVE THING IN TERMS OF OF THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TRYING TO STAND UP FOR DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM AND THE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK, BUT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT DONALD TRUMP AND THE FORCES OF CHAOS AND VENDETTA AND AUTHORITARIANISM ARE STILL VERY MUCH OUT THERE.  Laura: MOLLIE THIS IS REPRESENTING AN ADMINISTRATION THAT REFUSES TO CONDEMN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CHINA, BUT APPARENTLY I GUESS ANY CROWD OF REPUBLICANS IS GOING TO BE AN INSURRECTION FROM NOW ON.  INTERESTING COMING FROM JAMIE RASKIN SOMEONE WHO DIDN'T JUST REJECT THE RESULTS OF THE 2016 ELECTION BUT ALSO WROTE ABOUT HIS BELIEF THAT GEORGE W. BUSH AND DICK CHEYNEY HAD STOLEN THEIR ELECTION. VERY COMMON TO HEAR THIS TYPE OF RHETORIC FROM DEMOCRATS. BUT IT SPEAKS TO SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR REPUBLICANS TO RECOGNIZE. DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOME OF THESE MESSAGES GO UNCHECKED AND I THINK A LOT OF AMERICANS ARE WONDERING WHERE IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO STAND UP THAT THERE ARE TWO STANDARDS OF JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN REPUBLICAN, IT SEEMS TO BE AN ATTEMPT TO CRIMINALIZE THIS THING AND JAMIE RASKIN SHOULD REMEMBER THAT IN THIS ELECTION, PEOPLE DID CHOOSE TO GIVE THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO REPUBLICANS. PROBABLY IN PART TO STOP SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING WITH THE JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE AND OTHER THINGS.  Laura: ALL RIGHT LADIES THANK YOU GREAT TO SEE BOTH OF YOU TONIGHT  NOW WILL SMITH BREAKS HIS SILENCE ON THE SLAP HEARD ROUND THE WALL. PLUS SOCCER OR REAL FOOTBALL. THE ONEN A ONLY JIMMY FAILLA IS HERE WITH ANSWERS PLUS HE'LL TELL US WHETHER HE WOULD SUE SOMEONE OVER HIS OWN COOKING. STAY WITH US. \u266a  Laura: LET'S DO A QUICK WHIP AROUND OF THE MOST RIDICULOUS STORIES WE'VE BEEN READING JUST OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS. JOINING ME NOW IS JIMMY FAILLA HOST OF FOX ACROSS AMERICA WITH JIMMY FAILLA WHICH AIRS WEEKDAYS ON FOX NEWS RADIO. JIMMY, GOOD TO SEE YOU. FIRST, COME ON.  HEY, HEY, HEY.  Laura: NICE SHIRT, BY THE WAY. WHERE'S YOUR COWBOY HAT? I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR SPURS ARE TONIGHT. A HUGE WIN FOR THE U.S. OVER IRAN TODAY SENDING THEM, YOU KNOW, TO THE WORLD CUP. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT A DEBATE HAPPENING BETWEEN AMERICA AND, WELL, THE REST OF THE WORLD. IS IT SOCCER OR FOOTBALL? WATCH.  THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.  KICK OFF BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES IN IRAN. YOU HEAR THE CHANT.  Laura: JIMMY, SETTLE THE DEBATE.  I MEAN, COME ON INGRAM, YOU KNOW IT'S ALL ABOUT AMERICAN FOOTBALL AND ANYONE WHO'S EVER WATCHED AMERICAN FOOTBALL, WHEN YOU WATCH SOCCER, YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING AN R RATED MOVIE ON BASIC CABLE BECAUSE ALL GOOD STUFF IS CUT OUT. THERE'S NO TACKLING. YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO SCORING. LIKE SOCCER, FOR REAL, IS TWO HOURS WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN. IT'S LIKE YOU'RE WATCHING JOHN FETTERMAN TRYING TO COMPLETE A SENTENCE, OKAY? VERY ANTICLIMACTIC, NOTHING EVER HAPPENS. I SAY NO. BUT I AM AMAZED, LAURA, HOW DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE IN THE WORLD IT HAS DIFFERENT MEANINGS. LIKE IF YOU'RE IN GERMANY FOOTBALL MEANS SOCCER BUT IF YOU'RE IN CLEVELAND OHIO FOOTBALL MEANS SADNESS BECAUSE THE BROWNS SUCK.  Laura: JIMMY THEY WERE TRIPPING EACH OTHER THE ENTIRE GAME. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT WAS A STRATEGY BUT THEY WERE TRIPPING EACH OTHER THE ENTIRE GAME AS FAR AS I COULD TELL. THAT WAS THE MOST FUN PART OF THE GAME BUT I'M SO PSYCHED AMERICA WON. JIMMY NEXT TOPIC, WILL SMITH, HE'S STILL TALKING ABOUT HIS SLAP HEARD ROUND THE WORLD AGAINST CHRIS ROCK'S FACE AT THE OSCAR'S BUT NOW HE THINKS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE KNOW WHAT HIS NINE YEAR OLD NEPHEW THOUGHT? WATCH.  THAT WAS A RAGE THAT HAD BEEN BOTTLED FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. WE'RE SITTING IN MY KITCHEN AND HE'S ON MY LAP AND HE'S HOLDING THE OSCAR AND HE'S JUST LIKE, WHY DID YOU HIT THAT MAN UNCLE WILL, YOU KNOW? DAM IT. WHY YOU TRYING TO OPRAH ME.  Laura: DOES THAT SOUND BELIEVABLE THAT STORY?  YEAH. SO IN ADDITION TO BEING A BAD AUDIENCE MEMBER, HE'S ALSO A TERRIBLE UNCLE. WHAT IS THIS NINE YEAR OLD KID DOING HANGING OUT WHEN THE OSCARS FINALLY ENDED, LIKE A SEVEN-HOUR CEREMONY LIKE COME ON WILL SMITH. AND HE GOT HIMSELF IN MORE TROUBLE WITH HOLLYWOOD BECAUSE ONE OF THE EXCUSES HE MADE WAS HE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE SUPER MAN AND SAVE THE DAY. BUT AS YOU KNOW IN HOLLYWOOD IT'S SUPER THEM. YOU CAN'T SAYMEN. YOU CAN'T SAY SUPERMAN'S GENDER. AND REALLY QUICK LAURA. THE OSCARS BLEW ET. THEY SHOULD HAVE EMBRACED THIS. PEOPLE HATE CELEBRITIES SO MUCH. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH BETTER RATINGS WOULD BE IF YOU COULD SMACK ONE PRESENT EACH YEAR AT THE OSCARS. I WOULD TUNE IN FOR IT.  Laura: IF YOU COULD VOTE FOR IT OR DO LIKE THE THREE STOOGES THING, HE DO DO A WHOLE THREE STOOGES THING WITH THE SLAPPING AND CLAPPING OF THE EARS.  LAURA IF YOU THINK THIS YEAR'S CEREMONY WAS LONG WAIT UNTIL NEXT YEAR WHEN THEY HAVE MAIL-IN VOTING. YOU'LL BE SITTING THERE FOR A WEEK TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO WON BEST PICTURE.  Laura: GENDERLESS. WE CAN'T HAVE ANY GENDER AT ANY OF THE AWARD CEREMONIES. NEXT TOPIC, A WOMAN IS NOW SUING VEL VITA BECAUSE THE MAC AND CHEESE TOOK TOO LONG TO MAKE. I GUESS THE LAWSUIT IS STATING THAT CONSUMERS SEEING READY IN 3.5 MINUTES WILL BELIEVE IT REPRESENTS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO PREPARE MEANING THE MOMENT IT IS OPEN UNTIL THE MOMENT IT'S READY TO STUFF IN YOUR BIG FACE. HER COMPLAINT IS THE PACKAGING ISN'T HONEST. I KNOW YOU'RE A FINE DINING CONNOISSEUR YOURSELF SO ARE YOU GOING TO JOIN THIS LAWSUIT MAKE IT A CLASS ACTION?  YES. IN MY AFFORDABLE STRIPPER LOOK, I DO, I LOOK LIKE A STREPPER WHO LET HIMSELF GO. MY NAME IS TRAGIC MIKE. STICK WITH ME INGRAM. THE REASON THIS LAWSUIT IS GOING NOWHERE IS BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU DON'T BUY VEL VITA INSTA CUP BECAUSE OF THE THREE MINUTES, YOU BUY THEM BECAUSE YOU HATE YOUR FAMILY. OKAY? THAT'S THE MESSAGE WHEN YOU'RE BUYING THEM THREE MINUTE VEL VITA. THIS IS CRAP. AND WHAT I LOVE ABOUT STORY IS THAT SHE FILED A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT TO BRING OTHER VEL VITA CONSUMERS INTO HER AFFAIR HERE. THIS ACTUALLY SOUNDS LIKE A ROM-COM CALLED LOVE HANDLES ACTUALLY. STUPID.  Laura: VELVEETA, I DON'T THINK I'VE HAD THAT SINCE LIKE 1977. HAVEN'T HAD IT FOR A WHILE BUT --  BECAUSE YOU LOVE YOURSELF. YOU HAVE TO LOVE YOURSELF LAURA. COME ON, MAN.  Laura: IT KIND OF TASTE GOOD THE FIRST TWO BITES. JIMMY GREAT TO SEE YOU, YOU'RE ROCKING THAT SHIRT. I HAVE TO BORROW THAT.  Laura: MIXED MESSAGES ON THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OVER COVID. SHOCKING, I KNOW. THE LAST BITE WILL EXPLAIN IT ALL. I WANT THAT SHIRT. 20221130035451.553|20221130035954.989",

        "trs": "PELOSI STILL SPEAKER. THIS WEEK THE HOUSE WILL TAKE UP A BILL ADOPTING THE TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WITH NO POISON PILLS OR CHANGES TO THE NEGOTIATED TERMS AND SEND TO THE SENATE, MY HOPE NECESSARY STRIKE AVERTING LEGISLATION WILL EARN A STRONGLY BIPARTISAN VOTE GIVING AMERICA'S FAMILIES CONFIDENCE IN PROTECTING THEIR FINANCIAL FUTURES. LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL, GUY BENSON POLITICAL EDITOR AT TOWN HALL.COM AND HOST OF THE GUY BENSON SHOW FOX NEWS RADIO. JESSICA TARLOV AND JOSHUA KRAUSHAAR HOUR SENIOR CORRESPONDENT FOR AXIOS. TO COME TO SOME RESOLUTION. SO YOU PUNT IT TO CONGRESS IN A LAME DUCK AND YOU TRY TO GET.  THIS LOOKS LIKE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT LEADING FROM BEHIND WHERE BIDEN WANTED THE POLITICAL CREDIT BEFORE THE MIDTERMS IN NEGOTIATING WITH THE UNION AND THE MANAGEMENT TO HAVE THIS TENTATIVE DEAL AND NOW THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT TENTATIVE DEAL WITH ACTUALLY WORK OUT BY THE DEADLINE IN DECEMBER, HE IS NOW PUNTING TO CONGRESS TO GET SOMETHING DONE. NOW, I THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE A VERY STRONG LIKELIHOOD AS SPEAKER PELOSI INDICATED THAT THERE IS A BIPARTISAN MOMENTUM FOR SOME DEAL TO PREVENT A STRIKE FROM TAKING PLACE, BUT, YOU CAN SEE IN THE WHITE HOUSE'S DISENGAGEMENT THAT THEY KNOW THAT BIDEN HIMSELF CAN'T REALLY, YOU KNOW, NEGOTIATE EFFECTIVELY AND THEY ARE TRYING TO PUNT THE BALL AND GIVE CONTROL TO CONGRESS.  Bret: JESSICA, THEY ARE MAKING THE ASSESSMENT THAT THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS, IF IT WERE TO HAPPEN AT THIS TIME IS TOO GREAT NOT TO DO WHAT THEY ARE DOING.  I AGREE WITH THEM AND I THINK ULTIMATELY CONGRESS WILL SIDE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT OF THIS. I THINK THAT COMING OUT OF THE COVID PERIOD WHERE WE HAVE SEEN WHAT UTTER DEVASTATION DOES TO THE COUNTRY NO ONE WILL WANT TO DO THAT. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHEN IT DOES GO TO CONGRESS. CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS A LOT OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE UPSET ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE PAID SICK LEAVE TERMS WHICH WERE THE MAJOR STICKING POINT FOR FOUR MAJOR UNIONS HOLDOUTS ARE STILL NOT GOING TO BE SATISFACTORY. TO JOSH'S POINT THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PUNTED INTO THE NEXT TERM WHEN SPEAKER PELOSI WILL NOT BE SPEAKER PELOSI AND THINGS WILL LOOK A LOT DIFFERENT IN CONGRESS. BUT IT DEFINITELY SEEMS LIKE PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS HOPING TO GET SOMETHING DONE THAT ULTIMATELY HE COULD NOT GET DONE. AND THE LABOR UNIONS ARE NOT GOING TO BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS.  Bret: YEAH. AND SO, GUY, IN BIDEN'S STATEMENT, THE PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT HE GOES ON TO SAY SOME IN CONGRESS WANT TO MODIFY THE DEAL EITHER APPROVE IT FOR LABOR OR MANAGEMENT HOWEVER WELL-INTENTIONED ANY CHANGES WOULD RISK DELAY AND DEBILITATING SHUT DOWN. AGREEMENT REACHED IN GOOD FAITH BY BOTH SIDES. SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH WITH AS IS. THERE WILL BE EFFORTS TO PUMP IT UP INSIDE CONGRESS.  YEAH. BECAUSE THINGS GET MESSY IN CONGRESS. I'M JUST STRUCK BY THE LACK OF LEADERSHIP HERE BY THE PRESIDENT. HE WALLS SUPPOSED TO MR. BLUE COLLAR, MR. LABOR UNION. THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG TALKING POINTS THAT HE USED SELLING POINTS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR THE COUNTRY IT. HAS LOTS OF IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR ECONOMY AND HE IS EFFECTIVELY RATHER THAN ROLLING UP HIS SLEEVES JUST WALKING AWAY AND SAYING LET CONGRESS DEAL WITH IT. MY GUESS IS, MY CYNICAL GUESS IS THIS PROBABLY GETS DONE BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES WANT TO AVOID AN ECONOMIC DISASTER BUT, THERE IS MORE OF A CHANCE OF A STRIKE HAPPENING NOW THAN THERE WAS BEFORE THE ELECTION BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THE UNION BOSSES ARE GOING TO LET THAT HAPPEN TO THEIR ALIGNED PARTY. THE DEMOCRATS BEFORE THE ELECTION. WE'RE NOW PAST THE ELECTION, SO, SOME OF THAT POLITICAL CALCULUS MAY HAVE CHANGED JUST A LITTLE BIT ON THEIR END.   Bret: MEANTIME, ON THE ENERGY FRONT, JOSH, JOHN KIRBY AT THE WHITE HOUSE ASKED ABOUT THE EFFORT TO NOW ALLOW CHEVRON IN VENEZUELA TO PUMP OIL, AS OPPOSED TO FOCUSING ON DOMESTIC ENERGY. TAKE A LISTEN.  THE PRESIDENT HAS ISSUED 9,000 PERMITS FOR DRILLING ON U.S. FEDERAL LANDS, PETER, 9,000 OF THEM BEING UNUSED THERE ARE PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR OIL AND GAS COMPANIES TO DRILL HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. I WILL LET CHEVRON SPEAK FOR THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE OF SANCTIONS RELIEF. BUT OUR INSPECTION IS IT WON'T BE A LOT OF OIL COMING OUT OF THERE. THERE HAVE TO BE SHIPPED TO THE UNITED STATES.  Bret: IT IS A LITTLE TOUGH FOR, YOU KNOW, JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AFTER THE PRESIDENT SAID THERE WILL BE NO MORE DRILLING AND AFTER ALL HE SAID PREVIOUSLY ABOUT FOSSIL FUELS TO BE SAYING THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE WHEN IT DOCUMENTS DOMESTIC PRODUCTION, JOSH.  YEAH. THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF MIXED MESSAGES COMING FROM THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE WHEN IT COMES TO ENERGY PRODUCTION. I MEAN, WE SAW THE SORT OF TACTICS THIS WHITE HOUSE HAS USED IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO LOWER GAS PRICES. YOU SAW THE TAPPING ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS OF THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE, WHICH IS USUALLY RESERVED FOR EMERGENCIES. YOU SAW THE TRIP TO SAUDI ARABIA WHERE THE PRESIDENT UNSUCCESSFULLY WAS TRYING TO LOBBY THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT TO PUMP MORE OIL AND NOW RETURN TO VENEZUELA AND ALLOWING CHEVRON TO RESUME SOME OF ITS LIMITED PRODUCTION. YOU DON'T HEAR A LOT, UNLIKE JOHN KIRBY'S COMMENTS YOU DON'T HEAR A LOT ABOUT DOMESTIC PRODUCTION AS PART OF A LONG-TERM STRATEGY. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET INSTANTANEOUS RESULTS FROM TRYING TO TAP MORE DOMESTIC OIL BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE, I THINK, POLITICALLY SMART FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION TO TALK ABOUT LONG-TERM STRATEGIES AND TO ENGAGE THE DOMESTIC OIL INDUSTRY IN GETTING MORE OIL PUMPED INTO THE SYSTEM.  Bret: JESSICA, REPUBLICANS DID TALK ABOUT THAT ON THE TRAIL. DIDN'T SEEM LIKE DEMOCRATS TOOK A HIT FOR THAT, EVEN IN SOME PLACES WHERE YOU THOUGHT THEY WOULD LIKE PENNSYLVANIA.  WELL, THIS ELECTION ENDED UP BEING ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS THAT MOST DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE NAMELY ABORTION. THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA WE REALLY SAW WHAT HAVING A POOR QUALITY CANDIDATE MEANT AND MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT IF THE REPUBLICANS HAD RUN SOMEONE BETTER THAN DR. OZ OR DOUG MASTRIANO IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE THERE. WE HAVE TO CHALK IT UP TO THAT ON THAT FRONT. IN TERMS OF JOHN KIRBY'S MESSAGING WHAT GOING ON IN VENEZUELA. THIS IS THE RESULTS OF THE BEGINNING OF NEGOTIATIONS MEXICO CITY VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT AND OPPOSITION LEADERS. AND WHAT THEY WANT IS A U.N. FUND THAT WILL HELP THEM ADMINISTER FUNDS TO GO REGULAR VENEZUELANS TO HELP WITH INFRASTRUCTURE. TO HELP WITH HEALTHCARENNED AND THE IDEA FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION THAT WE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING DEMOCRATIC EFFORTS IN VENEZUELA AND EASE SANCTIONS AS A CARROT TO HOPEFULLY MOVE IN A BETTER DIRECTION. DID I NOT FEEL THAT WAS PROPERLY DISCUSSED FROM THE PODIUM THAT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE KNOW IS GOING ON. IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE HEY, WE ARE OKAY WITH VENEZUELA BE OIL HERE EVEN THOUGH IT'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT AND ACTUALLY SANCTIONS IMPLEMENTED IN 2019. MUCH BROADER STORY THAN I FEEL PEOPLE ARE GETTING AND I WISH THE ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN CLEARER ABOUT THAT.  Bret: GUY, LAST WORD ON THIS?  WELL, I THINK IT'S NAIVE POLICY ON FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. I WOULD COMMEND MARY O'GRADY'S PIECE IN THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" TODAY REALLY LAYING IT OUT AND JOSH MADE THE POINT THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE ADMINISTRATION WANTS TO PRETEND LIKE THEY ARE PRO-PRODUCTION HERE AT HOME. THERE IS ALL THESE 9,000 PERMITS GO AND DRILL. THEY ARE TELLING, YOU KNOW, A WHOLE GROUP, ENTIRELY INDUSTRY THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO PUT OUT OF BUSINESS WHICH THEY SAY OPENLY AND THEN THE NEXT DAY TO A DIFFERENT AUDIENCE THEY SAFE NO MORE DRILLING, WE ARE SHUTTING THIS THING DOWN. THESE ARE NOT RECONCILABLE POSITIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY SEPARATE AND THE SPIN, I THINK, FOR THAT REASON IS UNCONVINCING AND PRETTY FEEBLE.  Bret: AND ON THE WORLD STAGE, ANOTHER BIG MOMENT. THIS IS FROM 1998.  THE U.S. IRAN GAME. TOMORROW, JOSH, IT'S BIG STUFF NOT ONLY THE GAME ITSELF BUT EVERYTHING SURROUNDING IT.  YEAH. BRET. I MEAN, YOU CAN'T OVERSTATE THE AMOUNT OF BRAVERY THAT THE IRANIAN SOCCER PLAYERS SHOWED WHEN THEY REFUSED TO SING THE IRANIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM. IT WAS A REALLY MOVING MOMENT AND ONE THAT COULD POSE A GREAT RISK TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES, APPARENTLY THE IRANIAN REGIME, THE AYATOLLAH HAS THREATENED THE LIVES OF THEIR FAMILIES IF THEY MISBEHAVE AT THE MATCH TOMORROW. SO IT'S A LOT OF GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS FOR WHAT IS -- SHOULD BE A PRETTY FUN SOCCER GAME WORLD CUP.  Bret: IT WILL BE GOOD TO WATCH. I WON'T DO CANDIDATE CASINO FOR THE SCORE BUT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD GAME TO WATCH. THTHANK YOU, ALL.  ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU, BRET. \u266a \u266a END|20221128235955|2022-11-28_2300_US_FOX-News_Special_Report_With_Bret_Baier ",

        "trs": " Bill: HERE WE GO AGAIN. EARLY VOTING IS UNDERWAY IN GEORGIA. THE RUNOFF RACE FOR SENATE IS A WEEK AWAY. HERSCHEL WALKER AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK HITTING THE TRAIL TODAY TRYING TO DRUM UP TURN OUT. WE'RE LIVE IN ATLANTA. ALL THEY DO IN GEORGIA IS VOTE. GOOD MORNING.  GOOD MORNING, BILL. SEEMS LIKE IT. BOTH CANDIDATES WARNOCK AND WALKER ARE OUT FIGHTING THIS RACE OUT AS EARLY VOTING OPENS UP STATEWIDE. YOU KNOW HERE ON THE GROUND BILL AND DANA YOU GET A SENSE FROM VOTERS THAT THIS RACE, RUNOFF IS STILL OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO FOLKS IN GEORGIA. THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE. ACCORDING TO THE GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE, MORE THAN 157,000 FOLKS CAST BALLOTS ON THE FIRST SUNDAY AND SATURDAY OF EARLY VOTING. MORE THAN 1 1/2 TIMES THE TURNOUT COMPARED TO THE FIRST WEEKEND OF EARLY VOTING DURING THE GENERAL ELECTION. THIS IS AT LEAST THEORETICALLY A WIN FOR DEMOCRATS WHO FOUGHT AND WON IN COURT TO HAVE SATURDAY VOTING FOLLOWING THANKSGIVING AFTER THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE SAID IT WAS AGAINST STATE LAW TO HAVE VOTING AFTER A STATE HOLIDAY. THAT DECISION BY THE COURTS MADE WAY FOR MORE THAN TWO DOZEN COUNTIES TO OPEN UP POLLING SITES THIS WEEKEND. AT SOME LOCATIONS LENGTHY LINES FORMED CREATING WAITS AS LONG AS 2 TO 3 HOURS. FOLKS STUCK IT OUT TO VOTE THEIR CONVICTIONS.  THE ABORTION ISSUE. I BELIEVE WOMEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND MR. WARNOCK REPRESENTS THAT RIGHT.  I REALLY FEEL LIKE I LIKE A SMALLER GOVERNMENT, NOT SO MANY REGULATIONS AND POWER AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL.  MEANTIME BOTH WARNOCK AND WALKER ARE OUT TRYING TO DELIVER CLOSING MESSAGES. THEY HOPE WILL ENERGIZE MORE FOLKS TO GET OUT AND VOTE. WARNOCK IS TRYING TO ATTRACT THE DEMOCRATIC BASE BUT ALSO LOOKING TO ATTRACT REPUBLICANS WHO REFUSE TO VOTE FOR WALKER. WARNOCK CAMPAIGN WANTS THE RACE TO BE ABOUT CHARACTER AND THE WALKER CAMPAIGN IS CHALLENGING THEM ON THAT IN THIS NEW ATTACK AD OUT TODAY. TAKE A LISTEN.  CHARACTER IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN NOBODY IS WATCHING.  WARNOCK THOUGHT NO ONE WAS WATCHING WHEN HIS EXWIFE CALLED POLICE TO REPORT HIS ABUSE.   [INAUDIBLE]  THINGS SEEM TO BE MOVING PRETTY GOOD WITH EARLY VOTING RIGHT NOW. THE GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE SAYS AT LEAST THREE COUNTIES ARE ALMOST AT 20% OF THEIR VOTE TOTAL THAT THEY COLLECTED DURING THE GENERAL ELECTION BACK IN EARLIER THIS MONTH. THINGS SEEM TO BE MOVING PRETTY GOOD, GUYS.  Bill: EIGHT DAYS AND COUNTING. THANKS, CHARLES, NICE TO SEE YOU IN ATLANTA.  Dana: IRAN CALLED FOR THE U.S. TO BE KICKED OUT OF THE WORLD CUP IN QATAR AFTER THE U.S. SOCCER FEDERATION SHOWED THE FLAG WITHOUT THE ISLAMIC. THIS IS A JOURNALIST OUTSPOKEN ABOUT THE REGIME. THE QUOTE IS WE WANTED TO SHOW OUR SUPPORT FOR THE WOMEN IN IRAN WITH OUR GRAPHIC FOR 24 HOURS. IT GOT NOTICED. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT?  I WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN I SAW THE FLAG WAS THE FLAG OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC. LET ME BE CLEAR WITH YOU. NOW THAT I'M TALKING TO YOU 10,000 PEOPLE ARE WATCHING ME ON MY INSTAGRAM LIVE. I AM BEING INSIDE WITH IRANIANS. THEY DON'T SEE THAT THE FOOTBALL TEAM REPRESENTS THEM. OUR FOOTBALL TEAM. ISLAMIC REPUBLICAN FOOTBALL TEAM. WHY I'M SAYING THAT BEFORE THE MEMBERS OF THE FOOTBALL TEAM COMING TO QATAR, THEY WERE ACTUALLY MEETING WITH A BUTCHER IN IRAN. MOST IMPORTANT THAN THIS HALF OF THE POPULATION IN IRAN ARE NOT ALLOWED TO GO TO THE STADIUM AND WATCH FOOTBALL GAME. THIS IS A GENDER APART HIDE REGIME AND THE TEAM REPRESENTS THE DICTATORSHIP. THEY WERE CELEBRATING THE VICTORY OF ENGLAND. PEOPLE ARE NOW HOPING THAT AMERICA BEATS THE FOOTBALL TEAM.  Bill: WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW AT 2:00. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR WEEKS. SOME SUGGEST 15,000 HAVE BEEN ARRESTED. UNCONFIRMED. IT IS HARD TO GET A FINAL NUMBER. THE NIECE OF IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER WENT TO YOUTUBE AND SAID THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN NOW, RIGHT? SHE SAID THE FOLLOWING.  FREE PEOPLE BE WITH US AND TELL YOUR GOVERNMENTS TO STOP SUPPORTING THIS MURDEROUS REGIME. IT DOES NOT KNOW ANY LAWS OR RULES EXCEPT FOR MAINTAINING ITS POWER IN ANY POSSIBLE WAY.  Bill: HOW SIGNIFICANT IS IT THAT SHE WOULD GO ONLINE WITH A STATEMENT LIKE THAT?  IT IS VERY SIGNIFICANT THAT YOU SEE THAT THE RELATIVE OF THE SUPREME LEADER DOESN'T BELIEVE IN HIM AND CALLING NOT ONLY YOUNG PEOPLE TO TAKE TO THE STREETS AND PROTEST. SHE WAS CALLING THE WESTERN COUNTRIES, THE DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES, THE LEADERS OF G7 TO TAKE ACTION. TAKE ACTION AND DO NOT ALLOW KHOMEINI TO KILL MORE PEOPLE. WE'VE SEEN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN PRISON AND MORE THAN 200 MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT, THEY ASKED FOR THE EXECUTION OF THOSE WHO ARE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW I'M TALKING TO YOU RAPPER IS IN PRISON. FOOTBALL PLAYER IS IN PRISON. THERE ARE MANY UNKNOWN ACTIVISTS THAT ARE IN PRISON. EVEN THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THOSE KILLED ARE IN PRISON. IN BLOODY NOVEMBER 15, '00 PEOPLE GOT KILLED. WRIT NOW I'M TALKING TO YOU THE MOTHER OF ONE OF THEM, WHICH WAS A SYMBOL OF IRAN PROTEST, IS IN PRISON. WHY? BECAUSE SHE SAID WHY DID YOU KILL MY SON? KILLING, TORTURING, TAKING HOSTAGE IS IN THE DNA OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC AND WHY I GET FURIOUS WHEN WE SEE PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD SAYING THE MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL TEAM DIDN'T SING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. PEOPLE ARE GETTING KILLED, ARE YOU KIDDING ME? PEOPLE ARE GETTING RAPED IN IRANIAN PRISON. IT IS NOT ENOUGH. WE WANT FIFA AND THE G7 KICK OUT AND ISOLATE THE ISLAMIC PUBLIC FROM EVERY WHERE.  FINALLY THE UNITED NATIONS, 25 COUNTRIES VOTED TO HAVE AN INVESTIGATION ABOUT THE BRUTAL RESPONSE OF THE ISLAMIC PUBLIC. FINALLY THEY DID. TOO LATE BUT IT IS A GOOD STEP. ANOTHER THING PRESIDENT MACRON RECOGNIZED THE UPRISING AS IT IS, THE REVOLUTION. HE SAID THAT I'M HAPPY TO MEET WITH THE LEADERS OF OPPOSITIONS, WHICH WAS A TABOO FOR YEARS AND YEARS. LEADERS OF DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES DON'T WANT THE TALK ABOUT REGIME CHANGE. WE ARE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT IT. PEOPLE IN THE STREETS ALREADY WANT TO END THE GENDER APARTHEID REGIME. ALL THEY WANT THE G7 COUNTRIES RECOGNIZE THE REVOLUTION, KICK OUT THE IRANIAN OFFICIALS AND DIPLOMATS FROM THE WESTERN COUNTRIES. RECALL THEIR AMBASSADORS. PUT THE GUARDS ON THE ACTIVITY LIST, REVOLUTIONARY GUARDS ARE NOT ONLY GOING AFTER IRANIANS THEY GO AFTER PEOPLE IN SYRIA, YEMEN, IN IRAQ AND SENDING DRONES TO PUTIN TO KILL INNOCENT UKRAINIANS.  Dana: THEY HAVE A GOOD VOICE IN YOU. THANK YOU FOR COMING ON THE SHOW AND KEEPING US INFORMED AND KEEPING THOSE PEOPLE THERE.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME.  Bill: ELON MUSK MIGHT RELEASE INFORMATION ON TWITTER CENSORSHIP OF THE HUNTER BIDEN STORY. WE'RE FOLLOWING THE MONEY ON FTX, TRYING TO. IT IS NOT EASY.

JUSTICES PUT A LOWER COURT RULING OVERTURNING THE BAN ON HOLD WHILE THEY CONSIDER AN APPEAL. ABORTION PROVIDERS WHO HAD RESUMED PERFORMING THE PROCEDURE PASSED SIX WEEKS AFTER THE LOWER COURT RULING WILL AGAIN HAVE TO STOP. THEY HAVE ALSO RULED THAT THE GEORGIA SUPREME COURT THAT COUNTIES WILL BE ALLOWED TO HOLD EARLY VOTING SATURDAY. FOR THE SENATE RUNOFF IN THAT STATE. REPUBLICANS HAD OBJECTED TO THE IDEA, WHICH IS BEING PUSHED BY DEMOCRATS. A SECTION OF GEORGIA LAW SAYS THE EARLY IN PERSON BALLOTING IS NOT ALLOWED SATURDAY BECAUSE FRIDAY IS A STATE HOLIDAY. DEMOCRATS INSIST THAT APPLIES ONLY TO PRIMARIES AND GENERAL ELECTIONS, NOT RUN-OFFS. UP NEXT, THE PANEL ON STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENTS, THE POSSIBLE RETURN OF MASK MANDATES AND WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN SHOULD BE THANKFUL FOR THIS HOLIDAY.

PAUSE ON THE HANDOUT AS IT FACES SERIOUS LEGAL CHALLENGES AND BIDEN BLAMING REPUBLICANS.  President Biden: PROVIDE STUDENT LOAN DEBT RELIEF, OFFICIALS SUED TO DENY THIS RELIEF, EVEN FOR THEIR OWN CONSTITUENTS, I'M CONFIDENT MY PLAN IS LEGAL, IT IS NOT FAIR TO ASK BORROWERS ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF TO RESUME STUDENT DEBT PANDEMIC WHILE THE COURTS CONSIDER THE LAWSUIT.  JUDGE, BEFORE I GO INTO THE BRIBE, HOW DOES THIS PLAY OUT IN COURT?  Jeanine: IT WILL PLAY OUT IN COURT AND HE'LL LOSE, AMAZING THING, FORGET THE BRIBE, HE LIED TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, DO YOU RECALL WHEN HE SAID I GOT THIS PASSED BY CONGRESS AND PASSED BY ONE OR TWO VOTES. HE LIED ABOUT IT, GAVE HIM A BUMP FOR THE MIDTERM AND START TRASHING THE REPUBLICANS SAYING THE REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING US -- PUTTING A HALT ON THIS I THINK THIS, THE TRUTH IS, IT IS COSTING $195 BILLION SO FAR, AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND THE AVERAGE MEDICAL STUDENT THAT WE THOUGHT GET 10,000, 20,000 AT THE MOST, THEY GET LIKE $107,000 CREDIT BASED ON ALL THE PAUSES AND BASED ON AN EMERGENCY THAT DOES NOT EXIST. THAT'S IT. [LAUGHTER]  ALL I HAVE TO SAY.  JESSICA, YOUR FRIEND AND MENTOR NANCY PELOSI, SAID HE COULDN'T DO THAT. WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT CHANGED?  Jessica: TIMES CHANGE, LAWRENCE, PEEP EVOLVE. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THIS WASN'T LEGAL, A LOT SAID IT WASN'T LEGAL, ELIZABETH WARREN HAVE BEEN BEHIND THIS. BIDEN CHANGED THE DIRECTION OF THIS AND FOLLOWS CLYBURN AND IT BECAME A MAJOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION HE THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT, WE'LL SEE HOW IT PLAYS OUT. I'M INTERESTED TO SEE HOW REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE GEN-Z IN THEIR DISTRICT AND MILLENNIALS WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS DEAL WITH IT. YOU SEE PEOPLE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN IN POWER, AND YOU SEE THEM TOUTING INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY COMING IN OR AMERICAN RESCUE ACT MONEY AND THESE ARE THINGS THEY VOTED AGAINST. HOW DO YOU LOOK STUDENTS IN THE EYE OR FORMER STUDENTS AND SAY, YOU GOT TO TELL THEM YOU ARE HAPPY ABOUT THIS, IT WILL GET YOU RELIEF THAT YOU NEED, BUT YOU VOTED AGAINST IT AND PEOPLE HOLD FOLKS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THINGS LIKE THAT AND THREE ISSUES MATTERED TO YOUNG VOTERS, IT WAS CLIMATE, STUDENT DEBT RELIEF AND ABORTION AND REPUBLICANS HAVE A HARD TIME EXPLAINING LACK OF SUPPORT FOR ALL THREE.  Greg: YOU CAN EXPLAIN THIS TO A YOUNG PERSON, THEY ARE NOT AS STUPID AS YOU THINK THEY ARE, THEY UNDERSTAND OTHER PEOPLE ARE PAYING FOR THIS. WHEN THEY DID THIS THEY FOUND PEOPLE WERE GOING TO SPEND THEIR MONEY ON GADGETRY, BOOZE AND DINING OUT, SO BASICALLY YOU ARE TAKING MONEY FROM HARD-WORKING AMERICANS TO PAY FOR IDLE LUXURY OF OVER EDUCATED LAY-ABOUTS AND ACTING LIKE THAT IS RELEE, PLAYING GAMES WITH RELIEF. WE'RE THE CHUMPS, SO EASY TO BE GENEROUS, IF YOU RUN INTO A YOUNG PERSON. WHY WOULD I BE AGAINST IT? WHY WOULD I BE AGAINST THAT? THAT MONEY SHOULD BE YOURS AND YOU SHOULD GET RELIEF? WHY BE AGAINST IT? IT IS TAKING FROM SOMEBODY ELSE, THAT IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S MONEY. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO TEACH PEOPLE WHERE, HOW REDISTRIBUTION WORKS AND HOW THIS IS SHEFT AND WHY IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. I WOULD PREFER IF SOMEBODY WERE TO DO THIS, GO AFTER BANKS AND HIGH INTEREST RATES AND COLLEGES, WHO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TOIC TATHE MOST ABSURD MAJORS AND TAKE THE LOANS AND I WONDER IF YOU ARE GOING TO SCHOOL RIGHT NOW, YOU GOT TO BE THINKING, I'M NOT PAYING OFF THOSE LOANS, THIS WILL HAPPEN AGAIN, IT IS ONLY TO BUILD IT BACK UP.  Jeanine: BORROWERS WITH DEBT UNAFFECTED BY FORGIVENESS ARE EXEMPTED, TOO.  Dagen: FOR 33 MONTHS BEEN MORATORIUM ON MAKING STUDENT LOAN PANDEMICS AND NO INTEREST ACCRUING ON THE LOAN, IN NUMBER ONE, IT IS ANOTHER HAND OUT, THAT IS A BAIL OUT, WHEN YOU DEFER A LOAN WITH NO INTEREST ACCRUING ON THE LOAN, IT IS DECLINING IN REAL VALUE BECAUSE OF THE INFLATION.  GREG TALKS ABOUT DECLINING VALUE OF MONEY, IT UPON HADS BORROWERS, THE BURDEN IS NOT JUST $150 BILLION PLUS BECAUSE INTEREST IS NOT ACCRUING ON LOANS, THIS IS WILDLY IDIOTICALLY INFLATIONARY AT TIME THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS HIKING INTEREST RATES TO THE MOON TO FIGHT THE INFLATION. WHAT IS HAPPENING? PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE, THERE IS A FINANCIAL BURDEN SOMEWHERE, IF YOU GO TO BUY A CAR WITH A LEASE, YOUR RATE IS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF BECAUSE THE FED FIGHTING INFLATION BECAUSE JOE BIDEN IS HANDING OUT MONEY. IF YOUR HOME IS GOING TO COLLAPSE IN VALUE NEXT YEAR BECAUSE OF THE INFLATION AND BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE IS FIGHTING IT, ALL THESE FINANCIAL BURDENS THAT PEOPLE WILL FEEL AND BEAR BECAUSE OF WHAT BIDEN IS DOING --  THEY DON'T CARE IT HELPED THEM LAST ELECTION.

FIRST, THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY RESPONDING FROM THE TOP HOUSE REPUBLICAN. KEVIN McCARTHY WITH THIS WARNING ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN THE GOP TAKES CONTROL IN JANUARY. WATCH.  I'M CALLING ON THE SECRETARY TO RESIGN. IF SECRETARY MAYORKAS DOESN'T RESIGN, HOUSE REPUBLICANS WILL INVESTIGATE EVERY ORDER, EVERY ACTION AND EVERY FAILURE AND DETERMINE WHETHER WE CAN BEGIN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY.  DHS TELLS FOX THAT MAYORKAS HAS NO PLAN TO RESIGN AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CAN DO BETTER THAN POINT THE FINGER AT SOMEONE ELSE. THEY SHOULD WORK ON SOLUTIONS FOR OUR BROKEN SYSTEM AND OUTDATED LAWS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN OVERHAULED IN 40 YEARS. MERCEDES SCHLAPP AND JUAN WILLIAMS IN JUST A MOMENT. BUT FIRST TO BILL MELUGIN LIVE AT THE BORDER IN EL PASO. GOOD AFTERNOON.  TRACE, GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU. AS THE BORDER CRISIS CONTINUES, WE CONTINUE TO SEE BOTH BIZARRE AND DANGEROUS METHODS OF HUMAN SMUGGLING. NEW INCIDENTS WE'D LIKE TO SHOW YOUR VIEWERS. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS PHOTO OF THE TUCSON SECTOR. AGENTS STOPPED A U-HAUL WORK TRUCK. THEY OPENED IT UP AND 5 ILLEGALS IN CAMOUFLAGE BEING SMUGGLED INSIDE IT. THE TRUCK WAS PADLOCKED SHUT. THEY HAD NO WAY OF GETTING OUT. A 37-YEAR-OLD U.S. CITIZEN WAS CHARGED WITH SMUGGLING. TAKE A LOOK AT THEY PHOTOS. THE BORDER PATROL STOPPING A UTILITY VEHICLE. SEVEN IMMIGRANTS WERE SMUGGLED IN THE BACK OF THAT WORK TRUCK. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS VIDEO IN TEXAS. THIS IS LA SALLE COUNTY TEXAS. A HUMAN SMUGGLER STOPS THE VEHICLE. FIVE PEOPLE GO BAILING OUT. THAT WAS A U.S. CITIZEN CHARGED. SHE WAS PAID $3,000 PER PERSON FOR THAT SMUGGLING. BORDER PATROL IN DEL RIO SECTOR REPORTING ON MONDAY IN A TWO-HOUR SPAN, THEY ARRESTED TWO SEX OFFENDERS. THEY ARRESTED SIX IN THAT SECTOR IN THE LAST WEEK ALONE. BACK OUT HERE LIVE IN DEL RIO, BUSY THE LAST WEEK ALONE. THEY'VE HAD MORE THAN 10,300 ILLEGAL CROSSINGS IN 6,000 KNOWN GOT-AWAYS. BIG NUMBERS FOR ONE SECTOR IN ONE SINGLE WEEK. NOW BACK TO YOU.  WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AS THE SHOW GOES ON. BILL MELUGIN LIVE AT THE BORDER. MERCEDES SCHLAPP IS HERE, A CPAC FOUNDATION SENIOR FELLOW AND JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST. JUAN, I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN LOOK AT THE PICTURES THAT BILL MELUGIN IS SHOWING US WITH DOZENS AND DOZENS OF PEOPLE STUFFED IN TO THE BACK OF TRUCKS AND LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE AND NOT BELIEVE THERE'S A LEGITIMATE AND SEVERE PROBLEM AT THE BORDER. YET THE DHS IS LITERALLY TELLING REPUBLICANS TO STOP POINTING FINGERS AND TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. YOU KNOW WHO ELSE IS POINTING FINGERS, JUAN? DEMOCRATS. LISTEN TO GOVERNOR-ELECT KATIE HOBBS FROM ARIZONA.  I DON'T THINK THEY'RE DOING ENOUGH. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THEM VISIT AND SEE FIRST HAND THE KIND OF SUPPORT AND RELIEF THAT FOLKS IN THESE COMMUNITIES NEED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.  JUAN, YOUR THOUGHTS.  WELL, I THINK THAT SENATOR MARK KELLY SAID YESTERDAY, DEMOCRATS NEED TO DO MORE. KATIE HOBBS IS REPEATING THAT THEME. HE ALSO SAID REPUBLICANS NEED TO STOP BEATING UP ON THIS ISSUE AND SOLVE IT. DO SOMETHING. THAT'S WHAT YOU HEARD IN THE STATEMENT THAT YOU READ, TRACE, FROM SECRETARY MAYORKAS' OFFICE AND DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. IT'S NOT THAT ANYONE IS SAYING THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM.  EVERYBODY IS SAYING THAT. PEOPLE ARE SAYING THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM. YOU HAVE THE DHS SECRETARY GOING BEFORE CONGRESS TIME AND TIME AGAIN SAYING THE BORDER IS SECURE. IF THAT'S NOT SAYING THERE'S NOT A PROBLEM, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.  THAT'S NOT SAYING --  LET ME SAY ONE THING --  WAIT, WAIT. YOU'RE MISINTERPRETING THIS, TRACE. THE SECRETARY IS SAYING WE HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF APPREHENSIONS RIGHT NOW. OBVIOUSLY THE BORDER POLICE, THE CUSTOMS FORCE, THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB. THEY'RE ARRESTS PEOPLE IN RECORD NUMBERS, TRACE. THE ARGUMENT HERE IS ABOUT WHAT TO DO.  JUAN, THE NUMBERS -- I HAVE BEEN COVERING THE BORDER FOR 35 YEARS. IT WAS MY FIRST JOB IN TELEVISION. I KNOW EXACTLY THE PROBLEM. IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME. MERCEDES, I'LL LET YOU JUMP IN.  THERE YOU GO.  TO SAY PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING IN THIS COUNTRY IN RECORD NUMBERS AND THEY ARE AND WALKING A CROSS THE BORDER, BEING STUFFED INTO TRUCKS IS DISINGENUOUS.  THAT'S NOT US, TRACE. THAT'S NOT WHAT ANYONE IS SAYING. NO ONE IS SAYING THAT. I WISH YOU'D STOP. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THERE'S A NEW STREAM OF PEOPLE COMING FROM NICARAGUA, CUBA, VENEZUELA. THERE'S ALL NEW ISSUES.  DOESN'T MATTER. IT'S THE BORDER ITSELF THAT IS INSECURED. GO AHEAD, MERCEDES.  I THINK I'M GOING TO BECOME THE MODERATOR. YOU'RE TO AGO GREAT JOB. IT'S NOT JUST A PROBLEM. IT'S A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN LIVES. THE MERE FACT IS THAT WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE NOTHING TO STOP THIS BORDER CRISIS. INSTEAD, IT'S CREATED A MAGNET. INSTEAD, THE POLICIES PUT IN PLACE, THE POLICIES THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN AWAY LIKE REMAIN IN MEXICO WHERE THEY IN ESSENCE ARE CALLING FOLKS TO COME IN TO THE COUNTRY, THAT HAS CREATED RECORD NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS COMING IN TO THE COUNTRY WHERE THERE'S CATCH AND RELEASE AND PEOPLE ARE BEING ABLE TO GO IN TO THE INTERIOR OF THIS NATION WITHOUT ANY SORT OF CONTROL. THIS BORDER SECURITY ISSUE SHOULD BE A BIPARTISAN ISSUE AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE FAILED TO PROTECT OUR BORDERS --  I WANT TO PUT THESE NUMBERS UP, MERCEDES. LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. THIS IS THE ENCOUNTERS. LOOK AT THAT. TWO MILLION PLUS ENCOUNTERS. THE GOT-AWAYS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THAT. LOOK AT THE FENTANYL DRUG SEIZURES. ROLL OVER. YOU HAVE 14.7 THOUSAND POUNDS OF FENTANYL. THAT'S 30, 40% HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR. IT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM. I'LL GIVE YOU 10 SECONDS TO WRAP IT UP, JUAN. I HATE TO BE JUMPING YOUR THING THERE. BUT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN, WE NEED TO SECURE THE BORDER, KEEP BUILDING THE BORDER WALL. WE NEED TO REINFORCE THE NUMBER OF BORDER PATROL AGENTS DOWN THERE. THERE'S BEEN SOLUTIONS COMING AND JOE BIDEN HAS NEVER BEEN TO THE BORDER AND KAMALA HARRIS HAS DONE ZERO AT THE BORDER. YOUR FINAL THOUGHTS?  WHAT IS McCARTHY DOING DOWN THERE? HE'S RUNNING TO BE SPEAKER AND HE DOESN'T HAVE THE VOTES SO HE'S PUTTING ON PERFORMANCE POLITICAL ART. HE'S NOT SOLVING ANYTHING SAYING YES, I HAVE AN IDEA. THERE'S PROPOSALS UNDER BUSH, UNDER TRUMP, UNDER OBAMA. WHO BLOCKED IT? IT WAS REPUBLICANS --  AND THE DEMOCRATS -- THE DEMOCRATS -- I WAS THERE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. JUAN, I'M SORRY.  Martha: THEY'RE GIVING ME THE WRAP. 5 SECONDS, MERCEDES.  I WAS THERE DURING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. WE TRADE TO WORK ON VARIOUS DEALS WITH THE DEMOCRATS. THEY REFUSED TO COME TO THE TABLE. THEY DON'T WANT TO SOLVE THIS BORDER CRISIS. IN FACT, THEY'RE MAKING IT WORSE.  THANK YOU BOTH. ONE WEEK AFTER A COURT OVERTURNED GEORGIA'S ABORTION BAN, THE STATE SUPREME COURT HAS PUT IT BACK ON THE BOOKS. THEY CONSIDER AN APPEAL. THIS IS NOT THE END OF THE LEGAL BATTER. BUT FOR NOW, THE BAN ON ABORTIONS IN GEORGIA AFTER A HEARTBEAT IS DETECTED IS BACK IN EFFECT. MEANTIME, PRESIDENT ZELENSKY BLASTING RUSSIA TODAY AS DOZENS OF ROCKETS POUND UKRAINE HITTING CIVILIAN TARGETS INCLUDING MATERNITY WARD OF A HOSPITAL KILLING A NEWBORN BABY.

NEW POLLS SHOW WARNOCK HAS A SLIM LEAD OVER REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER HERSCHEL WALKER. JONATHAN SERRIE JOINS US FROM ATLANTA THIS MORNING. HI.  OLDER VOTERS MAY DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THIS GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFF. BIPARTISAN TEAM OF POLLSTERS COMMISSIONED BY AARP FOUND THAT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK HAS A NARROW LEAD. 51% OVER HERSCHEL WALKER AT 47%. WARNOCK LEADS BY A 24-POINT MARGIN AMONG YOUNGER VOTERS. WALKER LEADS BY NINE POINTS AMONG VOTERS 50 AND OLDER. THIS GROUP MAKES UP 62% OF LIKELY VOTERS IN GEORGIA.

ARE YOU REALLY WILLING TO DO ANYTHING, INCLUDING LYING TO THE VOTERS IN GEORGIA, TO BECOME A SENATOR?  WE REACHED OUT TO THE WALKER CAMPAIGN FOR COMMENT AND THEY HAVE YET TO RESPOND.

WARNOCK IS TARGETING MODERATES SPEAKING ABOUT BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION HE SPONSORED IN THE SENATE AND RUNNING POLITICAL ADS FEATURING PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR KEMP BUT DID NOT SUPPORT WALKER IN THE SENATE RACE.

SINCE THE RED WAVE NEVER MATERIALIZED DOES POLLING REALLY MATTER, MR. POLLSTER?  WELL, I THINK POLLING ACTUALLY HAS BEEN PRETTY ACCURATE IN THE GEORGIA SENATE RACE. IT WAS LAST TIME. ALL THE POLLS SHOWED A VERY CLOSE RACE AND THERE WAS ONE. SO I WOULD BELIEVE THE POLLS IN GEORGIA. I THINK THAT WAS A REASONABLE POLL DONE BY THE AARP. I THINK IT SHOWS WARNOCK HAS AN EDGE. HE HASN'T NECESSARILY PUT IT AWAY. TURNOUT WILL BE IMPORTANT. WILL THE DEMOCRATS GET YOUNG PEOPLE VOTING IN A RUNOFF ELECTION? SO FAR THEY'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN TURNOUT. IN FACT, I THINK THE OVERPERFORMANCE BY DEMOCRATS WAS LARGELY THAT THEY WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL AT THE TURNOUT GAME THAN THEY WERE SO MUCH THAT THE POLLS WERE WRONG.  AARP DIRECTOR SAYS GEORGIA WANTS THEIR LEADERS TO PROVIDE SOLUTION TO INFLATION AND THE RISING COST OF LIVING. PRESERVE DEMOCRACY AND PROTECT THEIR HEALTH AND FINANCIAL SECURITY. THE MESSAGE IS CLEAR. IF THESE CANDIDATE WANT TO WIN THE U.S. SENATE SEAT THEY SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO THE MATTER ISSUES THAT MATTER TO GEORGIA 50 PLUS. OLDER VOTERS TYPICALLY SHOW UP, RIGHT?  WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT'S TRUE. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE REPORTER, A LOT OF THE CHARGES BACK AND FORTH ARE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, PERSONAL ACTIONS. I THINK WALKER HAS BEEN ON THE DEFENSIVE WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS PERSONAL ACTIONS. NOT SO MUCH ABOUT THE ISSUES FOR HIM. WARNOCK IS RUNNING A SMART CAMPAIGN TO GO AFTER THE MIDDLE OR MODERATE VOTERS. AND I THINK THAT WALKER'S CHALLENGE IS TO GET BACK TO THE ISSUES AND OVERCOME THE PERSONAL ATTACKS HE HAS. IF HE CAN DO THAT HE MIGHT DO A LITTLE BETTER.  Mike: LET'S TALK SWING AND INDEPENDENCE VOTERS. SWING VOTERS STILL EXIST AND PAY ATTENTION TO PARTY SELECTION OF CANDIDATES AND ISSUES. MOBILIZATION OF THE PARTY FAITHFUL IS NECESSARY BUT NOT SUFFICIENT. PERSUASION OF VOTERS IS ESSENTIAL. BOTH PARTIES KNNEED TO APPEAL TA WIDER RANGE OF VOTERS. HOW ABOUT VOTERS IN THE MIDDLE?  I AGREE WITH HIM. SWING IS KING. AND THAT IF YOU THINK OF THE MATH, THERE ARE TEN VOTERS AND YOU SWITCH ONE IT'S 6-4. IF YOU BRING SOMEBODY IN TURNOUT IT IS ONLY 6-5. INCREDIBLE POWER OF GETTING A SWING VOTER. NOT ONLY THAT, IT BRINGS THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. THAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME ABOUT WHAT DESANTIS DID IN FLORIDA. HE BROUGHT OVER PEOPLE WHO WERE DEMOCRATS IN LARGE NUMBERS SO HE APPEALED TO THE SWING VOTERS. MOST OF THIS CONTEST NATIONALLY IN A LOT OF THE OTHER SENATE RACES WAS JUST ABOUT BRINGING OUT THE BASE. THAT'S WHY THEY WERE ALWAYS 2 OR 3 POINTS ONE DIRECTION BECAUSE WHEN YOU JUST BRING OUT THE BASE IT REMAINS A DIVIDED COUNTRY. THE NET OF THE ELECTION IS THAT WE REMAIN A DIVIDED COUNTRY. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE CANDIDATES GO BACK TO COURTING SWING VOTERS WHICH NECESSARILY UNITES THE COUNTRY AFTER ELECTION DAY. I'M DISAPPOINTED WHEN CAMPAIGNS DON'T.  Mike: MARK PENN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ANALYSIS TODAY.  THANK YOU.  Gillian: THE SEARCH CONTINUES THIS HOUR FOR THE SUSPECTED KILLER OF FOUR UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO STUDENTS. WE'RE LEARNING NEW DETAILS ABOUT THE TIMELINE OF THE MURDERS. DR. MICHAEL BADEN JOINS US NEXT HOUR. A LAWYER FOR FTX IS SPEAKING OUT IN COURT ABOUT THE OLD CEO SAM BANKMAN-FRIED.

        "trs": "\u266a \u266a THAT VOICE INSIDE YOU SAY I'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE \u266a \u266a  Laura: D\u00c9J\u00c0 VU ALL OVER AGAIN, A SONG FROM JOHN MEDICAL CAMP AND OF COURSE A FAMOUS UTTERANCE FROM THE LATE GREAT YANKEE LEGEND YOGI BERRA AND CAN BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE LATEST DETAILS IN THE LATEST INVESTIGATION INTO FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER THE WIFE OF DISGRACED FORMER FBI AGENT McCABE WAS A DEMOCRAT OFFICE AND BIG DONOR TO FRIENDS OF THE CLINTONS. TURNS OUT THE WIFE OF RECENTLY APPOINTED SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH HAS SIMILAR ISSUES. REPORTS SUGGEST SHE WAS NOT ONLY A DONOR TO JOE BIDEN, BUT ALSO ONE OF THE PRODUCERS OF A MICHELLE OBAMA DOCUMENTARY. JOINING ME NOW IS MOLLIE HEMINGWAY EDITOR AND CHIEF AT THE FEDERALIST AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND STEVEN MILLER FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND AMERICA FIRST LEGAL FOUNDER. MOLLIE, THE LEFT'S RULES ARE NO RECUSE AL EVER.  RIGHT, THE LEFT SAYS IF THEY HAVE A SPOUSE THAT IS COMPROMISED NO RECUSAL AT ALL BUT ANYONE WHO'S A CONSERVATIVE WHO'S INVOLVED UNTIL LAW OR JUSTICE YOU HAVE TO RECUSE. HERE WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE SPOUSE OF THIS PERSON IS A DONOR, IS AN ACTIVIST. BUT EVEN MORE THAN THAT, WE KNOW THAT THIS PERSON, HIMSELF, WAS INVOLVED IN THE IRS SCANDAL. HE WAS INVOLVED IN PROSECUTING THE FORMER GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA WHO WAS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE A PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER, PROSECUTING HIM. THAT CONVICTION WAS OVERTURNED BY THE SCORE 9-0. I MEAN, THIS IS SOMEONE WHO, IF YOU WERE TRYING TO MAKE IT SEEM LIKE THIS WAS ABOVE BOARD, YOU REALLY COULD NOT HAVE DONE A WORSE JOB PICKING SOMEONE.  Laura: STEVEN SPEAKING OF SMITH, I'M GETTING SOME EARLY DAYS OF MUELLER VIBES HERE. CHECK THIS OUT.  HE'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED POLITICAL INDEPENDENT WE ARE TOLD AND WILL WORK THIS CASE WITHOUT FEAR OR FAR.  HE'S NOT SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO WASTE ANY TIME HAMMERING OVER THE SIDE SHOWS.  GIVEN HIS SKILL AND TENACITY AND HE'S KNOWN FOR BEING REALLY FAST AND CUTTING TO THE CHASE.  Laura: OKAY, THE TURTLENECK DOESN'T HELP WITH THE CREDIBILITY THERE. STEVEN, WASN'T THIS PREDICTABLE?  HE'S SO SKILLED LAURA, AND SO TENACIOUS. DID I HEAR THAT HE'S REGISTERED AS AN INDEPENDENT? UNBELIEVABLE. LOOK, LAURA, THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THE TOP LEVELS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ARE DEMOCRATS. WE HAVE SEEN THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. DOJ AT THE CAREER LEVEL IS RUN BY DEMOCRATS, THIS HE PROTECT EACH OTHER, THEY WATCH OUT FOR EACH OTHER, THEY TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER. THAT'S WHY ALL THE LEAKS DO ONLY ONE THING, HURT REPUBLICANS, THAT'S WHY ALL THE SPIN ONLY HELPS ONE GROUP, DEMOCRATS. THAT'S WHY ALL THE POLITICAL PROSECUTIONS ARE TARGETED IN ONE DIRECTION, TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS. THAT'S WHY PRO LIFERS GO TO JAIL AND THAT'S WHY PRO ABORTION TERRORISTS DON'T GO TO JAIL. WE ARE WITNESSING THE DEMISE OF THE RULE OF LAW IN THIS COUNTRY.  Laura: MOLLIE, I THINK IT'S SO BAD ON SO MANY LEVELS, AND IT'S A HUGE MISTAKE FOR THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AT A TIME WHERE THEY SAY THEY WANT TO RETURN TO NORMAL ORDER, UPHOLD INSTITUTIONS, REPUBLICANS AND CONSERVATIVES AND WHACKY MAGA PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO DISRUPT THE PROCESS ON JANUARY 6TH. BUT THEY'RE THE GREAT DISRUPTERS BECAUSE NOBODY BELIEVES THAT THIS GUY IS GOING TO BE WITHOUT FEAR OR FAVOR. I'M SO TIRED OF THAT PHRASE, TOO.  RIGHT. IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE IF THEY WERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY MEMBERS OF CORPORATE PRESS. BUT IF WE TAKE IT BACK A FEW YEARS, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FORMER PRESIDENT WHO WAS PERSECUTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. YOU HAD FBI AGENTS FALSIFYING EVIDENCE TO SECURE A WIRE TAP TO SPY ON HIS CAMPAIGN.  Laura: FISA COURT.  YOU HAD YEARS OF THESE POLITICIZED LEAKS. YOU HAVE HAD JUST REALLY REMARKABLY HORRIBLE BEHAVIOR. ALL OF THE DECISIONS MADE BY MERRICK GARLAND AND HIS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THROUGHOUT THIS BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN REALLY NOT APPROPRIATE GIVEN THAT PAST THAT'S THERE. THERE IS NO REASON WHY ANYBODY SHOULD HAVE ANY MODICUM OF TRUST IN WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY DON'T SEEM TO CARE. THEY'RE JUST FLAUNTING IT AT THIS POINT.  Laura: I NEED TO GET BOTH OF YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS. AN OHIO MAN WHO STOLE BOURBON AND A COAT RACK DURING THE CAPITOL RIOT JUST GOT THREE YEARS IN PRISON. THAT'S TWICE AS LONG AS THAT LEFTY LAWYER WHO FIRE BOMBED THE NYPD PATROL CAR WITH THAT MOLOTOV COCKTAIL DURING THE GEORGE FLOYD RIOT. STEVEN, THREE YEARS.  NO QUESTION THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS BEING USED TO SEND A MESSAGE AT ONLY ONE GROUP OF AMERICANS, AND THAT IS CONSERVATIVES. WE'VE SEEN THIS THROUGHOUT THE JANUARY 6TH CASES, BUT IN PARTICULAR WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT, WHEN YOU COMPARE IT TO WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH STREET CRIMINALS IN THIS COUNTRY, WITH BLM RIOTERS IN THIS COUNTRY, WITH ANTIFA TERRORISTS IN THIS COUNTRY, WITH PEOPLE WHO TRY TO MURDER POLICE OFFICERS IN THIS COUNTRY, WITH THE REVOLVING DOOR OF JUSTICE WHERE YOU CAN ATTACK AND ASSAULT AND MAIM, AND YOU CAN EVEN MURDER, AND YOU WILL BE SET FREE IN THIS COUNTRY. THERE IS NOT AND HAS NOT BEEN FOR A LONG TIME A SINGLE UNIFORM STANDARD OF JUSTICE WHICH IS WHAT WE DESPERATELY NEED.  Laura: MOLLIE, WHAT'S BEEN DONE TO SOME OF THESE JANUARY 6TH DEFENDANTS, PRETRIAL DETENTION FOR 20 MONTHS? I'M NOT SAYING WHAT THEY DID WAS GREAT BUT 20 MONTHS OF PRETRIAL DETENTION.  IT'S DESPICABLE.  Laura: NO REPUBLICANS ARE SPEAKING ABOUT IT, LAUREN BOEBERT AND MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE BUT VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT THESE PEOPLE.  THIS IS AFTER 2020 THAT SAW RIOTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, ATTACKS ON THE WHITE HOUSE, FEDERAL COURTHOUSES STATUS AND MONUMENTS. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WAS UNINTERESTED IN PROSECUTING THAT, THEY HAVE SPENT MORE MONEY AND BEEN MORE TENACIOUS IN GOING AFTER THESE PEOPLE. SOME OF WHOM -- ALL POLITICAL VIOLENCE IS BAD, SOME PEOPLE WERE LET INTO THE CAPITOL AND REPUBLICANS ARE SCARED TO TALK ABOUT IT. THAT IS A VERY BAD SIGN BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ABOUT THE RULE OF LAW AND HOW MUCH IS BEING -- HOW MUCH WE HAVE TWO STANDARDS OF JUSTICE SO A VERY BIG PROBLEM.  Laura: YEAH, CRIME SHOULD BE PROSECUTED BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE DISPROPORTIONATELY PROSECUTED COMPARED TO THE VIOLENT CRIME STEVEN WAS RELAYING. MOLLIE AND STEVEN WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU BOTH. THANK YOU  NOW THE PRESIDENT PARDONS TURKEYS AND THE DEMOCRATS PONDER BIDEN'S FUTURE. RAYMOND ARROYO HAS IT ALL. SEEN AND UNSEEN IS NEXT. .  Laura:.  Laura: IT'S TIME FOR OUR SEEN AND UNSEEN SEGMENT WHERE WE EXPLORE OUR CULTURAL STORIES THE DAY AND FOR THAT WE TURN TO THE WEISSMANN WHO FOUND CHRISTMAS FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR RAYMOND ARROYO. BIDEN MARKED A HUGE MILESTONE THIS WEEKEND I UNDERSTAND.  HE DID INDEED, JOE BIDEN TURNED 80 MAKING HIM THE OLDEST PRESIDENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY. DEMOCRATS ARE MULLING WHETHER BIDEN SHOULD RUN IN 2024. IN THE MEANTIME THEY'RE PUBLICLY BOBBING AND WEAVING AROUND THE QUESTION OR JUST FREEZING UP.  DO YOU HOPE THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL RUN AGAIN IN 2024?  YOU KNOW, I, I, I -- I WILL HAVE TO SEE.  YOU KNOW, HE'S OUR PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW, HE HAS EXPERIENCE, HE HAS QUALIFICATIONS. I WON'T SAY IF HE'S FIT OR IF HE'S NOT. I'LL JUST SAY THIS. HE HAS THE QUALIFICATIONS TO RUN.  DO YOU WANT TO SEE PRESIDENT BIDEN, SENATOR, RUN FOR A SECOND TERM?  WELL, WHAT I WANT TO SEE RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, WORKING WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN NEXT YEAR.  RAYMOND --  THAT'S NOT EXACTLY AN ANSWER.  WHAT WERE THOSE SESAME STREET CHARACTERS ON SPLIT SCREENS.  THE MUPPETS. HE'S ONE DEFINITELY.  Laura: IT HASHINGENED BACK TO THAT THAT SPLIT SCREEN.  IT'S ALSO A WALL STREET JOURNAL OF VOTE CAST STUDY, A POLL, AND THEY FOUND THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THOSE RESPONDING THOUGHT BIDEN LACKED THE MENTAL CAPACITY TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT. THAT IS GOING TO RATTLE HIS POSSIBILITIES AND HIS CANDIDACY.  Laura: BUT RAYMOND, THAT'S NOT FAIR. YOU GET SHARPER WITH AGE, RIGHT? YEAH.  OH, SURE. BIDEN TODAY SHOWED WHY THERE ARE CONCERNS TODAY. AT THE WHITE HOUSE HE PARDONED A PAIR OF TURKEYS NAMED CHOCOLATE AND CHIP NOT JAMES AND HUNTER.  NINE AND A HALF MILLION TURKEYS, I TELL YOU WHAT THAT'S LIKE SOME OF THE COUNTRIES I'VE BEEN TO. ANYWAY. CHOCOLATE IS MY FAVORITE, CHOCOLATE IS MY FAVORITE ICE CREAM, SO I COULD HAVE -- WE COULD HAVE NAMED THEM CHIPS AND SCIENCE. DO YOU WANT TO TALK?  THAT MAY BE MY FAVORITE MOMENT LAURA.  Laura: WHAT?  DO YOU WANT TO TALK? TO THE TURKEY. AT THAT POINT GIVEN THE INFLATION NUMBERS I THOUGHT MAYBE THE TURKEY SHOULD PARDON BIDEN BUT IT DIDN'T WORK OUT THAT WAY. HE PARDONED BOTH CHOCOLATE APPEAR CHIP OR AS BIDEN CALLED THEM CHOCOLATE CHIP AND CHIP.  Laura: DO YOU KNOW WHO WAS REALLY FUNNY? TRUMP WAS REALLY FUNNY WITH THE PARDONING WITH THE TURKEYS BECAUSE HE'S A NATURAL PERFORMER. THAT WAS ACTUALLY FUN. THIS ROUTINE WAS, WELL, PLUCKED.  THERE WAS ANOTHER ODD MOMENT WHEN HE RECOGNIZED HIS GRANDCHILDREN LAURA.  THAT'S MY GRANDSON BEAU UP THERE AND MY GRANDDAUGHTER. DON'T LET THEM JUMP.  NOTHING SAYS HAPPY THANKSGIVING LIKE MY GRANDCHILDREN WERE ABOUT TO JUMP FROM THE TRUMAN BALCONY. HE'S USED THIS BEFORE.  DON'T JUMP, YOU LOOK CRAZY ENOUGH TO JUMP. DON'T JUMP.  DON'T JUMP, DON'T JUMP.  AND DON'T JUMP FROM UP THERE, OKAY.  WHY DOES HE SAY THAT? I GET IT PEOPLE ARE IN SUCH AGONY THEY'LL PROBABLY THROW THEMSELVES OFF THE ROOFS OR BALCONIES.  Laura: THANK YOU. THEY COULD BE PUTTING THEMSELVES OUT OF THEIR MISERY JUST TO GET THROUGH ANOTHER SERIES OF BIDEN TURKEY JOKES. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE.  THE TURKEY PARDON BARELY FINISHED WHEN JILL BIDEN WENT OUT TO RECEIVE THE WHITE HOUSE CHRISTMAS TREE. AT THIS RATE NEW YEAR'S EVE COULD BE BECOMING TONIGHT AT MIDNIGHT. COULD WE TAKE A BREATH BETWEEN THE SEASONS, ELECTIONS GO ON FOR FOUR WEEKS BUT THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS IS OVER IN AN AFTERNOON WITH THE BIDENS. NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT.  Laura: THAT'S A QUICKIE. BUT RAYMOND THEY HAD THE CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS UP IN LIKE THE PHARMACIES AND STUFF, THEY WERE UP IN LIKE SEPTEMBER, LATE SEPTEMBER, BECAUSE THEY HAVE SO MUCH BACKED UP INVENTORY.  THE RETAILERS, YEAH, THEY'RE ALWAYS PUSHING EARLY. LOOK, IN 2019, THE TRUMPS ANOTHER HAD THE TURKEY PARDON AND THE TREE REVEAL ON THE SAME DAY.  Laura: BE FAIR. A STORY IN THE NEW YORK TIMES IS CLAIMING THAT JUSTICE ALITO LEAKED THE HOBBY LOBBY DECISION BACK IN 2014 TO A DINNER COMPANION. ONLY THE SUPPOSED SOURCE IN THE JUSTICE INSISTS THE STORY IS TOTALLY FALSE. RIGHT?  YEAH, THIS NEW YORK TIMES PIECE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO BLAME ALITO FOR THE DOBBS LEAK. WHICH MAKES NO SENSE, WHY WOULD HE EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THREATS AND PRESSURE BEFORE ROWE WAS OVERTURNED. I CAME UP WITH A SNOW STUDY THAT TOUCHES ON THE DOBBS DECISION. SINCE ROWE WAS OVERTURNED A MATCH.COM STUDY FOUND ONE IN FIVE COUPLES SAY THEY ARE MORE HESITANT TO HAVE SEX. FOUR IN FIVE CLAIM THEY HAVE CHANGED THEIR DATA BEHAVIOR SINCE THE RULING. THAT'S INTERESTING. THAT KIND OF REFLECTION I PERSONALLY THINK IS A GOOD THING FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE AND TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF YOUR ACTIONS, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO A LIFE HANGING IN THE BALANCE.  Laura: I HAVE A QUESTION, IS MATCH.COM RIGHT UP THERE WITH GALLOP AND ALL THE OTHER POLLING ORGANIZATIONS?  THEY COMMISSIONED THE POLL. THEY DIDN'T DO IT THEMSELVES LAURA.  Laura: I GOT IT. ALL RIGHT HAPPY THANKS -- RAYMOND, HAPPY THANKSGIVING EVE BECAUSE YOU'RE FILLING IN FOR ME I UNDERSTAND. THAT'S GOING TO BE FUN.  WE HAVE AN ALL STAR CAST JUST WAITING TO FILL THE GAP THERE. AND I'LL TRY TO KEEP THE SEAT WARM LAURA.  Laura: AWESOME. ALL RIGHT RAYMOND HAPPY THANKSGIVING. GREAT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT  THE INVESTIGATION INTO MURDERS OF FOUR UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO STUDENTS GROWS MORE BIZARRE BY THE DAY. WHILE THERE IS STILL NO SUSPECT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE OTHER VIOLENT ACTS THAT OCCURRED IN THE COMMUNITIES IN THE WEEKS LEADING UP TO THE INSULATION. DETAILS ON THAT IN MOMENTS. 20221122034314.222|20221122034801.676",

        "trs": "> THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT. WE ARE FOLLOWING THE CASE OF FOR IDAHO COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO WERE BRUTALLY MURDERED. LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE RELEASED NEW INFORMATION AS THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES. MATT FINN IS LIVE IN THE WEST COAST NEWSROOM WITH THE LATEST. MAT?  Reporter: TONIGHT MORE THAN A FULL WEEK AFTER THOSE FOR UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO STUDENTS WERE STABBED TO DEATH, POLICE HAVE NOT ANNOUNCED ANY SUSPECTS. A KILLER OR KILLERS ARE ON THE LOOSE. NOW POLICE ARE ASKING EVERYONE IN A LARGE AREA NEAR THE MURDER SCENE TO CHECK CAMERAS FOR VIDEO EVIDENCE. THE MOSCOW POLICE CHIEF SAYS THE KILLER WAS SLOPPY AND THERE WAS NO SIGNS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. POLICE SAY A SURVIVING ROOMMATE'S PHONE WAS USED TO CALL 911 AROUND NOON SUNDAY, BUT WOULD NOT SAY IF A ROOMMATE MADE THE CALL. THE CHIEF SAYS SEVERAL PEOPLE WERE INSIDE THE HOUSE BEFORE COPS ARRIVED. THEY THOUGHT THEIR FRIENDS WERE PASSED OUT. POLICE DO NOT BELIEVE THE TWO SURVIVING ROOMMATES WERE INVOLVED. POLICE ALSO RULED OUT A MAN SEEN IN A WHITE HOODIE IN SURVEILLANCE VIDEO WITH TWO VICTIMS JUST HOURS BEFORE THEIR DEATHS. POLICE SAY THEY HAVE ALSO CLEARED A PRIVATE PARTY WHO GAVE RIDES HOME TO KAILEE GUN SOLVES AND MADISON EARLY LAST SUNDAY. INVESTIGATORS ALSO SAY THEY HAVE CLEARED A MALE SUBJECT THAT WAS CALLED FROM MADISON AND KAILEE'S PHONE MULTIPLE TIMES THE NIGHT THEY WERE KILLED. INVESTIGATORS VISITED LOCAL BUSINESSES TO SEE IF ANY FIXED BLADE KNIVES MIGHT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY PURCHASED. ALSO TONIGHT MOSCOW POLICE DID WHAT THEY CALLED RUMOR CONTROL AND CLARIFIED THAT AN INCIDENT INVOLVING A DOG THAT WAS RECENTLY SKINNED NEARBY IS NOT RELATED TO THIS CASE.  SAD AND JUST A MYSTERY THAT KEEPS GETTING BIGGER. THANK YOU. > TURNING TO THE STATE OF GEORGIA WHERE A CRITICAL SENATE RUNOFF IS ABOUT TWO WEEKS AWAY. FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA ANNOUNCED TODAY HE WILL BE AGAIN CAMPAIGNING WITH RAPHAEL WARNOCK ON THURSDAY BEFORE THE ELECTION DURING THE EARLY VOTING PERIOD. THERE IS NO WORD YET ON WEATHER PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL SHOW OF FOR WARNOCK. REMEMBER HOW CRITICAL THIS RUNOFF IS WITH A 51 SEAT MAJORITY. DEMOCRATS WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE AS MANY RADICAL JUDICIAL AND OTHER APPOINTMENTS THAT THEY WANT. WITH THE HELP OF RAPHAEL WARNOCK A GUARANTEED RUBBERSTAMP VOTE FOR ANY FAR LEFT DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION OR POLICY. HERE WITH REACTION IS LOUISIANA SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR VICTORY. WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GIVE IT VERY MUCH ATTENTION. THE PEOPLE OF LOUISIANA KNOW A GOOD THING WHEN THEY SEE IT. CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU. HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK THIS RACE IS AND HOW DO YOU SEE IT UNFOLDING?  WELL, A NEUTRAL OBSERVER MIGHT POINT OUT, SEAN, THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME INTO GEORGIA FOR MS. STACEY ABRAMS AND HER GUBERNATORIAL BID AND IT DIDN'T SEEM TO HELP HER VERY MUCH. IF I WERE RUNNING SENATOR WARNOCK'S CAMPAIGN I WOULD CERTAINLY BRING IN PRESIDENT OBAMA BEFORE BRINGING IN PRESIDENT BIDEN. AS I HAVE TOLD YOU BEFORE, I DON'T HATE ANYONE, BUT AT THIS JUNCTURE THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION I THINK IS BEST KNOWN FOR ITS WORLD-CLASS ACUITY ACCORDING TO THE POLLS, MOST AMERICANS WOULDN'T TRUST PRESIDENT BIDEN TO SALT THE FRIES AT MCDONALD'S. NOW, AS TO GEORGIA, IN A 50/50 SENATE WHICH WILL HAVE IF MR. WALKER IS ELECTED. IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO BEAT BACK THE BERSERK WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT VOTES IN THE SENATE. IT'S ALSO ABOUT VALUES IN AMERICA, IN MY OPINION. HERSCHEL WALKER UNDERSTANDS THAT VETTING PEOPLE AT THE BORDER IS NOT RACIST. IT'S PRUDENT. HERSCHEL WALKER UNDERSTANDS THAT THE CRIMINALS ARE NOT THE GOOD GUYS. THEY ARE THE BAD GUYS. HERSCHEL WALKER UNDERSTANDS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AN ELECTION DAY, NOT AN ELECTION MONTH. AND HERSCHEL WALKER UNDERSTANDS THAT ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY CONTAINS FOR HUNDRED THOUSAND REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD STAND YOUR ASS UP FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM. THAT IS REALLY WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT. AND THE FINAL POINT I WOULD MAKE, TO THE GOOD PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, IF NOTHING I HAVE SAID HAS PERSUADED YOU, HERE IS WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO. BEFORE YOU GO TO THE POLLS, GO GROCERY SHOPPING, FILL UP YOUR GAS TANK AND PAY YOUR ELECTRIC BILL. AND THEN ASK YOURSELF HOW YOU VOTE.  I CANNOT GET OVER THE MYSTERIOUS RELUCTANCE AND RESISTANCE DEMOCRATS HAVE TOWARDS MAKING ANY FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES WHEN IT COMES TO ANYTHING. BIDEN WAS ASKED WHAT HE WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY AFTER THE MIDTERMS AND HIS ANSWER WAS NOTHING. OKAY. NOW WE ARE GOING TO HAVE 45% INCREASES IN AREAS IN THE COUNTRY TO HEAT THEIR HOMES. GAS PRICES NOW BEGINNING THE RAPID CLIMB ONCE AGAIN IS NOT TAPPING INTO THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVES. WE ARE BACK GIVING MBS A FREE PASS FOR THE KILLING OF JAMAL KASHOGGI AND GIVE HIM IMMUNITY? DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A GOOD IDEA TO YOU? SOUNDS LIKE JOE IS SUCKING UP TO OPEC AND THE SAUDI ARABIANS AND FOR THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR ECONOMY WHEN WE HAVE PLENTY OF ENERGY AT HOME.  THESE MIDTERM ELECTIONS WERE NOT AN ENDORSEMENT OF PRESIDENT BIDEN. THESE ELECTIONS WERE AN ENDORSEMENT OF DIVIDED GOVERNMENT. THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT. THE POLLS ABOUT THE RED WAVE WERE SIMPLY WRONG. I AM NOT SURE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN BE PULLED RIGHT NOW. IT WASN'T AN ENDORSEMENT OF PRESIDENT BIDEN. NOT BY A LONGSHOT. IT WAS AN ENDORSEMENT OF DIVIDED GOVERNMENT. I AM GOING TO KEEP GETTING UP EVERY DAY AND FIGHTING FOR WHAT I THINK OR THE VALUES AND HOW TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT MOST AMERICANS, MOMS AND DADS, WORRY ABOUT WHEN THEY CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT. I HOPE THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL. WITH US. I HAVE SEEN NO INDICATION THAT HE WILL. I CANNOT THINK OF ONE PROBLEM IN AMERICA TODAY THAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HASN'T ANSWERED TOO. I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO SAY THAT. I JUST CAN'T.  I CANNOT THINK OF IT EITHER. THE POOR AND THE MIDDLE CLASS ARE SUFFERING ON MIDDLE-CLASS INCOMES. I SEE THINGS GETTING DRAMATICALLY WORSE BEFORE WE EVEN HAD A SHOT OF GETTING THEM BETTER. SENATOR KENNEDY, I APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH IS ALWAYS. THANK YOU. > WITH REPUBLICANS ONCE AGAIN SET TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, KEVIN McCARTHY HAS PLEDGED TO MAKE BIG CHANGES AND REMOVE PROMINENT DEMOCRATS FROM THE COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS INCLUDING CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR WHO HAS MADE A NUMBER OF ANTI- SOMATIC COMMENTS IN THE PAST. THAT WOULD INCLUDE ADAM SCHIFF WHO HAS BEEN CAUGHT LYING COUNTLESS OF TIMES AS A CONGRESSMAN. IT WENT ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS. TAKE A LOOK. 2 DONALD TRUMP IS SOMEONE WHO HAS SHOWN WHEN HE IS NOT HELD ACCOUNTABLE GOES ON TO COMMIT WORSE AND WORSE ABUSES OF POWER. I AGREE WITH JUDGE CARTER IN CALIFORNIA. THERE WAS EVIDENCE THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT ENGAGED IN MULTIPLE VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW AND THAT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED. WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ENGAGED IN A SHAKEDOWN OF A FOREIGN PRESIDENT. PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES EVEN AS HE IS WITHHOLDING VITAL MILITARY SUPPORT TO AN ALLY ASKING A FAVOR OF THAT ALLY TO INVESTIGATE HIS OPPONENT.  I HAVE BEEN VERY CLEAR OVER THE PAST YEAR, YEAR AND A HALF THAT THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION IN PLAIN SIGHT.  I CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA.  THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN ON THE ISSUE OF COLLUSION IF YOU ARE WILLING TO SEE IT.  NOBODY SAW IT EXCEPT HIM. BUT HE DID MORE THAN JUST LIE. HE ACTUALLY SAW OUT COMPROMISING INFORMATION ON DONALD TRUMP FROM RUSSIA WITHOUT REALIZING HE THOUGHT THE PERSON HE WAS SPEAKING TO WAS A RUSSIAN OFFICIAL WHO HAD DIRT ON DONALD TRUMP. BUT HE HIMSELF WAS BEING DUPED ABOUT COMPROMISING MATERIALS. TAKE A LOOK.  SHE BROUGHT HIM A RUSH GIRL WHO IS ALSO KNOWN AS A PERSON WITH A STRANGE REPUTATION.  HOW DO YOU SPELL HER NAME WHAT IS THE NATURE OF THE COMPROMISE?  NAKED PICTURES OF DRUM.  BOUDIN WAS MADE AWARE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF THE COMPROMISING MATERIAL?  YES, OF COURSE.  THANK YOU. WE WILL BE BACK IN TOUCH WITH YOU THROUGH OUR STAFF TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO OBTAIN THESE MATERIALS FOR OUR COMMITTEE AND THE FBI. I APPRECIATE YOU REACHING OUT TO US.  HE IS COLLUDING TO GET COMPROMISING MATERIALS. NOW MACCARTHY McCARTHY HAS THREATENED TO BAR ERIC SWALWELL WHO SITS ON THE HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE DESPITE HAVING A PAST RELATIONSHIP WITH A SUSPECTED CHINESE SPY. ALL THREE MEMBERS RESPONDED WITH OUTRAGE TOWARD McCARTHY AND REPUBLICANS, BUT AS NEWT GINGRICH REMINDED EVERYONE IT WAS NANCY PELOSI THAT SET THE PRECEDENT AFTER MOVING PAUL GOES HER AND MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE FROM THEIR COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS. NEWT GINGRICH, FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE JOINS US WITH MORE. I THINK THAT'S THE FUNNY PART OF IT. THEY ARE ALL OUTRAGED ABOUT IT, BUT THEY SET THE STANDARD. NOW THE RULES APPLY TO THEM AND THEY DON'T LIKE IT.  THAT IS TYPICAL OF THE DEMOCRATS. THEY THINK IF THEY CHEAT IT IS OKAY. IF YOU ARE HONEST, YOU MUST BE CHEATING. I THINK PELOSI AT THE TIME I SAID THIS WAS A TERRIBLE PRECEDENT. THIS SETS THE STAGE FOR THE MAJORITY PARTY TO DECIDE WHO GETS TO SERVE ON EVERY COMMITTEE AND SHE WENT AHEAD AND DID IT. ALL OF THESE FOLKS SUPPORTED HER IN DOING IT. NOW IT HAS COME BACK AROUND TO BITE THEM. FRANKLY, THE THREE PEOPLE THAT THE SPEAKER DESIGNATED McCARTHY HAS PICKED ARE PERFECT EXAMPLES. OMAR IS AN OPENLY ANTI- ANTI-SEMITIC, ANTI- ISRAELI BIGOT. SHE CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE IN THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE. ERIC SWALWELL HAS VARIOUS RELATIONS WITH CHINESE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SPIES. HE CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE ON THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. AND FRANKLY, IF I COULD HAVE DONE IT I WOULD HAVE HAD THEM ON NO COMMITTEE AT ALL. SCHIFF IS A LIAR. HE WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE. HE USED THAT POST WHICH PRESUMABLY GAVE HIM UNIQUE KNOWLEDGE AND HE JUST RETUNED ONLY LIED. EVERY LIE WAS A SMEAR OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I HAVE NO SYMPATHY FOR ANY OF THE THREE OF THEM. I AM VERY PROUD THAT SPEAKER DESIGNATE McCARTHY HAS IN FACT FOLLOWED THROUGH ON HIS COMMITMENT AND IS GOING TO TAKE THEM OFF THEIR COMMITTEES.  WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE NOW THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE PRETTY SIMILAR MAJORITY AS THE LAST CONGRESS WHERE THE DEMOCRATS HAD CONTROL? OBVIOUSLY IN THE JUDICIARY JIM JORDAN WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE FBI HAS BEEN POLITICIZED AND THE DOJ WEAPONIZE. THEN CONGRESSMAN COMER IS LOOKING INTO HUNTER AND JOE BIDEN. THIS IS AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. I HAVE OFTEN POINTED OUT THAT MOST PEOPLE ARE MISSING THE OBVIOUS AND THAT WAS THERE WAS A REASON THAT JOE WITHHELD A BILLION DOLLARS FROM UKRAINE. THERE IS A REASON THAT HUNTER COMPLAINS BITTERLY ABOUT ALL THE MONEY HE HAS TO PAY HIS DAD. APPARENTLY NOW ACCORDING TO CONGRESSMAN COMER THEY ARE BANKING RECORDS THAT WILL CORROBORATE JOE BIDEN FINANCIALLY BENEFITED FROM HIS ZEROTH EXPERIENCED SON MAKING ALL THESE DEALS WITH UP TO 50 COUNTRIES, MAKING MILLIONS WITH NO EXPERIENCE WITH ANY OF THEM. AND SOME OF OUR MOST HOSTILE REGIMES OUT THERE, CHINA, RUSSIA, ET CETERA.  FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. FRANKLY, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA GOT FROM THE CHINESE COMMUNISTS. HOW MUCH OF THAT WENT TO JOE BIDEN AND WHAT WAS IN EFFECT A WHITE HOUSE STAFF WAITING IN THE WINGS. ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN KEPT SECRET. THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA WILL NOT ADMIT HOW MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IT TOOK. THERE IS A LOT THAT OUGHT TO BE LOOKED AT. MY ADVICE WOULD BE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WOULD LIKE THIS CONGRESS TO BE 10% INVESTIGATIONS AND 90% SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE A LOT OF REAL PROBLEMS AND WE NEED REAL ACTION ON A WIDE RANGE OF THINGS. I LIKE THE FACT THAT SPEAKER DESIGNATE McCARTHY SAID THE VERY FIRST VOTE IS GOING TO PICK OUT THE 87,000 INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AGENTS. THAT'S A POLICY DECISION, NOT JUST AN INVESTIGATION. MY ADVICE IS TWOFOLD. ONE, TRY TO DISCIPLINE YOURSELF SO IT'S 90% GOOD SOLUTIONS, 10% INVESTIGATIONS. THAT IS PLENTY OF TIME TO GET A LOT DONE. SECOND, HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE TO LEARN TO BE A TEAM. THEY CAN HAVE ALL THE FIGHTS IN THE CONFERENCE THEY WANT. THIS RECENT SUGGESTION THAT SOME OF THEM MIGHT NOT VOTE FOR McCARTHY ON JANUARY 3RD IS SO SUICIDAL AND SO STUPID. YOU REALLY HAVE TO WONDER WHERE THEY ARE AT. DO THEY WANT TO SEE THE MODERATE REPUBLICANS JOIN THE DEMOCRATS IN GETTING SOME KIND OF COALITION SPEAKER? WHAT IS THERE AND GAME OTHER THAN THROWING A TEMPER TANTRUM? THEY CAN HAVE ALL THE FIGHTS THEY WANT INSIDE THE CONFERENCE. THEY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER WHEN THEY ARE ON THE FLOOR.  YOU SAID ABOUT THIS ELECTION HERE THAT FOR YOU TO FULLY UNDERSTAND IT, YOU HAVE TO THROW AWAY EVERY MODEL THAT YOU KNEW IN PASSED ELECTIONS. I HAVE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID AND I THINK VOTING NOW IN THE LAST TWO ELECTIONS, THE WAY WE VOTE WITH MAIL-IN VOTING, ABSENTEE AND EARLY VOTING, ALL THE STUFF, THAT HAS CHANGED PRETTY DRASTICALLY IN THE COUNTRY. I'M NOT SURE IF REPUBLICANS HAVE BOUGHT INTO IT. I CAN'T RECONCILE THE REPUBLICANS WINNING THE POPULAR VOTE BY SUCH A LARGE MARGIN AND NOT WINNING BY A BIGGER MARGIN. THEN WE HAVE THIS THING THAT I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU ABOUT, ACCELERATED MIGRATION AND LEAVING BLUE STATES TO AVOID SHUTDOWNS, LOCKDOWNS. THEY WANT THEIR KIDS TO HAVE IN-PERSON LEARNING AND LOWER TAXES SO THEY MOVED TO RED STATES TO GET REDDER. BUT SWING STATES LIKE MICHIGAN AND WISCONSIN AND PENNSYLVANIA WILL GET HIT HARDER. ABORTION PLAYED A BIGGER PART IN THE ELECTION THAN ANY OF US THOUGHT IT WOULD. AND YOUNG PEOPLE I THINK WANTED THEIR STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS. THEY SEEM TO SHOW UP IN BIG NUMBERS. WHAT HAVE YOU GLEANED FROM THE INFORMATION SO FAR?  A COUPLE THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, THE REPUBLICAN MODEL FOR CAMPAIGNING, THE REPUBLICAN CONSULTANTS ARE WRONG. THEY ARE OBSOLETE. DEMOCRATS FOCUS ON ELECTIONS. REPUBLICANS FOCUS ON CAMPAIGNS. DEMOCRATS BEGAN GATHERING UP THE VERY EARLY. THEY WORK AT IT VERY METHODICALLY. SOME OF THE REPUBLICANS, FRANKLY THE TRUTH IS THAT SENATOR McCONNELL WAS A MAJOR PROBLEM HERE BECAUSE HIS SUPER PACK WHICH IS A HUGE SOURCE OF MONEY REFUSED TO SPEND MONEY EARLY. IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE EARLY VOTING AND COME OUT OF A PRIMARY, THE DEMOCRAT SPENDS TWO OR THREE MONTHS DEFINING THE REPUBLICAN AND THEN THE PEOPLE START TO VOTE. BY THE TIME McCONNELL STARTS TO SPEND HIS MONEY, HALF THE VOTES ARE ALREADY IN. YOU JUST HAVE AN OBSOLETE MODEL. REPUBLICANS HAVE TO LOOK AT REALITY. EARLY VOTING ISRAEL. IN SOME STATES BALLOT BOXES STUFFING IS REAL. SOMEPLACE YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT TO GET PEOPLE TO VOTE EARLY AND STICK TO IT. YOU ALSO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WE DON'T HAVE AN ELECTION DAY. WE NOW HAVE AN ELECTION SIX WEEKS. REPUBLICANS ARE NOT READY FOR THAT.  I TELL YOU THE LAST THING.

Bill: SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ALITO DENYING ALLEGATIONS HE OR HIS WIFE LEAKED THE 2014 BURWELL VERSUS HOBBY LOBBY DECISION ON CONTRACEPTION WEEKS BEFORE IT WAS ANNOUNCED. MIKE, WHAT'S THE STORY?  GOOD MORNING TO YOU. JUSTICE ALITO DENIED AN ALLEGATION FROM A FORMER PRO-LIFE ACTIVIST THAT A DONOR TO HIS ORGANIZATION WAS TOLD THE OUTCOME OF A HIGH PROFILE CASE BEFORE IT WAS ANNOUNCED. THE HOBBY LOBBY CASE. HE SAID THE ALLEGATIONS THAT THE WRITHES WERE TOLD THE OUTCOME OF THE DECISION IN THE HOBBY LOBBY CASE OR THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE OPINION OF THE COURT BY ME OR MY WIFE STREET COMPLETELY FALSE. A REVEREND SAYS A DONOR RELAYED THE INFORMATION. HE SPENT YEARS AS AN ACTIVIST IN THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT AND NOW SAYS HIS VIEWS ON ABORTION HAVE SHIFTED IN RECENT YEARS. THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ARE RESPONDING SAYING THE COURT NEEDS TO GET ITS HOUSE IN ORDER AND ADOPT A BINDING CODE OF ETHICS JUST HAVE THE LOWER COURTS HAVE AND BRING IT IN LINE WITH OTHER BRANCHES GOVERNMENT. AFTER THE BLOCKBUSTER LEAK OF ALITO'S DRAFT OPINION OF THE ROE V. WADE AND LED TO MASSIVE PROTESTS IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT. A SHOCKING BREACH OF THE HIGH COURT'S PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL DELIBERATIONS. CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS ANNOUNCED AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ORIGINS OF THE LEAK SOON AFTER THE INFORMATION WAS PUBLISHED IN EARLY MAY. SO FAR ANY FINDINGS HAVE NOT BEEN RELEASED PUBLICLY.  Bill: STORY THERE. MIKE EMANUEL IN WASHINGTON.  Dana: STUNNING SHAKE-UP AT DISNEY, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE RETURN OF BOB IGER AS CEO LESS THAN A YEAR INTO HIS RETIREMENT WILL REPLACE SHAPE CHAPEK. HE HAD A TERRIBLE YEAR.  INCLUDING THE FACT MAKING IT MORE OF A SURPRISE THAT HE SIGNED A NEW THREE-YEAR DEAL THIS PAST SUMMER AND ALTHOUGH HE MEDDLED IN DISNEY'S BOARD OF DIRECTOR DECISION DIDN'T SHOW A WILLINGNESS TO COME BACK. WHAT THIS IS, DANA, IS THE STORY OF LEADERSHIP. IN THIS RESPECT. CHAPEK GOT INTO A TANGLE WITH RON DESANTIS OF FLORIDA. WHAT HE REVEALED AND HIS WEAKNESS WAS IN THAT IT WAS DISNEY BECAME A PLACE RUN BY ITS EMPLOYEES AND GRIEVANCES AND SENSITIVITIES. AT FIRST HE SAT OUT OF THE SCRAPE IN FLORIDA, BUT THEN THE EMPLOYEES DEMANDED YOU GET IN AND TAKE A STAND. WHETHER OR NOT HE WANTED TO IN THE BEGINNING OR WHETHER OR NOT HE CAVED IN THE END, THAT REVEALS THERE IS NO LEADERSHIP AT THE TOP. BE CAREFUL. I THINK IGER IS A STRONG VOICE. I THINK IGER WILL TAKE A STRONG STAND ON WHATEVER IT IS HE BELIEVES. WHAT HE BELIEVES IS REALLY PROGRESSIVE VALUES. THAT'S WHAT WILL DRIVE DISNEY'S DECISIONS. I BELIEVE IGER WOULD HAVE STOOD UP IN FLORIDA. HE WOULD HAVE STOOD UP AGAINST RON DESANTIS. HE WOULD BE MORE THE CONTINUED WOKE OF DISNEY. IF YOU ARE A DISNEY SUBSCRIBER OR FAN OR CUSTOMER, BE PREPARED THEY ARE TELLING YOU THIS IS OUR VISION OF THE FUTURE, STRONG, PROGRESSIVE VOICE.  Dana: INTERESTING TO SEE ALL THAT HAPPEN. SENATOR MARK WARNER OF VIRGINIA, A DEMOCRAT, HAS BEEN ON THERE FOR A LOOKING TIME NOW AND REVEALED HE AGREES WITH DONALD TRUMP ON SOMETHING AND THAT IS IN BANNING TIKTOK FROM THE UNITED STATES. WATCH HIM HERE.  I THINK DONALD TRUMP WAS RIGHT. TIKTOK IS AN ENORMOUS THREAT. IF YOU ARE A PARENT AND YOU HAVE A KID ON TIKTOK, I WOULD BE VERY, VERY CONCERNED. ALL OF THAT DATA THAT YOUR CHILD IS INPUTTING AND RECEIVING IS BEING STORED SOMEWHERE IN BEIJING.  THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR SAID THIS LAST WEEK.  CHINA'S VAST HACKING PROGRAM IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST BY THE MILE. THEY HAVE STOLEN MORE OF AMERICA'S PERSONAL AND BUSINESS DATA MORE THAN ANY OTHER NATION COMBINED.  Bill: THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS TO MAKE DECISIONS. WHAT SHOULD THEY DO?  WELL, YOU KNOW, DANA, WHEN IT COMES TO THIS IDEA YOUR PHONE IS SPYING ON YOU AND STEALING ALL THE INFORMATION. THERE ARE A LOT OF US THAT SAY I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING BAD AND I NEED THESE APPS. A BIG PART OF MY LIFE. WHAT DO I GIVE UP IN TERMS OF GIVING UP MY INFORMATION? IN AN EXTENDED CLIP WARNER AND DONALD TRUMP ARE POINTING OUT HERE IS WHAT YOU ARE GIVING UP WHEN IT COMES TO TIKTOK. YOUR 14-YEAR-OLD'S INFORMATION TO CHINA. WHAT VALUE IS THAT? HOW DOES IT HARM YOUR FAMILY? HERE IS HOW. HELP USE THE DATA TO PUSH OTHER CONTENT SUGGESTED TO YOUR CHILD. THINK HOW MUCH TIME I GIVE AND EVERYBODY WATCHING GIVES TO RAISING YOUR CHILD. HELPING SHAPE YOUR WORLDVIEW AND PRINCIPLES AND VALUES. WELL, NOW CHINA HAS ALL THAT DATA TO PUSH ONTO A GENERATION, ONTO A CULTURE, AN ENTIRE SOCIETY INFLUENCE THROUGH THE FORM OF CHECK OUT THIS NEXT POINT OF VIEW AND VIDEO. HOW DO YOU THINK WE GET A GENERATION OF PEOPLE ARE AGAINST THE VERY AMERICAN VALUE OF FREE SPEECH? THROUGH CULTURAL SHIFTS. THIS POINTS OUT WE'RE HANDING OVER HOURS, HOW MANY HOURS A DAY ARE OUR CHILDREN WATCHING THIS STUFF? HOURS OF SHAPING AMERICAN'S WORLDVIEW TO THE CHINESE.  Dana: REMEMBER JUST FOR EVERYBODY AT HOME, CHINA ONLY ALLOWS PEOPLE IN CHINA, ESPECIALLY KIDS, TO LOOK AT TIKTOK FOR 40 MINUTES TOTAL IN A DAY AND ALSO REALLY CONTROL THE CONTENT. SO YOU GET HAPPY THINGS OR NICE EXPERIMENT THINGS. IT IS NOT LIKE WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IN AMERICAN TIKTOK. THAT DEBATE RAGES ON. WILL CAIN, WE'LL SEE YOU THIS WEEKEND. THANK YOU.  Bill: ANOTHER AWARDS SHOW AND BIG NIGHT FOR   TAYLOR SWIFT. CHECK IT OUT. SHE WON SIX AMERICAN MUSIC AWARDS AND TWO FREE TICKETS TO HER NEXT CONCERT, KIDDING. HER FIRST PUBLIC APPEARANCE SINCE LAST WEEK'S DRAMA OVER TICKET SALES AND THE NEWS, HOWEVER, IS NOT SO GOOD FOR TICKETMASTER.

WE WIL TAMMY: FOR YEARS DEMOCRATS A PERSON NARRATIVE REPUBLICANS WILL TAKE AWAY SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE BENEFITS AND TO NO SURPRISE THE DEMOCRATS AND THEIR LAPDOGS ECHOED THOSE TALKING POINTS BUT IF REPUBLICANS WANT TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF THIS ISSUE THEY NEED TO COME UP WITH A CONCRETE PLAN TO SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS THIS IMPACTS THE MAJOR BLOCK OF THEIR VOTERS AND THOSE AMERICANS NEED THE PROMISE THAT SOCIAL SECURITY FOR ALL WILL BE SAFE IF THEY WANT TO WIN IN THE FUTURE IS ASSOCIATION MATURE AMERICANS CITIZENS SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR ACTION FULL DISCLOSURE I AM A COLUMNIST WITH YOUR GREAT ORGANIZATION AND I AM BECAUSE OF THE GREAT WORK THAT YOU DO. HEARING ABOUT THE OBAMA CARE DEBACLE AND LOOKING AT THE CONSERVATIVE ALTERNATIVE THE FOCUS IS ON SENIORS BUT WE HEARD OF RON JOHNSON WHO IS A SENATOR WHO IS REPUBLICAN AND WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE DOING IS TURNED EVERYTHING INTO DISCRETIONARY SPENDING SO TO FIX PROBLEMS THAT ARE BROKEN. IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THAT SOCIAL SECURITY IT'S NEVER THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT BUT WHAT AMERICANS HAVE PAID INTO AND DESERVE AND IS OWED TO THEM NOT JUST AT OVER 60 BUT UNDER 60 AS WELL.  WE HAVE A SERIOUS PROBLEM THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND IS HEADED FOR INSOLVENCY AND THIS WILL TAKE PLACE IN TEN YEARS OR LESS. WHEN THAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PRINCIPLE IS EXHAUSTED YOU'LL SEE A 2025 PERCENT REDUCTION ACROSS THE BOARD OF BENEFITS FROM PEOPLE DRAWING BENEFITS. THERE IS NO LAW OR POLICY RIGHT NOW THAT PREVENTS US FROM HAPPENING.  AMERICANS ARE WATCHING THIS BILLIONS GOING TO UKRAINE AND TRILLIONS SPENT FOR COVID IS THERE A BETTER WAY TO HANDLE THIS? WHY IS ELIMINATING SOCIAL SECURITY THERE GO TO?  THEY ARE IGNORING THE PROMISE TO THOSE WHO HAVE PAID INTO THIS. I STARTED WORKING AT 14 YEARS OLD I HAVE PAID IN QUITE A LONG TIME I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY KEEP LOOKING AT SOCIAL SECURITY AS AN EASY TARGET IT WILL UPSET A GREAT NUMBER OF AMERICANS.  WHAT IS THE PLAN OR THE ACTION QUICK.  WE ARE PRESENTING SOCIAL SECURITY GUARANTEE AND CAPITOL HILL WE ARE ALSO WARNING CONGRESS OF THE IMPENDING BUDGET THE PLAN IS VERY SIMPLE THE THREE COMPONENTS IT GUARANTEES AN INCREASE OF BENEFITS FROM BENEFICIARIES IT SOLVES THE INSOLVENCY OF THE TRUST FUND AND INCLUDES A SAVINGS COMPONENT TO ALLOW ALL WAGE EARNERS TO SAVE MORE MONEY FOR RETIREMENT.

ONE OF THE REASONS, ONE OF THE RAMIFICATIONS FOR THIS OUTCOME IN TERMS OF HAVING THE HOUSE AND NOT HAVING THE SENATE IS RATHER THAN HAVE A LEGISLATIVE AGENDA OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES THAT YOU COULD TRY AND PUT IN FRONT OF JOE BIDEN, CONFRONT HIM AT THE WHITE HOUSE, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE ALL OF THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS INVESTED VERY HEAVILY IN THIS TYPE OF OVERSIGHT ACTIVITY. I THINK IT'S FINE FOR HEM TO TALK ABOUT THIS, BUT ONE OF THE LESSONS THAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THIS ELECTION WAS THAT THERE WAS TOO LITTLE FOCUS ON THE AGENDA SIDE OF THINGS IN TERMS OF SOLVING THE PROBLEMS THE THAT AMERICANS ACTUALLY PRIORITIZE, THE KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES, WHICH DO NOT INCLUDE HUNTER BIDEN. YES, THEY CAN DO THIS, BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS -- AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO, BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND AS A PARTY IS GETTING TOO INVESTED INTO THAT AS THE ONLY THING THAT PEOPLE IDENTIFY WITH PUTS YOU AT MANY OF A DISTANCE -- AT MORE OF A DISTANCE FROM INDEPENDENT VOTERS. HOWARD: THE HOUSE DID THE SAME THING TO TRUMP, AND THAT'S POLITICS. IS IT LIKELY THE PRESS WILL PORTRAY NOT JUST GOING AFTER HUNTER BIDEN, BUT ALL THE OTHER POLITICAL HEARINGS THAT WILL BE HELD AS OVERREACH IN.  OH, ABSOLUTELY. AND JUST STOP IS. BEN AND I AGREE ON THIS BECAUSE AFTER THE ELECTION WHAT WE SAW IS PEOPLE SAYING WE DON'T WANT CONSPIRACY THEORIES, WE DON'T WANT INVESTIGATION AFTER INVESTIGATION, WE WANT YOU TO FOCUS ON KITCHEN TABLE A ISSUES, WHICH ABORTION IS ONE FOR THEM, FOR VOTERS THAT WE FOUND MT. MIDTERMS. AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE BASICALLY SAYING, OKAY, WE WON JUST THE HOUSE BY A VERY SLIM MAJORITY, SAME SLIM MAJORITY DEMOCRATS HAD, LET'S GO AFTER HUNTER BIDEN. THIS IS NOT GOING TO WORK FOR HEM AND, HONESTLY, THIS IS NOT MT. BEST INTEREST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE REASON SO MANY AMERICANS WILL SUPPORT OR APPLAUD DIVIDED GOVERNMENT IS BECAUSE THEY KEEP HOPING THAT SANTA CLAUS IS REAL AND DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS CAN WORK TOGETHER TO GET THINGS DONE. WE'VE SEEN IT WITH INFRASTRUCTURE AND OTHER THINGS, IN FORMER ADMINISTRATIONS, IT CAN BE DONE AGAIN BUT NOT WHEN YOU'RE SPENDING TIME WITH HUNTER BIDEN. AND I'M HEARING HAY WANT TO BRING BENGHAZI BACK FOR AN 18TH DECISION THAT HILLARY CLINTON DID NOTHING WRONG. HOWARD: WELL, IF HOUSE REPUBLICANS, PRESUMABLY LED BY KEVIN McCARTHY, CAN'T COUNT ON ANYTHING FROM THE DEMOCRATS WHICH MAY BE HARD GIVEN THEIR STRONG RIGHT WING, WON'T THERE BE MEDIA CRITICISM THAT THEY COULDN'T DELIVER?  I THINK THERE'LL BE SOME MEDIA CRITICISM IF THEY END UP NOT DOING ANYTHING WHEN IT COMES TO THE AGENDA ITEMS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAIR VOTERS, IN TERMS OF BORDER, CRIMINAL JUSTICE, TRYING THE MAKE SURE WE CAN GET THIS ECONOMY WORKING AGAIN. I THINK ALL OF THOSE ARE THINGS THEY CAN DO. LOOK, YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO WALK AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME, AND I THINK IN CASE IT WOULD BE A SLAP IN THE FACE TO A LOT OF THEIR OWN SUPPORTERS IF THEY DID NOT GO AFTER A NUMBER OF THESE VERY LEGITIMATE ISSUES, I BELIEVE, HAVE BEEN RAISED, QUESTIONS AROUND HUNTER BIDEN'S FUNDING, ABOUT THE SOURCES OF MONEY, THE POTENTIAL OVERLAP WITH THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF. THOSE ARE ALL LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK THEY SHOULD INVESTIGATE BUT, FRANKLY, I CARE A LOT MORE GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF A LOT OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO COVID THAT A WE NEVER GOT FULL ANSWERS FROM, THIS ADMINISTRATION AND ON THE FOREIGN SIDE OF THINGS. I CARE A LOT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, INVESTIGATING AND GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT. AND THAT'S ACTUALLY AN ISSUE THAT I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE AS MORE OF A DIRECT IMPACT ON THEIR DAY-TO-DAY LIFE THAN ANYTHING THAT WAS DISCOVERING HUNTER BIDEN'S -- DISCOVERING HUNTER BIDEN'S POTENTIAL CORRUPTION. HOWARD: THIS IS GOING TO BE A SEA CHANGE. LESLIE, WHEN THE MEDIA HAD STORIES ABOUT HOW THE DEMOCRATS HAD SUCH A GREAT MIDTERM ELECTION, I REMEMBER THINKING IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE REPUBLICANS WIN BY ONE VOTE, IT BLOCKS THE BIDEN AGENDA.  TRUE. NOT MESSILY THOUGH. THERE ARE AREAS -- NECESSARILY THOUGH. THERE ARE AREAS WHERE THERE CAN BE BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT, AND IMMIGRATION IS ONE. LOOK, IF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS GET TOGETHER AND PASS LEGISLATION TO CHANGE OUR CURRENT ASYLUM LAWS, WE WOULDN'T HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE STANDING AT OUR BORDER BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO. THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE. TWO, YOU KNOW, IT DEPENDS ON WHAT DISTRICT YOU'RE FROM AND HOW CONSERVATIVE OR MODERATE YOU ARE AS A REPUBLICAN. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN A DOZEN REPUBLICANS VOTE WITH DEMOCRATS ON THE LATEST PIECE OF LEGISLATION PASSED. HOWARD: OKAY.  AND, LEE THE, IT JUST AFTER, YOU KNOW, CLAIMING YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A RED WAVE, A MANDATE AND ALL PURE, IT MAKES YOU -- POWER, IT MAKES YOU LOOK FOOLISH. HOWARD: UP NEXT, WILL DONALD TRUMP RETURN TO TWITTER NOW THAT ELON MUSK TAKING THAT POLL HAS REINSTATED HIM? \u266a \u266a 20221120162256.073|20221120162601.257",

        "trs": "  WELCOME BACK. YOU'RE TAKING A LIVE LOOK AT SOME PICTURES FROM SMYRNA, GEORGIA. THAT'S REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR THE U.S. SENATE HERSHEL WALKER. HE'S HOLDING A RALLY THERE WITH GEORGIA GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP AS PART OF THE EVICT WARNOCK BUS TOUR. EVERYBODY MAKING THOSE PUSHES ON THE CAMPAIGN AS THE RUNOFF IN GEORGIA WILL BE HELD ON DECEMBER 6TH. ALL RIGHT, NOW TO LAS VEGAS WHERE SOME 2024 PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS ARE BETTING THAT BEING IN THE SPOTLIGHT AT A REPUBLICAN JEWISH COALITION LEADERSHIP MEETING MAY HELP THEM GAIN SOME ATTENTION. ALEXANDRIA HUFF IS THERE WITH A PACKED LINEUP OF SPEAKERS.  HI, GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. IT'S INDEED PACKED AND THE ONLY DECLARED CANDIDATE IS FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO IS SPEAKING THIS AFTERNOON. HE'S THE ONLY DECLARED CANDIDATE SHALL THAT IS OF ALL THOSE WHO ARE HERE, BUT HE WILL FOLLOW SEVERAL SPEAKERS LAST NIGHT, POTENTIAL PRIMARY CHALLENGERS OF HIS WHO SPOKE ON THE STAGE SAYING THAT THE PARTY NEEDS SOMEBODY NEW.  THIS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS, BUT WE NEED NOT BE ANGRY, WE NEED NOT BE MEAN. WE NEED NOT CALL NAMES. WE NEED TO MAKE THE CASE AND WIN THE ARGUMENT.  LOOK, THIS IS THE THIRD ELECTION IN A ROW THAT WE LOST AND SHOULD HAVE WON. I SAY THREE STRIKES AND YOU'RE O OUT.  SO THIS CRITICISM WAS LOBBED FOLLOWING THE DEFEAT OF HIGH PROFILE TRUMP-BACKED CANDIDATES LAST WEEK AND MARYLAND GOVERNOR LARRY HOGAN AND SECRETARY OF STATE MIKE POMPEO FEEL THEY KNOW LONGER LIKE AND SHOTS AT FORMER VICE-PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE, BUT THEY WERE DIRECT.  I TRULY BELIEVE TO WIN THE FUTURE THAT WE AS OUR REPUBLICAN LEADERS AND ELECTORS MUST DO MORE THAN CRITICIZE AND COM COMPLAIN.  SO WE'RE EXPECTING TO HEAR MORE OF THE SAME TODAY THROUGHOUT THE EVENING AND DURING THE SECOND DAY OF THE REPUBLICAN JEWISH COALITION'S ANNUAL MEETING AND GOVERNOR CHRIS SUNUNU WILL SPEAK ALONG WITH TIM SCOTT, NIKKI HALEY AND GOVERNOR DESANTIS WHO WILL ADDRESS THE CROWD AND INCOMING ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU. THIS IS AN INFLUENTIAL ROOM LIKELY SEEN AS THE FIRST CATTLE CALL OF THE 2024 ELECTION CYCLE. JACQUI: THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE'RE NOT SURE IF OR WHEN THE POTENTIAL 2024 CONTENDERS WILL JUMP IN. WE DO KNOW THAT 76-YEAR-OLD DONALD TRUMP IS IN AND SOON TO BE 80-YEAR-OLD JOE BIDEN INDICATED HE'LL RUN AGAIN. WITH A LOT MORE YOUNGER VOTERS TURNING OUT IN 2022, WILL IT BE HARDER FOR THEM IN 2024? JOINING ME LEE CARTER AND DOUG SHONE. GOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH. I DON'T WANT TO BE ACCUSED OF BEING AGEIST HERE, BUT THIS IS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION. JOE BIDEN AT 80 AND PRESIDENT TRUMP AT 76 CURRENTLY, ONLY GOING TO BE A LITTLE OLDER WHEN 2024 ROLLS AROUND AND WE DID SEE A LOT OF YOUNG VOTERS TURN OUT AND THERE IS SOME QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER, BOTH PARTIES NEED JUST A LITTLE BIT OF FRESH AIR AND BLOOD AND LIFE BREATHED INTO EVERYTHING?  YEAH, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. IT'S AN ISSUE FOR VOTERS AND IT'S ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. SO 86% OF AMERICANS SAY THAT THE CUT-OFF FOR THE AGE OF RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT SHOULD BE 75, AND LOOKING AT BIDEN AND TRUMP, 68% OF AMERICANS THINK THAT JOE BIDEN WOULDN'T BE UP FOR THE JOB AND OTHERS FOR TRUMP. EN 0 THE REPUBLICAN SIDE SOME OF THE YOUNGER CANDIDATES IN PARTICULAR, WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN FLORIDA WITH RAN DESANTIS, AN INCREDIBLE VICTORY FOR HIM LOTS AND LOTS OF ENTHUSIASM AND I THINK THERE WILL BE ROOM AS WELL. THE QUESTION IS WHO IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO FILL THE SHOES, IT'S NOT AS CLEAR OF THE EMERGING LEADERS ON THE LEFT AS ON THE RIGHT. JACQUI: DOUG, I'LL COME TO YOU ON THIS. BECAUSE NANCY PELOSI RESIGNING, SHE MADE THIS COMMENTARY HERSELF SAYING IT WAS TIME TO PASS THE BATON OVER, AND GRANTED SHE'S HELD ON FOR 20 YEARS. THE NEW LEADERSHIP COMING UP IN THE HOUSE ISN'T NECESSARILY SO CLEAR ON THE DEMOCRAT'S SIDE.  YEAH, I THINK IF SOMEONE LIKE HAKEEM JEFFERSON EMERGES AS THE LIKELY MINORITY LEADER, A PERSON OF COLOR, HIGHLY QUALIFIED FROM NEW YORK, I THINK THAT HE WOULD OFFER THE PROSPECT AS A YOUNGER MAN OF FRESH IDEAS AND FRESH SERVICE. I THINK THE OTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE IS THE ISSUE DYNAMIC OF 2022, PARTICULARLY FOR DEMOCRATS ON ISSUES LIKE ABORTION WERE TO STIMULATE YOUNGER VOTERS TO TURN OUT. LEE IS UNDENIABLY CORRECT THAT BOTH PARTIES WOULD BENEFIT BY NEW AND YOUNGER LEADERSHIP, FRESH IDEAS. SHE'S ALSO RIGHT THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A DEEPER BENCH THAN DEMOCRATS. DEMOCRATS DO HAVE THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT WHO AT THIS POINT HAS MADE IT CLEAR HE IS IN FACT RUNNING FOR REELECTION AND IF HE DOES, HE WILL GET THE NOMINATION. JACQUI: AND LEE, BACK TO YOU ON THIS, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY SINCE THE LAST TIME I BELIEVE I SPOKE TO YOU ON THE AIR, DONALD TRUMP HAS NOW ANNOUNCED HE'LL BE RUNNING IN 2024, AND IT FEELS LIKE THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD CLEAR THE FIELD IN SOME WAY OR POSSIBLY, YOU KNOW, GIVE THE MESSAGE TO CERTAIN PEOPLE MAYBE IT'S KNOW THE TIME TO RUN. WHAT DO YOU THINK? HOW DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW ARE TAKING THAT ANNOUNCEMENT? DO YOU THINK THAT IT WILL BE, YOU KNOW, CROWDED STAGE? OR NOT SO CROWDED.  I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY CROWDED STAGE. I THINK THE REACTION TO DONALD TRUMP'S ANNOUNCEMENT ISN'T AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS MAYBE EVEN HE EXPECTED. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING NUMBERS, A LOT OF PEOPLE AREN'T AS ENTHUSIASTIC AS THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN. THIS IS A LONG WAY OUT. WE'RE STILL IN 2022, 2024 IS A LONG WAY AWAY. IN 2015 WE WERE EXPECTING IT TO BE JEB BUSH AS REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, SO I THINK THERE'S REALLY NO WAY OF KNOWING, BUT I EXPECT THE DEEP-- THE BENCH TO BE DEEP. YOU CAN SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE. MIKE PENCE IS CLEARLY PUTTING HIMSELF FRONT AND CENTER AND THERE'S OTHERS LIKE NIKKI HALEY, CERTAINLY GOVERNOR DESANTIS IS GOING TO PUT HIMSELF OUT THERE. I EXPECT THEM TO BE AT LEAST A DOZEN DOING EXPLORATORY WORK RIGHT NOW. JACQUI: AND OF COURSE, DESANTIS HAD THE HUGE WIN IN FLORIDA AND MANY PEOPLE SAY THIS IS HIS TIME, BUT WE'LL SEE. THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH FOR COMING ON, LEE AND DOUG, ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU.  GOOD TO SEE YOU. JACQUI: AHEAD, WELL OVER 100 HOSPITALS IN 21 STATES GETTING HIT BY A CYBER ATTACK PUTTING PATIENT'S PRIVACY AND LIVES IN DANGER. WHAT DOES IT KEEP HAPPENING? NORTH KOREA FIRING OFF ANOTHER MISSILE TEST. WHILE THAT'S NOT NEW, OFFICIALS WARNING THIS ONE COULD POTENTIALLY HIT THE U.S. THAT'S NEXT. 20221119163158.082|20221119163533.930",

        "trs": "JACKIE: ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND NAMING SPECIAL COUNSEL TO OVERSEE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S INVESTIGATION INTO SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS RECOVERED AT MAR-A-LAGO AND THE JANUARY 6TH RIOT AND COMES JUST DAY AFTER FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCES THIRD RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. WHERE IS THIS ALL HEADED, LET'S GET STRAIGHT TO FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL TOM DUPREE, TOM, GREAT TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING AND BEING ABLE TO DIG INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE TIMING OF THIS AND THE AMERICAN WHO IS ARE WATCHING THINKING THE EXPLANATION IS THAT AN INDEPENDENT COUNSEL IS SUPPOSED TO SOMEHOW MAKE THIS A LITTLE BIT IMPARTIAL BUT THEY STILL FEEL IT MAY BE SLIGHTLY POLITICALLY MOTIVATED?  YEAH, JACKIE, I THINK AMERICA'S REACTION THIS MORNING IS HERE WE GO AGAIN, YOU KNOW, ANOTHER SPECIAL COUNSEL INVESTIGATION OPENS ITS DOORS AND, LOOK, THE TIMING ON THIS DID SURPRISE ME A LITTLE BIT. PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCED CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT JUST 72 HOURS AGO ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND IMMEDIATELY, YOU KNOW, 3 DAYS LATER MERRICK GARLAND APPOINTS A SPECIALS COUNSEL. IT'S SOMETHING THAT HE COULD HAVE DONE MONTHS AND MONTHS AGO WHEN THE INVESTIGATIONS BEGAN OR SOMETHING THAT HE COULD HAVE LET A LITTLE TIME PASS RATHER THAN DO SOMETHING AT A TIME WHERE SEEMS CONNECT TODAY PRESIDENT TRUMP'S CANDIDACY ANNOUNCEMENT. JACKIE: YOU BRING UP A GREAT POINT. COULD BE SEEN AS SURPRISING OR NOT SURPRISING. HAVING SAID THAT, TOM, TWO ASPECTS TO THIS OBVIOUSLY. THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN TO MAR-A-LAGO DYE PRESIDENT TRUMP BUT ALSO THEY'RE LOOKING INTO HIS EFFORTS TO POTENTIALLY OBSTRUCT THE TRANSFER OF POWER IN 2020. ALL THAT SAID, HOW DOES THIS IMPACT HIS RUN IN 2024?  WELL, IT'S OBVIOUS IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING HE HAS TO DEAL WITH. WE WILL SEE HOW QUICKLY THESE INVESTIGATIONS MOVE FORWARD. YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THERE ARE NOW TWO SEPARATE INVESTIGATIONS THAT HAVE BASICALLY BEEN CONSOLIDATED BEFORE A SINGLE SPECIAL COUNSEL. MIMY SENSE IS THAT THE MAR-A-LAGO INVESTIGATION WILL PROBABLY MOVE A LOT FASTER. I THINK THERE THERE'S A LIMITED WITNESSES AND THE JANUARY 6TH EVENTS IS SOMETHING THAT'S MUCH MORE SPRAWLING, MUCH MORE HARDER TO GET YOUR HEAD AROUND THE FACTS OR CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION. IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME THAT THE MAR-A-LAGO PART MOVED QUICKLY AND THE JANUARY 6TH QUICKLY PART OF THIS MOVED SLOWLY. JACKIE: JACK SMITH IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATION REPORTS TO MERRICK GARLAND. MERRICK GARLAND IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE INVOLVED IN IT ALTHOUGH HE HAS AUTHORITY TO REMOVE JACK SMITH. HAVING SAID THAT HE HAS A PRETTY GOOD REPUTATION. YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE CHOICE --  SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE CHOICE. I MEAN, THIS IS A GUY WHO IS PROSECUTED BEFORE. HE'S FAMILIAR WITH NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES, YOU KNOW, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, HE'S A STRAIGHT SHOOTER. AT THE SAME TIME IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND AS YOU NOTED THAT MERRICK GARLAND ISN'T COMPLETELY DISENGAGED FROM THIS, TO THE CONTRARY TO THE FACT THAT HE WILL KEEP ONE HAND ON THE TILLER AND ULTIMATELY HIS DECISION, MERRICK GARLAND'S DECISION WHETHER OR NOT THEY INDICT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL GIVES YOU SOME INDEPENDENCE BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE MERRICK GARLAND IS STILL STEERING THE SHIP. JACKIE: GOT IT. TOM DUPREE, THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THANK YOU, JACKIE. JACKIE: REPUBLICANS WINNING NARROW MAJORITY THIS WEEKEND, MEANWHILE HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI ANNOUNCING SHE WILL NOT SEEK REELECTION FOR LEADERSHIP POSITION SO WHAT IS ALL OF THIS GOING TO MEAN FOR THE WORK THAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO GET DONE FOR US, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. JOINING ME WASHINGTON EXAMINER, TIANNA LOWE, ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU. LET'S START WITH REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP OF THE HOUSE. OBVIOUSLY I COVERED BUSINESS AND WALL STREET AND WALL STREET SAW THE HANDWRITING ON THE WALL AND WAS HAPPY ABOUT IT BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY EVEN IF LEGISLATION CAN'T NECESSARILY BE PASSED BY REPUBLICANS, THEY CAN BLOCK LEGISLATION, THEY CAN BLOCK FURTHER SPENDING AND THAT RIGHT NOW IS VIEWED AT LEAST BY THE MARKETS IN WALL STREET AS A GOOD THING.  YES, THE MARKETS DEFINITELY LIKE THAT GRIDLOCK AND IT MAKES SENSE, RIGHT, BECAUSE WE HAD A PRESIDENT THAT ENTERED OFFICE WITH MANDATE TO GOVERN AND HE STILL PUSHED THROUGH $1.9 TRILLION AND WE SAW THE INFLATIONARY CYCLE SPIN OUT. WE GOT GOOD NEWS ON THE INFLATION FRONT WITH NOD RATING EVER SO SLIGHTLY THE CORE CPI COMING DOWN AND NOW YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS BACK IN THE HELM EVER SO SLIGHTLY. WHAT THAT MEANS WE WILL GET A SLOWDOWN IN SPENDING, WE ARE GOING TO GET A SLOWDOWN IN BIDEN BEING ABLE TO PASS STUFF AND GET STUFF DONE AND WE KNOW THAT MARKETS RESPOND WELL TO THAT. WAS THIS A GREAT WIN FOR REPUBLICANS, CLEARLY NOT IN THE LAST 100 YEARS OF THOSE 25 MIDTERM ELECTIONS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN HELD THE PARTY IN POWER HAS ONLY EVER GAINED HOUSE SEATS 3 TIMES IN THOSE LAST 25 ELECTIONS.  SO THE FACT THE REPUBLICANS MANAGED TO GET, YOU KNOW, A VERY SLIM MAJORITY NOT A HUGE FEET BUT IT DOES SORT OF PUT THE BRAKE DOWN ON BIDEN'S SPENDING WHICH WE KNOW IS GOOD. JACKIE: AND THE BREAKDOWN WILL BE CRUCIAL FOR KEVIN MCCARTHY WHEN WE SEE THE, YOU KNOW, OFFICIAL ELECTION OF WHO WILL BE THE SPEAKER. BUT HAVING SAID THAT, WE ALSO HAVE THE NEWS THAT NANCY PELOSI IS MOVING AWAY FROM HER LEADERSHIP ROLE AND I'M JUST WOWONDERING GIVEN HOW SPLIT THE COUNTRY IS, DO YOU THINK IT'S TIME FOR NEW LEADERSHIP ON BOTH SIDES?  OH, CERTAINLY. THE DIFFICULTY IS WHO IS IN THE BACK BENCH, RIGHT. ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE HAKEEM JEFFRESS, HE'S TRAINED, HE'S NANCY PELOSI TRAINED SUCCESSOR BUT HE ENGAGED IN DENIALISM OF HIS OWN WHEN TRUMP WON. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BODE WELL WHEN THE STATE OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS THE CAMPAIGN LINE FOR DEMOCRATS AND WE SAW CLEARLY THAT WORKED BETTER THAN OTHERS AND I THINK MYSELF EXPECTED. ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE OF THE AISLE WHO CAN REALLY REPLACE MITCH MCCONNELL WHO IS NOT A VISIONARY IN TERMS OF GOVERNING THE SENATE WHILE REPUBLICANS HAVE POWER HE IS GREAT AT STOPPING DEMOCRATS WHEN REPUBLICANS ARE OUT OF POWER. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PUSHING, JOE BIDEN TURNS 80 THIS WEEKEND. DONALD TRUMP WILL BE 78 ON ELECTION DAY IF HE DOES ACTUALLY SEE THIS THROUGH. I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS QUESTIONING THE FACT THAT OUR LEADERSHIP IS TOO OLD AND WE DO NEED NEW IDEAS. BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO, WHO CAN TAKE THAT OVER. WE SAW RICK SCOTT TRY AND CHALLENGE MITCH MCCONNELL BUT WE SAW HOW WELL RNC DID IN THE ELECTION. THEY WERE BANKRUPT BY AUGUST AND HE NEEDED MITCH MCCONNELL TO BAIL HIM OUT. JACKIE: HISTORY HAS SHOWN IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THINGS DONE WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IS DIVIDED. WE SAW PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON WORK WITH REPUBLICAN SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH. DO YOU THINK THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN AND MCCARTHY CAN COME TOGETHER AND FIND A WAY TO GET THINGS DONE?  I MEAN, HOPEFULLY I THINK THAT THAT'S A BIT AMBITIOUS, RIGHT, AND IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOW TWITTER THESE DAYS AND UNLIKE THE CLINTON DAIS. I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT -- NOT FROM A MARKET PERSPECTIVE BUT PROBABLY GOING TO PASS, RIGHT, AND THAT'S A LANDMARK PIECE OF LEGISLATION WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO WHERE THE BALL WAS ON MARRIAGE EQUALITY. THAT BEING SAID, YOU KNOW, WITH THE COLLAPSE OF FTX, I THINK THAT THERE WILL BE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR A LITTLE EXTRA REGULATION OF THE CRYPTO MARKET NEEDED OR NOT BUT REALLY IT ALL COMES DOWN TO SPENDING AND INFLATION. JACKIE: SPENDING AND INFLATION. TIANA, THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING. INFLATION, EASING LITTLE THIS MONTH PRESIDENT BIDEN IS CHEERING IT BUT ARE YOU FEELING IT AS YOU HEAD INTO THANKSGIVING AND THE WORLD'S CUP ABOUT TO GET UNDERWAY BUT IN AND OUT WITHOUT CONTREVY AND WHY BEER LOVING FANS ARE TICKED OFF? JACKIE: AMERICANS FACING STICKER SHOCK AS THEY HIT THE STORES FOR THEIR THANKSGIVING DINNER AND THEY'RE CRANKING UP THE HEAT WITH TEMPERATURES GETTING COLDER. PRESIDENT BIDEN STILL SAYING HIS POLICIES ARE HELPING BUT ARE AMERICANS FEELING IT? LUCAS TOMLINSON AT THE WHITE HOUSE FOR US. HI, LUCAS. LUCAS: HI, JACKIE, GOOD MORNING, 30 MINUTES AWAY FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN'S GRANDDAUGHTER BEING MARRIED HERE AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN HIS FIRST PUBLIC REMARK FROM RETURNING IN OVERSEAS TRIP. PRESIDENT BIDEN TRY TODAY REASSURE THE PUBLIC THAT THE ECONOMY IS GETTING STRONGER.  AND OUR APPROACH IS WORKING. IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO GET INFLATION BACK TO NORMAL LEVERAGES AS WE KEEP JOB MARKET STRONG SO WE CAN SEE SETBACKS ALONG THE WAY, I DON'T DOUBT THAT BUT SO FAR WE ARE IN GOOD SHAPE BUT WE ARE LASER FOCUS ON THAT. LUCAS: REMARKS TO VIRTUAL AUDIENCE AND CEO OF FORD PROBABLY TALKING ABOUT ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE AUTOMATED WORKERS, JACKIE. THIS CHART DID NOT MAKE IT IN THE PRESIDENT'S PRESENTATION, INFLATION BEING 1.4% WHEN BIDEN WAS SWORN INTO OFFICE, IT'S BEEN OVER 7.5 ALL YEAR REMAINING AT NEARLY 40-YEAR HIGHS, BIDEN SAYS GAS PRICES REMAIN HIGH BUT 50% HIGHER THAN SWORN TO OFFICE AND RETIREMENT SAVINGS HAVE PLUMMETED 23%, HEATING BILLS ARE EXPECTED TO BE 25% COMPARED TO LAST WINTER, REPUBLICAN LEADERS REMAIN OUTRAGE.  75% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE WE ARE ON THE WRONG TRACK. ECONOMICALLY THEY'VE WATCHED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, WHEN YOU SERVED IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WE WATCHED WHAT PROSPERITY COULD DO TO THE NATION AND IT DIDN'T FOCUS ONE ON PART OF THE COUNTRY, IT LIFTED EVERYBODY UP.  WE DON'T HAVE TO REMIND OUR VIEWERS ANT INFLATION, THEY FEEL IT EVERY DAY WHEN THEY GO TO THE GROCERY STORE AND THEY BUY INGREDIENTS FOR THANKSGIVING DINNER. IT'S EXPECTED TO COST 20% MORE THIS YEAR COMPARED TO LAST YEAR, JACKIE. JACKIE: CPI HAS COME DOWN BUT THE FOOD PRICES REMAIN ELEVATED AND PEOPLE DO FEEL IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. OF COURSE, NOT JUST THE FOOD COSTS THAT ARE CLIMBING, HOMEOWNERS ARE GETTING SLAMMED WITH HOME HEATING BILLS. TEMPERATURES DROP AGO CROSS THE COUNTRY. MADISON ALWORTH AT HOW BAD IT COULD GET THIS WINTER, MADISON.  WE ARE RIDING AROUND WITH OIL FOR LESS AND SAY CUSTOMERS ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH THE SKYROCKETING COSTS.  HEATING COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGH THIS WINTER. HEATING OIL UP 68% YEAR OVER YEAR. TODAY THEY FILLED UP THIS TANK WITH $950 WORTH OF HOME HEATING OIL. A YEAR AGO THE SAME AMOUNT OF OIL WOULD HAVE COST THEM CLOSER TO $60 AND THAT'S WHY THE COMPANY TELLS ME SOME CUSTOMERS ARE DOING WITHOUT.  PEOPLE ARE GOING WITHOUT HOT WATER AND HEAT FOR A WEEK BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T HAD THE MONEY TO CALL ME AND SAY COME ON IN IN.  80% OF THE HOME HEATING OIL IS CONSUMED, THIS IS THE FIRST REALLY COLD WEEK AND PEOPLE WHO WERE HOPING THAT PRICES WOULD COME DOWN AND NEED TO FILL UP NOW ARE PAYING A DOLLAR MORE THAN THEY WOULD HAVE A MONTH AGO ACCORDING TO THE ENERGY INFORMATION ASSOCIATION. JACKIE: MADISON ALWORTH, THANK YOU. PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYS THAT ECONOMIC POLICIES ARE HELPING TO EASE INFLATIONS SO ARE AMERICANS FEELING THAT RELIEF OR ARE THEY STILL FEELING THE PINCH. TO KING'S VIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT CIO SCOTT MARTIN AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST LAURA FINK. LAURA, I WANT TO START WITH YOU BECAUSE CPI HAS COME DOWN AND IT'S OFF THE PEAK BUT STILL AT 40-YEAR HIGHS AND AMERICANS ARE STRUGGLING AND THEY SAID AS THEY EXITED THE POLLS THAT FOOD COSTS ARE ONE OF THE TOP -- TOP ISSUES RIGHT NOW AND THIS IS ALL GOING ON A LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN EVERYBODY EXPECTED. YOU HAD A FED AND AN ADMINISTRATION THAT SAID IT WAS TRANSITORY. IT HASN'T BEEN TRANSITORY. THEY ARE SAYING WE WILL SEE SOME RELIEF, WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN THE RELIEF YET AND THE PRESIDENT SAYS THAT EVERYTHING IS FINE. I MEAN, IS HE BEING A LITTLE TONE DEAF HERE?  I THINK HE EXPRESSED EMPATHY IN OTHER PARTS OF THAT SIDE OF REMARKS THAT JUST DIDN'T GET CLIPPED BUT I DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF EMPATHY BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE ECONOMY IS KIND OF WORKING OUT. YOU ARE NOT GOING TO SEE RESULTS RIGHT AWAY. WE ARE SEEING INDICATORS THAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING WHERE INFLATION IS COMING DOWN, GAS PRICES ARE COMING DOWN. WE ARE SEEING THAT WE ARE PERFORMING WELL ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT THAT THIS IS A GLOBAL CRISIS. YOU ARE NOT SEEING INFLATION NUMBERS LOOKING GREAT IN JUST ABOUT ANY OTHER COUNTRY. SO PRESIDENT BIDEN REALIZES THAT THIS IS IMPROVING AND IT IS HELPING AND CONSUMERS KNOW THAT. 40% OF CONSUMERS, OF VOTERS THAT LOOKED AT JOE BIDEN AND SAID YOU KNOW I MAY NOT BE SATISFIED WITH HIM BUT I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR HIM OR VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS ANYWAY. THAT'S A SIGN THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ECONOMY MAY NOT BE SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE HAPPY WITH NOW BUT THEY -- THEY TRUST THAT IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER. SO I SEE THAT ACROSS -- ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND I THINK YOU SEE THAT WITH THE FED'S NUMBERS, I THINK YOU SEE THAT WITH THE IMPROVING NUMBERS, THE JOBS NUMBERS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN MENTION AND THE GOLDILOCKSES ECONOMY IS ON TRACK BUT IT IS HARD --  GOLDILOCKSES. JACKIE: SCOTT, I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU TAKE A LITTLE STAB. PEOPLE WERE PUTTING OTHER ISSUES LIKE ABORTION AHEAD OF THE ECONOMY EVEN THOUGH THEY SAID THAT THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE STRUGGLING IN IT RIGHT NOW AND HAVING SAID THAT WE DO KNOW THAT THE FED WILL HAVE TO KEEP RAISING INTEREST RATES TO COOL DOWN THE ECONOMY AND THE JOBS NUMBERS DON'T SHOW IT YET, SCOTT, I IMAGINE AT CERTAIN POINT THERE WILL BE A TIPPING POINT HEARING FROM COMPANIES AND META AND THAT'S ARE LAYING PEOPLE OFF IN DROVES AND JAROME POWELL TOLD US AMERICAN WILLS HAVE TO LOSE THEIR JOB HERE.  I THINK WE INSULTED GOLDILOCKSES OR AT LEAST LAURA DID BUT THIS SEEMS LIKE ANYTHING LIKE A GOLDILOCKSES ECONOMY. WE ARE BARELY GROWING, WE HAVE INFLATION OUT OF CONTROL. JOBS ARE STILL STRONG BUT IT'S STARTING TO TAIL OFF. DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. GOING FORWARD ALSO TOO WITH RESPECT TO THE FED, THEY HAVE MORE RATE HIKES BEHIND THEM AND THEY NEED TO TAKE THE BRAKE AND THAT SHOULD BRING INFLATION DOWN. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP GROWTH AT ALL AND THEREFORE PUT US INTO ANOTHER RECESSION. JACKIE: LAURA, I LIKE THE ANALOGY THAT YOU MAKE THAT WHEN YOU TRY TO INITIATE CHANGE IT TAKES A WHILE LIKE GOING TO THE GYM AND TRYING TO SEE RESULTS WITH YOUR WORKOUTS, BUT HAVING SAID THAT AMERICANS HAVE BEEN GOING THIS FOR WELL OVER A YEAR, APPROACHING TWO YEARS NOW AND GETTING TO THE POINT THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE HARD DECISIONS. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR SIDE SAYS IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE TIME BUT HOW MUCH MORE TIME CAN WE GIVE IT BEFORE PEOPLE REACH A BREAKING POINT?  I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR. IT'S NOT JUST MY SIDE, IT'S VAST MAJORITY OF ECONOMISTS THAT ARE LOOKING AT THIS. WHEN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU SEE WITH REPUBLICANS, MY COLLEAGUE, EVERYONE, NOT OFFERING UP AN ALTERNATIVE THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS SORT OF THE RIGHT DIRECTION THAT THIS IS INCREDIBLY TOUGH AND DURABLE PROBLEM WITH THE A GLOBAL PANDEMIC, IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO RECOVER. WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM WHILE HAVING EMPATHY FOR THE VOTERS AND WORKERS THAT ARE COMING TO THE TABLE AND TRYING TO GET THE FOOD. JACKIE: I'M NOT SURE WHICH ECONOMISTS YOU SPEAK TO. WE SPEAK TO A LOT OF ECONOMISTS, SCOTT, WE HEAR FROM A LOT OF CEO'S WHO HAVE BASICALLY SAID THAT THERE WILL BE A RECESSION IN 2023.  I'M HAPPY TO SPEAK TO THAT. JACKIE: LAST WORD, SCOTT.  THEY DON'T ADMIT THEY HAD A RECESSION THERE'S ANOTHER ONE COMING AND ALSO, LOOK, OUT OF CONTROL SPENDING WILD REGULATIONS IS NOT A WAY TO BRING DOWN INFLATION. WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF THE INFLATION COME THROUGH BASICALLY THE BOTTOM LINE AND HAVING A STANCE LIKE THAT GOING FORWARD TOO AS HE HAS THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP PRICE PRESSURES ANYWHERE LET ALONE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE STRUGGLING ALREADY. JACKIE: SCOTT, LAURA, GOOD TO SEE YOU BOTH THIS MORNING. WORLD CUP KICKING OFF TOMORROW IN QATAR BUT WILL A BAN ON BEER HAVE FANS MORE BOISTEROUS, ALEX. ALEX: WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO FANS HERE ABOUT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO GET A BEER IN THE STADIUM BUT DESPITE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITEMENT LEADING UP TO THE WORLD CUP THAT KICKS OFF TOMORROW. WE WILL HAVE MUCH MORE AFTER THE BREAK. JACKIE: WORLD CUP SET TO KICK OFF TOMORROW AFTER CONTROVERSY AND LAST-MINUTE BAN OF BEERS AT THE STADIUMS HAS SOME SPECTATORS FUMING, ALEX HOGAN HAS THE LATEST FROM DOHA, QATAR, THIS HAS CREATED QUITE THE STIR, ALEX. ALEX: IT HAS, JACKIE, AND PEOPLE ACTUALLY WILL BE ABLE TO GET ALCOHOL IN THE STADIUM BUT ONLY IF THEY'RE FORKING UP A LOT OF MONEY, IF THEY ARE STAYING IN VIP OR LUXURY SUITS, EVERYONE IN THE STADIUM WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO DRINK NONALCOHOLIC, STILL THAT WILL RUN YOU MORE THAN $8 AND IF YOU'RE WATCHING THE GAME AT ONEE OF THE FIFA FAN ZONES OR DESIGNATED HOTEL BAR WHERE DRINKING IS ALLOWED, TYPICAL BEER WILL BE COSTING YOU ON AVERAGE $14. DRINKING IN PUBLIC HERE IN QATAR IS ILLEGAL, ALTHOUGH TO HOST THE WORLD CUP THAT RULE IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIFTED SINCE THE INTERNATIONAL SOCCER TOURNAMENT SO OFTEN IS SEEN AS A MONTH-LONG PARTY. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CRITICISM ABOUT HOW THIS WAS SUCH A LAST-MINUTE CHANGE AND CRITICS SAY THAT THIS CAST A LOT OF DOUBT ON OTHER CULTURAL PROMISES MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT. NOW THE PRESIDENT OF FIFA FIRED BACK AT THE COMMENTS ARGUING THAT ANY CRITICISM IN QATAR IS HYPOCRITICAL GIVEN THAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR PASTS.  I THINK FOR WHAT WE EUROPEANS HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE LAST 3,000 YEARS AROUND THE WORLD WE SHOULD BE APOLOGIZING FOR THE NEXT 3,000 YEARS BEFORE STARTING TO GIVER MORAL LESSONS. ALEX: MUCH OF THE LEAD-UP TO WORLD CUP HAS BEEN OVERSHADOWED BY THE COUNTRY'S BAN ON SAME-SEX RELATIONSHIPS AND THE WORKING CONDITIONS FOR WORKING BUILDING FACILITIES AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE DIED BUILDING THE FACILITIES AND THE WORLD CUP KICKS OFF TOMORROW. FIRST MATCH BETWEEN QATAR AND ECUADOR, WE ARE LIVE OUTSIDE OF THE FOX SPORTS SET WHERE PEOPLE AT HOME WILL BE ABLE TO WATCH ALL OF THESE GAMES ON FOX SPORTS.

        "trs": "RACHEL: TODAY IS NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY, AND THERE ARE OVER 113,000 CHILDREN WAITING TO BE ADOPTED FROM FOSTER CARE RIGHT HERE MT. UNITED STATES. IN THE UNITED STATES. BUT SINCE THE DOBBS DECISION, PRO-LIFE CENTERS HAVE BEEN TARGETED BY 70% OF ABORTION-RELATED VIOLENT THREATS. KIRK CAMERON'S FILM LIFE MARK TELLS THE TRUE STORY OF DAVID SCOTT WHO WAS ADOPTED AND HIS JOURNEY OF REUNITING WITH HIS BIRTH PARENTS IS TOLD THROUGH STORY. HE WANTS TO THANK THEM FOR CHOOSING LIFE. HAY JOINS US NOW, ACTOR AND EXECUTIVE PRODUCER KIRK CAMERON WHO ADOPTED FOUR CHILDREN AND DAVID SCOTT. SO LET'S GO FIRST TO YOU, KIRK. FINISH SO YOU HAVE SIX CHILDREN, TWO BIOLOGICAL, POUR ADOPTED. IT IS NATIONAL -- FOUR ADOPTED. IT IS NATIONAL ADOPTION DAY. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO A FAMILY THAT IS PERHAPS CONTEMPLATING THE IDEA OF ADOPTION? [INAUDIBLE]  AND I HAVE A WIFE WHO'S ALSO AN ADOPTED CHILD. SO ADOPTION IS AT THE CENTER OF OUR HEART. AND I WOULD SAY THIS, ADOPTION IS A LOVING OPTION. IN FACT, GOD LOVES ADOPTION, AND AS WE MOVE INTO THE HOLIDAY SEASON, IT IS AT THE HEART OF THE CHRISTMAS STORY. MARY WAKES UP ONE DAY WITH AN UNPLANNED PREGNANCY. JOSEPH, FULL OF FAITH, LOVE FOR GOD AND FOR THE MOTHER, ADOPTS THE BABY BOY, RAISES HIM AS HIS OWN SON. AND THROUGH THAT ONE LOVING CHOICE NOT ONLY IS THE BABY SAVED, MARY TAKEN CARE OF, BUT RECONCILIATION, SALVATION AND NEW BEGINNINGS COME TO THE WHOLE WORLD. SO LEAN INTO ADOPTION. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL CHOICE. RACHEL: WOW, KIRK, YOU REALLY BRING THAT HOME. GOD WAS SENDING US A MESSAGE ABOUT ADOPTION FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE CHRISTMAS STORY. BEAUTIFUL. DAVID, YOU ARE -- YOU WERE ADOPTED. YOUR MOTHER HAD A VERY UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE. SHE WAS READY TO GET AN ABORTION AND AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE SHE CHANGED HER MIND, AND IT CHANGED YOUR LIFE. IT SAVED YOUR LIFE. SO TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT ADOPTION MEANS TO YOU.  ADOPTION MEANS EVERYTHING TO ME. MY BIRTH MOTHER WAS SECONDS AWAY FROM HAVING AN ABORTION, AND WITHOUT HER DECISION TO LEAVE THAT CLINIC AND CHOOSE ADOPTION, I WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY. THAT WAS A BRAVE, COURAGEOUS DECISION, AND I'M HERE BECAUSE OF THE ADOPTION OPTION. AND THAT'S WHY OOH MOVIES LIKE THIS ARE SO IS SPECIAL TO MY FAMILY. WE'RE GLAD TO BE A PART OF IT, GLAD THAT OUR STORY INSPIRED LIFEMARK. IT'S BEEN SO SO AMAZING TO SEE HOW STORY IS GOING TO DISPLAY THE BEAUTY OF ADOPTION. RACHEL: I MET YOU A LONG TIME AGO AND I HEARD YOUR STORY LONG BEFORE-A MOVIE -- BEFORE IT WAS A MOVIE. SO I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS FILM. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A CLIP FROM IT.  IMAGINE HOW SQUARED -- SCARED SHE MUST HAVE BEEN AND THEN DECIDING TO PLACE YOU FOR ADOPTION? MUST HAVE BEEN THE HARDEST DECISION OF HER ENTIRE LIFE. BUT I'M SO GLAD SHE DID. DAVID, GOD GAVE YOU TO ME AND MOM AS A GIFT, AND YOU'LL ALWAYS BE OUR SON. RACHEL: SO BEAUTIFUL. KIRK -- [LAUGHTER] I'M SO GLAD YOU CHOSE TO TELL DAVID'S STORY. IT'S JUST AMAZING, AND IT'S SO INSPIRATIONAL. RIGHT NOW IN THIS POST-ROE V. WADE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN, PRO-LIFE CENTERS ARE UNDER AN INCREDIBLE ATTACK. OVER 70 OF THEM HAVE HAD VIOLENT ATTACKS ON THEM INCLUDING MOLOTOV COCKTAILS. WHY DO YOU THINK THERE'S SO MUCH HOSTILITY TOWARDS PRO-LIFE CENTERS THAT ARE MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR WOMEN WHO WANT TO PUT THEIR BABIES UP FOR ADOPTION?  WELL, THERE'S SO MANY REASONS THAT WE COULD LOOK TOWARD TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY ACTS OF VIOLENCE WOULD GO TOWARD THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING TO SAVE LIFE. I THINK PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS ARGUMENT MISJUDGE THOSE OF US WHO LOVE LIFE AND CHAMPION LIFE AND WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE BEAUTY OF ADOPTION. WE SEE LIFE AS A GIFT FROM GOD. WE SEE LIFE AS SOMETHING THAT IS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT FOR ALL OF US. IF WE GET RID OF LIFE, WE DON'T HAVE LIBERTY, AND WE CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE HAPPINESS. SO WE WANT TO DEFEND IT, PROTECT IT AND FIGHT FOR IT AT ALL COSTS. RACHEL: DAVID, LAST WORD ON THIS.  I COULDN'T AGREE WITH KIRK MORE. I MEAN, WOMEN'S LIFE CENTERS ARE HELPING WOMEN, SO THE FACT THAT THEY'RE DESTROYING THOSE CENTERS IS VERY TELLING IN AND OF ITSELF. RACHEL: IT SURE IS. WELL, I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO SEE THIS STORY. AGAIN, IT'S CALLED LIFEMARK STARRING KIRK AND, AND IT'S DAVID'S STORY AND, BOY, I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT. WE THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING AND FOR BEING SUCH CHAMPIONS FOR LIFE AND FOR THE IDEA THAT EVERY LIFE MATTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING US.  THANK YOU. RACHEL: ALL RIGHT. FOR MORE BEAUTIFUL STORIES LIKE LIFEMARK, YOU CAN BUY HARRIS FAULKNER'S NEW BOOK, \"FAITH STILL MOVES MOUNTAINS\" AT FOX NEWS BOOKS.COM. > MORE \"FOX & friends\" COMING UP, IN FACT, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS APPOINTING YET ANOTHER SPECIAL COUNSEL TO OVERSEE TWO TRUMP-RELATED PROBES. CONGRESSMAN BYRON DONALDS ON THE POLITICIZATION OF THE DOJ, AND THAT'S NEXT. RACHEL: WE'RE BACK WITH A FOX NEWS WEATHER ALERT. THE NATIONAL GUARD IS DEPLOYED TO RESPOND TO THE SNOWSTORM SOCKING WESTERN NEW YORK AND STRANDING COUNTLESS DRIVERS. NEAR 6 FEET OF LAKE EFFECT SNOW CAUSING LOTS OF TROUBLE ACROSS UPSTATE NEW YORK. CHIEF METEOROLOGIST RICK REICHMUTH. RICK: 66 INCHES OF SNOW, PEOPLE WERE SENDING THOSE IN TO JANICE DEAN ON TWITTER. SEVEN THEM TO HER, SEND THEM TO ME ON TWITTER. WE LOVE GETTING THEM IF YOU CAN GET OUT AND SAFELY. WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF RAIN ACROSS PARTS OF THE GULF COAST, WE'RE GOING TO WATCH THAT THROUGHOUT THE DAY. BUT IF YOU GO TOWARDS THE GREAT LAKES, DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A LOT, IT'S JUST THAT LITTLE LINE RIGHT WILL IS PERSISTENT. IT DOESN'T MOVE. GOES OVER THE EXACT SAME AREA FOR A LONG TIME, AND THAT'S WHY WE SEE THESE INCREDIBLE SNOWFALL TOTALS ESPECIALLY TO THE SOUTH OF BUFFALO. AND NOW THAT LINE OVERNIGHT MOVED THROUGH THE BUFFALO AREA, NOW IT'S TO THE NORTH, IT'LL STAY THAT WAY MUCH OF THE DAY TODAY, EVENTUALLY WE'LL SEE THE WIND SHIFT COMING OUT OF THE NORTHWEST, HEAVIER SNOW TOWARDS CLEVELAND AND AROUND ERIE LATER TODAY. ALSO THE OTHER GREAT LAKES STILL HAVING SOME LAKE EFFECT SNOW, WE HAVEN'T TALKED AS MUCH ABOUT THAT, BUT WESTERN SIDE OF MICHIGAN, LOOK AT THAT SNOW THAT'S FALLING THERE AS WELL. HEY, THIS IS THE BIG TRAVEL WEEK. DOWNLOAD THE FOX WEATHER APP SO YOU CAN GET HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS SAFELY. THEY WILL KEEP YOU UP-TO-DATE ON THE NATION'S AIRPORTS AND ROADS WITH THE FOX WEATHER APP. WILL, OVER TO YOU. WILL: THANK YOU, RICK. FORMER BUSINESS ASSOCIATE OF HUNTER BIDEN, TONY BOBULINSKI, BELIEVES A GOP-CONTROLLED HOUSE WILL BRING CORRUPTION TO LIGHT.  IT'S CRAZY THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS TWO YEARS AFTER I'VE COME PUBLIC. A THOUSAND PERCENT JOE BIDEN IS THE BIG GUY. MULTIPLE WHISTLEBLOWERS HAVE COME FORWARD WITH A WHOLE TROVE OF FACTS THAT CORROBORATE EVERYTHING I'VE SAID AS WELL AS ADD A INCREMENTAL INFORMATION TO IT. AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SEE THOSE FACTS, I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE SHOCKED BY THOSE FACTS AND, HOPEFULLY, JUSTICE IS SERVED. WILL: F -- FLORIDA CONGRESSMAN BYRON DONALDS JOINS US THIS MORNING. GOOD MORNING, CONGRESSMAN, GREAT TO SEE YOU. WHAT ARE THE PLANS? CAN YOU TELL US BEHIND THE SCENES ONCE THE GOP TAKES CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, WHAT CAN GET ACCOMPLISHED WHEN IT COMES TO THE CORRUPTION SCANDAL INVOLVING HUNTER BIDEN AND POTENTIALLY JOE BIDEN?  WELL, LOOK, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S GOOD TO BE WITH YOU THIS MORNING. THE FIRST THING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY GO AND WHETHER IT'S MAKE FORMAL REQUESTS AS THE MAJORITY THAT RUNS THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE OR EVEN HAVE TO GO AS FAR AS SUBPOENAS FOR SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTS. NOW WE'RE BEING TOLD THE NUMBER'S ABOUT 150 THAT HUNTER BIDEN AND JIM BIDEN HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN THROUGH THEIR VARIOUS BUSINESS PRACTICES. MOST PEOPLE WILL SAY WHAT IS A SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORT IN WELL, THESE ARE REPORTS WHERE THE BANKING SYSTEM WILL FLAG AN ACCOUNT THAT SENDS MONEY TO ANOTHER ACCOUNT THAT MIGHT BE INVOLVED IN SOME SORT OF MONEY LAUNDERING, FRAUD, ETC. AND EVERY BANK IN THE COUNTRY CREATES THESE REPORTS, AND THEY FLAG THE ACCOUNTS THAT ARE TIED IN THIS TRANSACTION STREAM. MOST PEOPLE MIGHT GET ONE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORT IN THEIR LIFETIME, MAYBE ONE. WE ALREADY KNOW THAT HUNTER BIDEN AND JIM BIDEN ARE TIED TO 150. WILL: WOW.  SO IT STARTS THERE. AND WHEN YOU GO DOWN THAT PROCESS, YOU SEE WHERE THE EVIDENCE LEADS. REAL QUICK, LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE ON THAT, WHEN JOE BIDEN BECAME PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HE CHANGED THE RULES ON CONGRESS' ABILITY TO VIEW AND HAVE ACCESS TO THESE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTS. SO, JOE, WHY'D YOU CHANGE THE RULES? THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING TO START, AND THE INVESTS WILL GO FROM THERE -- INVESTIGATIONS WILL GO FROM THERE. WILL: ALL RIGHT. THE STARTING POINT IS GOING TO BE, I'M SURE, ARDUOUS IN TERMS OF ITS SIZE AND SCOPE, CONGRESSMAN. IN THE MEANTIME, THE WHITE HOUSE IS SAYING ANY INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE BIDEN FAMILY ARE PART OF A CONSPIRACY THEORY. THEY SAY INSTEAD OF WORKING WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN TO ADDRESS ISSUES IMPORTANT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LIKE LORE COSTS, CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS' TOP PRIORITY IS TO GO AFTER PRESIDENT BIDEN WITH POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ATTACKS CHOCK FULL OF LONG DEBUNKED CONSPIRACY THEORIES. I THINK YOU CAN REST EASY NOW THAT IT'S BEEN KISS MISSED AS A CONSPIRACY -- DISMISSED AS A CONSPIRACY THEORY, YOU'RE ON TO THE TRUTH. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. MERRICK GARLAND HAS APPOINTED A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR TO DETERMINE AND LOOK INTO FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE COLLECTION OF DOCUMENTS THERE AT MAR-A-LAGO AND THE TRANSFER OF POWER ON JANUARY 6TH. JUST A FEW DAYS AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP ANNOUNCES HIS CAMPAIGN FOR RE-ELECTION IN 2024 TO THE PRESIDENCY. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?  FIRST OF ALL, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WANTS THE TALK ABOUT WITCH HUNTS? THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. DEALING WITH THIS NOW, SPECIAL PROSECUTOR FROM MERRICK GARLAND. FOLKS, LET'S GO DOWN MEMORY LANE. ON JANUARY 4TH, DONALD TRUMP AUTHORIZED 10,000 NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS TO BE AT THE U.S. CAPITOL FOR JANUARY 6TH. HE AUTHORIZED THAT. THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE DIDN'T BEG HIM FOR THAT, HE WAIL GAVE THAT SUPPORT TO THE HOUSE. SO THE QUESTION BECOMES IF YOU'RE GOING TO CALL THE NATIONAL GUARD IN, HOW ARE YOU THEN ALSO TRYING TO CREATE CONSPIRACIES TO FOMENT JANUARY 6TH? THAT'S WHY THE DEMOCRATS' PLAY ON THIS HAS BEEN DUMB FROM THE BEGINNING. NUMBER TWO, WE'RE REALLY GOING TO HAVE A SPAT OVER DOCUMENTS BETWEEN THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES AND A FORMER PRESIDENT, NOT THE FBI, NOT THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY, THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES. THESE ARE WITCH HUNTS. TO GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS POINT ABOUT WHAT JOE BIDEN SAID, MR. PRESIDENT, IT'S NOT A CONSPIRACY. BECAUSE UNDER PRESIDENT TRUMP, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND PRESIDENT BUSH CONGRESS HAD FULL AUTHORITY TO SEE THOSE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTS. YOU BECOME PRESIDENT AND NOW THE RULES CHANGE? THAT SMELLS FISHY, WE'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE. THIS SPECIAL COUNSELING -- COUNSEL IS A JOKE TO ME. WILL: WELL, THE POINT I WAS MAKING AS WELL AS -- [INAUDIBLE] OTHERS ACCUSING YOU OF INDULGING IN CONSPIRACY. THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS EVERY TIME SOMEONE HAS SAID THAT'S A SPEAKS IT HAS ALMOST ALWAYS TURNED OUT THERE ARE FACTUAL TRUTHS UNDERNEATH. SO COUNT YOURSELF IN GOOD COMPANY WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER NEWS STORIES. YOU'RE ON TO THE TRUTH WHEN IT COMES TO HUNTER BIDEN. WE ALWAYS LOVE TALKING TO YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THANK YOU. ANYTIME. WILL: RACHEL, OVER TO YOU. RACHEL: WHEN I HEAR HIM, I ACTUALLY HI WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. [LAUGHTER] IT'S VERY BELIEVABLE. NOW TO A FOX NEWS ALERT. POLICE NOW SAYING TWO OF THE MURDERED COLLEGE STUDENTS IN AN IDAHO QUADRUPLE HOMICIDE -- [AUDIO DIFFICULTY] POLICE PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT THE TWO MAY HAVE TAKEN AN UBER. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHO DROVE THAT PRIVATE VEHICLE. THIS UPDATE COMING AS POLICE CONTINUE TO SEARCH FOR A SUSPECT AS THE CORONER SAYS SOME OF THE VICTIMS MAY HAVE BEEN IN BED ASLEEP WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED. THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN AMY OF PEDIATRICS ARE CALLING ON PRESIDENT BIDEN TO DECLARE A HEALTH EMERGENCY DUE TO UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS OF RESPIRATORY AND FLU IF INFECTIONS. FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR DRS EARLIER ON THIS.  THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE LOCKDOWN THAT WE HAVE NOT YET MEASURED, AND WE'RE SEEING THESE HOSPITALIZATIONS IN MAAS NUMBERS. YOUR BODY'S NOT GETTING THAT LOW LEVEL OF VIRAL EXPOSURE THAT BUILDS IMMUNITY AT A LOW LEVEL AND IT MAY BE SUBCLINICAL, YOU MAY NOT NOTICE IT. SO THAT'S PROBABLY WHY WE'RE SEEING THIS MASSIVE INFLUX OF RSV AND INFLUENZA AND OTHER INFECTIONS RIGHT NOW ACCOUNTING FOR HOSPITALIZATIONS IN CHILDREN. RACHEL: ONE BIDEN OFFICIAL SAYING THEIR ADMINISTRATION IS, QUOTE, READY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITIES WHO ARE IN NEED OF HELP ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS. > THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TAKING ACTION FOLLOWING THE TAYLOR SWIFT TICKETMASTER FIASCO. DOJ'S INVESTIGATING PARENT COMPANY LIVE NATION OVER THE BOTCHED PRESALE THAT ANGERED FANS, AND NOW TAYLOR SWIFT IS SPEAKING OUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA POSTING, QUOTE: IT'S THE REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO TRUST AN OUTSIDE ENTITY WITH THESE RELATIONSHIPS AND LOYALTIES, AND IT'S EXCRUCIATING FOR ME TO JUST WATCH MISTAKES HAPPEN WITH NO RECOURSE. THOSE ARE YOUR HEADLINES. SO WE HAVE A BIG SHOW TOMORROW. CONGRESSWOMAN NANCY MACE, MIKE HUCKABEE, MARIA BARTIROMO, KRISSAH THOMPSON AND JOE CONCHA. BUT FIRST, IT'S ALMOST THANKSGIVING, AND WE'RE HAVING OUR OWN FEAST ON FOX SQUARE WITH THE McHE MOTHERS AND MASTERBUILT. \u266a I WANT SOME HOT STUFF, BABY, THIS EVENING \u266a 20221119144752.200|20221119145000.261",

        "trs": " WELCOME TO FOX NEWS LIVE. I'M MATT FIN IN LOS ANGELES. GRIZZLY NEW DETAILS ABOUT THE KILLING OF FOUR COLLEGE STUDENTS IN MOSCOW, IDAHO. ACCORDING TO A CORONER, SYMPTOM OR ALL WERE FOUND STABBED TO DEATH IN THEIR BEDS, AND MIGHT HAVE BEEN ASLEEP WHEN THEY WERE ATTACKED. THE BODIES WERE FOUND LAST SUNDAY. THERE'S NO SUSPECT OR MOTIVE. AUTHORITIES HAVE RELEASED A MAP, TRACING THE VICTIMS' LAST MOVES. > ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND HAS NAMED A SPECIAL COUNSEL INTO FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE DOJ IS INVESTIGATING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS FOUND AT THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S MAR-A-LAGO HOME. THERE'S A SEPARATE PROBE INVESTIGATING THE ORIGINS OF THE JANUARY 6TH RIOTS, DAYS AFTER TRUMP FORMALLY LAUNCHED HIS 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUN. NOW BACK TO \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.\"  Tucker: SO IT MAY BE LOOKING BACK, SAY, 10 YEARS FROM NOW, ONE OF THE MOST SEQUENCAL DECISIONS IN THE HISTORY OF BIG TECH MAY HAVE BEEN TWITTER'S DECISION TO BAN BABYLON BEE. WHAT DID THE SITE DO WR WRONG? TWITTER'S BAN WAS PUBLICIZED. ELON MUSK SAW IT, AND WAS OUTRAGED BY IT. NOT BECAUSE HE'S A RIGHT WINGER, BECAUSE HE BELIEVES IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT. ELON MUSK NOW OWNS TWITTER AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO DESTROY HIM. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INVESTIGATING HIM. THE PRESIDENT FROM THE PODIUM NOT LONG AGO, SUGGESTED HE MIGHT BE A THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY. SO ALL OF THIS BEGAN WITH THE BANNING OF THE BABYLON BEE. SETH DILLON IS THE CEO OF BABYLON BEE AND JOINS US TONIGHT. THANKS FOR COMING ON. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BANNED ON TWITTER, BUT WHEN YOU GOT BANNED, HE SEEMED TO SEE IT AS A RED LINE BEING CROSSED. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?  I THINK IT ALL GOES BACK TO THE PRIMARY ISSUE OF FREE SPEECH. HE CALLS HIMSELF A FREE SPEECH ABSOLUTIST. ONE OF THE THINGS FREE SPEECH PROTECTS IS JOKES. WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN LAUGH, POKE FUN AT THESE IDEAS, ESPECIALLY IDEAS THAT ARE REALLY CRAZY, WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THIS WORLD VIEW NEEDS TO BE PROPPED UP. THE LEFT'S INSANE IDEOLOGY NEEDS TO BE PROPPEDDA BY SILENCING PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE, ESPECIALLY BY PEOPLE WHO EXPOSE THEIR FOOLISHNESS. I THINK MUSK SAW THAT AS PROBLEMATIC. IT'S PART OF THE REASON WHY HE DECIDED TO STEP IN AND TAKE SOME ACTION.  Tucker: I'M GLAD HE DID. DO HE'S THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD, FAMOUSLY, OR HE WAS WHEN HE BOUGHT IT, IN ANY CASE, BUT THERE'S SO MUCH INSTITUTIONAL RESISTANCE TO ALLOWING AMERICANS TO SPEAK FREELY. DO YOU THINK HE WILL BE ABLE TO RESTORE FREE SPEECH, LEGAL SPEECH, MIGHT BE A BETTER DEFINITION, TO TWITTER?  I HOPE SO. I MEAN, FOR ALL OF OUR SAKES, I HOPE SO. THERE'S A LOT OF RESISTANCE. HE'S FACING PRESSURING FROM ADVERTISERS, FACING PRESSURE FROM ACTIVIST GROUPS. THEY HAVE THIS SYSTEM SET UP, THIS POWER, EMPOWERED ACTIVISTS BY GIVING THEM A SWORD AND SHIELD, RIGHT? THEY CAN STRIKE DOWN ANYTHING AS MISINFORMATION OR HATE SPEECH THAT THEY WANT. ETHIC SMEAR YOU ALL THEY WANT. THEY HAVE A SHIELD ON THE OTHER SIDE. THAT'S THEIR SWORD. THEY HAVE A SHIELD ON THE OTHER SIDE, WHERE YOU CAN'T CRITICIZE THEM OR YOU GET BANNED. MUSK HAS THREATENED TO TAKE AWAY THAT SHIELD. THEY WILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH TO PREVENT HIM FROM DOING THAT. HE'S GOT A TOUGH BATTLE AHEAD OF HIM.  Tucker: I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE OVERSTATING IT. I THINK THE WORD \"EXISTENTIAL,\" BUT THAT IS THIS FOR THEM. DID YOU UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT CENSORSHIP WAS FOR THE PEOPLE CURRENTLY IN CHARGE TO KEEP THEIR POWER? I MEAN, THEY SEEM TO THINK IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.  THEY DO. I MEAN, THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT. YOU KNOW, MOCKERY AND -- AND -- AND CRITICISM, YOU KNOW, IT CAN EXPOSE FOOLISHNESS, MAKE YOU LOOK SILLY. I THINK THAT'S THE BIG WEAK POINT, ESPECIALLY WHEN IDEAS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DEFEND ARE INDEFENSIBLE. YOU KNOW, YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE ARGUMENTS ABOUT IT. YOU WANT TO SHUT DOWN THE DEBATE BEFORE THE DEBATE EVEN HAPPENS. YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T EXPECT THAT IT WOULD COME TO THE POINT IT'S COME TO, THAT WE'D SEE THE AMOUNT OF CONTENT MODERATION WE'RE SEEING, THAT BASICALLY SILENCES ONE SIDE OF THE DISCUSSION AND TAKES OUT PEOPLE TRYING TO USE HUMOR EFFECTIVELY IN A CONVERSATION. YOU KNOW, HERE WE ARE, WE'RE IN THIS PLACE. I DON'T KNOW. I'M EXCITED, HOPEFUL, THAT MUSK WILL FIGHT BACK AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. HE'S FACING CHALLENGES RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.  Tucker: YEAH, HE CERTAINLY IS. SETH DILLON, WHOSE BANNING STARTED IT ALL. GREAT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU.  Tucker: SO WE OPENED THE SHOW TELLING YOU ABOUT THE COMEDIAN JOSH DENNY, SILENCED AS A COMEDIAN BECAUSE HE HAS PRO-LIFE VIEWS. HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE, THOUGH. JOHN GIBSON WAS THE CEO OF TRIPWIRE, A VIDEO GAME COMPANY. LAST YEAR HE TWEETED THIS, AND THIS IS THE WHOLE TWEET. QUOTE, PROUD OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT AFFIRMING THAT TEXAS LAW BANNING ABORTION FOR BABIES WITH A HEARTBEAT. AS AN ENTERTAINER I DON'T GET POLITICAL OFTEN, YET WITH SO MANY VOCAL PEERS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISSUE I FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GO ON THE RECORD ACE PRO-LIFE GAME DEVELOPER.\" THAT WAS IT. HE DIDN'T ATTACK ANYONE, JUST SAID WHAT HE BELIEVED. FOR TWEETING THAT, HE LOST HIS JOB. THE COMPANY THAT HE STARTED, WAS MAJORITY OWNER OF, OR HAD THE LARGEST OWNERSHIP STAKE IN, AND THEN THE MEDIA DECIDED TO DESTROY HIM PERSONALLY. UNBELIEVABLE EXPERIENCE. WE SPOKE TO HIM ABOUT IT. HERE'S PART OF THE CONVERSATION.  I CALL IT SOCIAL TERRORISM.  YES.  IT IS AN EFFORT TO USE FEAR AND INTIMIDATION TO CAUSE PEOPLE TO CHANGE -- EITHER -- EITHER HIDE OR PRETEND THAT THEY'RE NOT TO WHAT THEY ARE REALLY SO THEY CAN KEEP THEIR JOBS, THEY CAN KEEP THEIR STATUS, AND I JUST THINK THAT'S -- THAT'S JUST A TERRIBLE THING FOR THE WORLD.  Tucker: WELL, IT'S PRIMA FACIA EVIL FOR ONE THING. TERRORISM IS ALWAYS WRONG. YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING SHOULD BE VOLUNTARY. I MEAN, YOU CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE TO BELIEVE SOMETHING. THAT'S CRAZY. YOU KNOW, THAT'S EIGHTH CENTURY ISLAM, BEING BEHEADED OR SOMETHING. THERE WAS NOT ONE PERSON -- BY THE WAY, I WROTE DOWN SOCIAL TERRORISM, BECAUSE I'M STEALING THAT. I'M NOT GIVING YOU CREDIT. SORRY. IT'S SUCH A PRECISE PHRASE VERSUS COUNTER CULTURE, WHICH IS PATHETIC AND WEAK, AND DOES NOT DESCRIBE THE PHENOMENON. NOT ONE PERSON IN YOUR WORLD STOOD UP AND SAID WE CANNOT CRUSH THIS MAN BECAUSE HE HAS A DIFFERENT VIEW?  THERE WAS -- UMM, THERE WAS ONE PERSON, WITHIN THE COMPANY, THAT -- UMM, UMM, A LADY THAT WAS RESISTANT TO WHAT THEY WERE DOING TO ME.  Tucker: GOOD FOR HER.  UMM, AND SHE WAS FAIRLY SENIOR. UMM, AND I REALLY APPRECIATED HER, YOU KNOW, SORT OF STANDING UP AND PUSHING BACK. BUT IT WAS -- IT WAS -- IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HER, TOO. I MEAN, SHE WAS OUTNUMBERED. UMM, AND -- BUT ALSO IN THE POSITION SHE WAS IN, SHE WAS HAVING TO DEAL WITH A LOT OF THE FALLOUT, AND THAT'S -- THAT'S HOW THIS SOCIAL TERRORISM WORKS, IS YOU MAKE PEOPLE SCARED. YOU MAKE THEIR JOBS MORE DIFFICULT. YOU MAKE THEM WORRY THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LEAVE THE COMPANY IF THEY DON'T, YOU KNOW, THROW THE PERSON WHO -- WHO DISAGREED WITH IN AS POLITICAL POSITIONS OUT OF THE BOAT. AND, UMM, SO SHE REALLY COULDN'T OVERCOME THE WAVE OF SENTIMENT OF THE OTHER FOLKS. THEN THE PEOPLE THAT -- THAT -- THE OTHER PEOPLE THAT AGREED, THEY'RE AFRAID TO SPEAK UP. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE NEXT. UMM, I HAD ONE OF THE OWNER OWE OTHER OWNERS OF THE COMPANY POLITICALLY WERE VERY, VERY, UMM, WERE VERY ALIGNED. HE THINKS CANCEL CULTURE IS BAD. HE THINKS ABORTION IS BAD. UMM, AND HE SAID, UMM, YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO BE CANCELED NEXT.  Tucker: HOW HEARTBREAKING WAS THAT? I MEAN, THESE ARE YOUR FRIENDS. YOU CREATED THE COMPANY WITH THEM. YOU WORKED WITH THEM FOR 20 YEARS. TO SEE THEM PARTICIPATE IN THIS MUST HAVE DESTROYED YOU.  TUCKER, WORDS -- WORDS CAN HARDLY CONVEY, UMM, HOW CRUSHED I WAS. UMM, YOU -- EVERYONE THAT WORKS PUTS A LITTLE BIT OF THEMSELVES INTO SOMETHING, OR MAYBE A LOT.  Tucker: YEAH.  WHEN YOU'RE DOING -- WHEN YOU'RE SOMETHING THAT -- LIKE THIS, A PASSION, SOMETHING YOU USED TO DO FOR FREE, AND YOU JUST ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT, AND IT'S -- YOU SPENT 20 YEARS, 25 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE, CRAFTING THE SKILL SET, AND YOU'RE AT THE TOP OF YOUR GAME, AND YOU LOVE WHAT YOU DO EVERY DAY, JUST LOVE COMING INTO WORK, AND MAKING PEOPLE HAPPY. AND WE -- WE WERE MAKING, SURE, MILLIONS OF FANS HAPPY, BUT ALSO THE COMPANY WOULD TAKE 10% OF OUR PROFITS AND DIVIDE IT UP AMONGST THE EMPLOYEES. THERE WAS A LOT OF PROFIT. PEOPLE WERE GOING OUT AND BUYING CARS AND HOUSES. I WOULD SEE PEOPLE COMING INTO WORK, SMILING AND HAPPY. I JUST LOVED HAVING A JOB WHERE I GOT TO MAKE, NOT JUST THE PUBLIC HAPPY, BUT THE EMPLOYEES HAPPY. AND TO HAVE THAT ALL DESTROYED, UMM, TO FEEL LIKE -- WELL, I SHARED SOMETHING WITH MY WIFE. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I SAID TO HER. I SAID -- I SAID I JUST WANT TO DIE, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LIVE -- I DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN A WORLD THAT'S THIS UNJUST.  Tucker: I AGREE.  AND YEAH. YEAH, I GOT DEPRESSED. I GOT, OF COURSE, ANGRY, SUICIDAL. UMM, NOT WANTING TO LEAVE THE HOUSE. UMM -- YEAH, IT DESTROYED ME. AND I HAVE LIVED THROUGH 13 MONTHS OF HELL.  Tucker: THE ENTIRE EPISODE WILL BE AVAILABLE NEXT WEEK TO STREAM ON FOX NATION. WELL, IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO THAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WAS TRYING TO CENSOR YOU IN AN OBVIOUS WAY WITH THE MINISTRY OF TRUTH, AND MARY POPPINS IN CHARGE OF IT, AND THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SUCCEEDED. WHAT EXACTLY WOULD THIS COUNTRY LOOK LIKE? THAT'S NEXT. 20221119014314.806|20221119014810.201",

THESE ARE BRAVE MEMBERS OF OUR AIR AND MARINE OPERATIONS WITHIN U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION. THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS JOB CANNOT BE COMPARED TO THE DIFFICULTY THAT OUR FRONT LINE PERSONNEL FACE EVERY DAY. THEIR BRAVERY AND SELFLESS SERVICE SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED.  THE HOMELAND SECURITY SECTOR ON THE CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION AGENT KILLED IN A SHOOT OUT WITH A SUSPECTED SMUGGLING BOAT JUST OFF THE COAST OF PUERTO RICO. TWO OTHER AGENTS INJURED AS THEY APPROACHED THAT VESSEL. FORMER ICE AND DHS AGENT JOINS US IN A MOMENT. CASEY STIEGEL LIVE WITH THE STORY TODAY.  THE AGENTS WERE ON PATROL IN A BOAT OFF THE COAST OF PUERTO RICO ON THURSDAY. IT HAPPENS TO BE A MAJOR ROUTE THAT CARTELS USE TO MOVE COCAINE OUT OF SOUTH AMERICA. OFFICIALS SAY AGENTS CAME UNDER FIRE FROM A SUSPECTED SMUGGLING VESSEL AND A SHOOT-OUT ENSUED. ALL THESE U.S. AGENTS WERE HIT AND AIRLIFTED BUT ONE DIED, TWO OTHERS GRAVELY WOUNDED. CBP COMMISSIONER TROY MILLER RELEASED WHEN STATEMENT LATE YESTERDAY. OUR HEARTS ARE HEAVY TODAY DUE TO THE DEATH AND INJURY OF MARINE INTERDICTION AGENTS FOLLOWING AN EXCHANGE OF GUNFIRE WITH SUSPECTED SMUGGLERS OFF THE PUERTO RICO COAST. WORKING WITH PARTNERS TO INSURE THOSE RESPONSIBLE ARE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE AND WILL SHARE INFO AS WE'RE ABLE. THAT PARTICULAR SPOT HAS BEEN AWFULLY BUSY LATELY. THE DAY BEFORE $2 MILLION WORTH OF COCAINE WAS RECOVERED FROM A CAPSIZED BOAT ABOUT A MILE OFF THE PUERTO RICAN COAST. 198 POUNDS WORTH OF THE DRUG BUT PALES IN COMPARISON TO A BUST EARLIER IN THE WEEK WHEN AGENTS NABBED 13 BAILS OF COCAINE OFF A VESSEL THERE. THAT'S WEIGHING IN AT 851 POUNDS. A STREET VALUE OF $7.1 MILLION. ALL THE WHILE HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY THE SAME PICTURE IS DAY IN AND OUT IN EAGLE PASS, TEXAS, HUNDREDS OF MIGRANTS CONTINUE TO ILLEGALLY CROSS THE BORDER IN RECORD NUMBERS. NOT ONLY THERE BUT ACROSS THE NEARLY 2,000 MILE-LONG STRETCH AS WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING. YESTERDAY'S SHOOT-OUT A TRAGIC REMINDER OF JUST HOW DANGEROUS IT IS FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO ARE OUT THERE WORKING THE FRONT LINES OF THIS CRISIS, BILL.  Bill: CASEY STIEGEL IN DALLAS, THANK YOU.  Sandra: LET'S BRING IN VICTOR AVILA RETIRED ICE SPECIAL AGENT WHOSE PARTNER WAS KILLED BY A DRUG CARTEL. HORRIFIC TO SEE WHAT PLAYED OUT AS YOU HEARD FROM MAYORKAS CALLING THE BRAVE MEMBERS SAYING THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS JOB CANNOT BE COMPARED TO THE DIFFICULTY OF OUR FRONT LINE PERSONNEL AND WHAT THEY FACE EVERY SINGLE DAY HONORING THEIR BRAVERY AND SELFLESSNESS. YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED LOSS FIRSTHAND WHEN IT COMES TO THE DRUG CARTELS. WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THIS CBP AGENT GETTING KILLED?  FIRST OF ALL MY CONDOLENCES TO THE FAMILY OF THE AGENT LOST IN THE LINE OF DUTY AND TO THOSE THAT WERE INJURED I WISH THEM A SPEEDY RECOVERY. I KNOW, I'VE BEEN THERE. IT IS A TRAGEDY BUT ALSO SHOWS THE TIMES WE'RE IN AND THE BRAZEN ACTIVITY BY THESE CARTELS. AND IT GOES TO SHOW IT IS JUST NOT HAPPENING JUST IN THE SOUTHERN BORDER BUT ALSO ON OUR OCEANS. COCAINE MAKING A BIG COMEBACK. I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW THAT WE HAVE A FENTANYL CRISIS, METHAMPHETAMINE BUT ALSO COCAINE CONTINUE TO POUR INTO THE COUNTRY FROM EVERY DIRECTION. THE CARTELS ARE NOW RESPONDING WITH LETHAL FORCE. THIS IS EVEN A MORE INDICATION THAT WE MUST SECURE OUR BORDERS THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR BORDERS FROM EVERY SIDE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR COUNTRY SAFE.  Sandra: THESE TWO OTHERS THAT WERE GRAVELY INJURED. WE'LL CONTINUE TO WAIT FOR AN UPDATE ON THEM. THIS HAPPENS JUST ONE DAY AFTER BORDER AGENTS DISCOVERED $2 MILLION WORTH OF COCAINE IN A CAPSIZED BOAT OFF THE PUERTO RICAN COAST AND AGENTS DISCOVERED A -- IT SEEMS THERE ARE SO MANY OF THESE STORIES AND SO MUCH OF THIS HAPPENING EVERY DAY. IS THIS A SITUATION THAT IS ONLY GETTING WORSE?  IT ABSOLUTELY IS ONLY GETTING WORSE. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE ACTIVITY OF THE CARTELS HAVE AND NO REGARD FOR HUMAN LIFE. AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO BRING THEIR DRUGS, HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND HUMAN SMUGGLING INTO OUR COUNTRY FOR THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MONEY THEY'RE MAKING. THEY ARE FOREIGN ACTIVITY ORGANIZATIONS AND START DESIGNATING THEM AS SUCH BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TERRORIZEING OTHER COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY MEXICO AND OUR OWN COUNTRY WITH THE DEATHS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WITH FENTANYL POISONINGS. IT IS IMPORTANCE WE FACE. IT IS UNBELIEVABLE TO ME THAT PEOPLE STILL SOMETIMES DENY WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. YOU GUYS HAVE DONE A WONDERFUL JOB IN SHOWING THESE PICTURES. SOMEHOW IT IS NOT ENOUGH SHOWING THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY ILLEGALLY BUT THE NATIONAL SECURITY AND PUBLIC SAFETY EFFORT THAT WE MUST PAY ATTENTION TO TO SECURE OUR BORDER, TO KEEP OUR CITIZENS SAFE IN EVERY BORDER AND EVERY STATE. THESE SEIZURES ARE HAPPENING IN PUERTO RICO AND PORTLAND AND IN WISCONSIN, ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES. WE MUST TAKE CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS AND HOLD MAYORKAS ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT.  Sandra: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR TAKING MATTERS INTO HIS OWN HANDS SAYING IT IS AN ADMINISTRATION DOING NOTHING AND INVOKING THE INVASION CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE OF WHAT HE IS LABELING FAILURES OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO TACKLE THE CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HIM GOING IN THAT DIRECTION?  WELL, HE HAS NO CHOICE BECAUSE OF THE FAILURES OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. I WILL HEAD DOWN TO THE BORDER RIGHT AFTER THANKSGIVING AND SEE IF, IN FACT, IT IS BEING ENFORCED. ONE THING IS TO BE SAID AND THE OTHER THING IS TO BE ENFORCED. I WANT TO SEE IF THEY'RE KEEPING PEOPLE AWAY. AS OF TODAY I HAVEN'T SEEN IT. WE'LL SEE IF THIS DECLARATION BY GOVERNOR ABBOTT WILL BE ENFORCED. I HOPE IT IS. THE SAME THING IN ARIZONA AND OTHER STATES. WE NEED TO GET TOGETHER AND DEFEND OUR BORDERS AND SAVE LIVES.  Sandra: WE'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU AFTER YOUR VISIT TO THE BORDER.  THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.  Sandra: BILL.  70% OF OUR ABORTION-RELATED VIOLENCE CASES OR THREATS CASES ARE CASES OF VIOLENCE OR THREATS AGAINST PRO-LIFE. THE VICTIMS ARE PRO-LIFE ORGANIZATIONS. AND WE'RE GOING AFTER THAT THROUGH OUR JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCES.  Bill: THAT'S THE HEAD OF THE F.B.I. THE BUREAU IS SEEING A SURGE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST PRO-LIFE GROUPS. WHY HAVEN'T THEY PROSECUTED A SINGLE CASE TO DATE? WHITE HOUSE SAYING WE'LL ASK THE SUPREME COURT TO REINSTATE THE PRESIDENT'S STUDENT LOAN WRITE-OFF. A $4 HUNDRED BILLION BILL AT STAKE. 20221118152525.054|20221118153030.626",

        "trs": " Sandra: FOX NEWS ALERT. STATE OF EMERGENCY IN WESTERN NEW YORK OVER A MILLION PEOPLE BRACING FOR A CRIPPLING SNOWSTORM THERE. THIS IS LIVE VIDEO OUT OF BUFFALO, NEW YORK. THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE SAYS BUFFALO COULD SEE UP TO FOUR FEET -- NOT FOUR INCH, FOUR FEET OF LAKE-EFFECT SNOW BY THE END OF THIS WEEKEND. HERE IS A LIVE LOOK AT THE CONDITIONS. SNOW ALREADY BLANKETING THAT CITY. OF COURSE, YOU POINT OUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS HEADING INTO A BIG HOLIDAY WEEK. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE TRAVEL PLANS. WE HOPE PEOPLE ARE SAFE. THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG ONE, BILL.  Bill: I WOULD SAY. WE'RE GETTING NOTHING.  Sandra: LOOK AT THAT SKY. HOLY COW.  Bill: BE THAT WAY ALL DAY. THAT'S FROM BUFFALO. THIS FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. NOW. THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR ANNOUNCING YESTERDAY THAT 70% OF ABORTION-RELATED THREATS OF VIOLENCE IN THE U.S. SINCE THE DOBBS DECISION HAVE BEEN AGAINST PRO-LIFE GROUPS. YET NOT A SINGLE CASE HAS BEEN PROSECUTED BY D.O.J. DAVID SPUNT IS LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER ON THAT.  GOOD MORNING. PRO-LIFE ADVOCATES SAY IT'S A DOUBLE STANDARD AND ARE USING THE WORDS DIRECTLY FROM THE MOUTH OF F.B.I. DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY. WHEN THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNED ROE V. WADE BACK IN JUNE THE F.B.I. DIRECTOR TOLD A SENATE PANEL ROUGHLY 70% OF THE VIOLENCE ABORTION-RELATED VIOLENCE CASES INVOLVE ATTACKS ON PRO-LIFE BUSINESSES, PEOPLE OR GROUPS. THIS ACCORDING TO WRAY YESTERDAY. FEDERAL PROSECUTORS HAVE 26 CASES IN THE TYPE LINE INVOLVING PEOPLE WHO ATTACKED ABORTION CLINICS AND PRO-CHOICE SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS PROSECUTED NOT ONE PERSON FOR ATTACKS ON PRO-LIFE CENTERS.  WE HAVE 20 FIELD OFFICES INVOLVED IN THIS. WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY. I DON'T CARE WHETHER YOU ARE MOTIVATED BY PRO-LIFE OR PRO-CHOICE VIEWS YOU DON'T GET TO USE VIOLENCE TO EXPRESS IT.  F.B.I. RELEASED NEW FOOTAGE OF SOMEONE ATTACKING A PRO-LIFE PREGNANCY RESOURCE CENTER IN BUFFALO, NEW YORK. AUTHORITIES ARE OFFERING A $25,000 REWARD. CALL THE F.B.I. WITH INFORMATION. PRO-LIFE GROUPS WANT ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND TO PUT MORE RESOURCES IN PROSECUTION.  APPLY THE LAW FAIRLY AND EQUALLY AND LOOK INTO THESE MANY ATTACKS.  NO PROSECUTIONS YET ON THE PRO-LIFE SIDE. ATTACKS ON PRO-LIFE CENTERS. HOWEVER, IN JUNE IS WHEN THEY STARTED TO PICK UP. I'M TOLD THEY COULD TRICKLE IN DOWN THE PIPELINE. TAKES A WHILE TO BUILD A CASE BUT SOMETHING WE'LL BE WATCHING.  Bill: DAVID SPUNT AT D.O.J.  Sandra: THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION NOT GIVING UP ON ITS STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS PLAN SAYING IT WILL TAKE THE FIGHT ALL THE WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT. HERE ON THAT IS SHANNON BREAM HOST OF \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" AHEAD OF THE BIG SHOW THIS WEEKEND. SHANNON, GOOD MORNING. WHERE DO YOU SEE THIS ALL GOING?  WE KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN ATTEMPTS AT THE SUPREME COURT LEVEL BY THOSE WHO OPPOSE THIS FORGIVENESS PLAN WHO WANT TO SHUT IT DOWN OR BLOCK IT. THE SUPREME COURT UNDER JUSTICE AMY CONEY BARRETT WENT ON HER BASED ON GEOGRAPHY SAID WE WON'T GET INVOLVED AT THIS POINT. THE LOWER COURTS HAVE BEEN VERY INVOLVED. AT LEAST ONE FEDERAL SIR ACCOUNT APPELLATE COURT THAT PUT THE PLAN ON HOLD. A JUDGE IN TEXAS DID THE SAME THING. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SAYING THEY WILL APPEAL DIRECTLY TO THE SUPREME COURT TO MAKE SURE THE PLAN CAN MOVE FORWARD. WHETHER THEY WANT TO GET INVOLVED ON THAT PART OF THE ISSUE BEFORE THE MERITS OF IT ARE DECIDED WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.  Bill: A COUPLE THINGS. DOES THE COURT HAVE TO TAKE THIS CASE? YOU HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO APPLIED AND THE PROGRAM IS ON HOLD. GO AHEAD. SORRY.  NO, THEY DO NOT HAVE TO TAKE ANYTHING THAT COMES BEFORE THEM. THAT'S WHAT JUSTICE BARRETT HAS DONE TWICE TO SAY WE AREN'T GETTING INVOLVED AND TURNING IT AWAY FOR NOW. SO THEY HAVE ALL THE PREROGATIVE IN THE WORLD. IT TAKES FOUR OF THE JUSTICES TO START TO GET INVOLVED AND EVENTUALLY GET IT ONTO THEIR CALENDAR. WHEN THE EMERGENCY APPEALS COME IN IT'S A 6-3 VOTE. MAJORITY VOTE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL GET INVOLVED IN KEEPING THESE PROGRAMS RUNNING. IN THE MEANTIME THERE IS JUST TONS OF LITIGATION ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS AS IT WOULD BE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FORGIVENESS.  Bill: I DON'T REMEMBER ALL THE NUMBERS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD HERE BUT I THINK THERE WERE LIKE 36 MILLION OUTSTANDING LOANS AND THERE HAD ALREADY BEEN 20 MILLION WHO HAD APPLIED ONLINE. IT WAS THAT FAST. THEY WERE GOING FOR IT. NOW IT COULD BE ON HOLD FOR HOW LONG WE DON'T KNOW. BUT THE POWER OF THE PURSE IS DETERMINED BY CONGRESS AND THIS WAS AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT THE PRESIDENT ISSUED. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE.  IT IS. THE ENTIRE ISSUE. THE SUPREME COURT HAS WEIGHED IN A NUMBER OF TIMES ON THE USE OF EXECUTIVE POWER AND PUSHED BACK AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT OBAMA. THIS IS SOMETHING THEY REGULARLY DO. THIS FEDERAL JUDGE IN TEXAS WHO PUT THE THING ON HOLD SAID WE AREN'T RULED BY AN EXECUTIVE WITH A PEN. THERE ARE SEPARATION OF POWERS ISSUES AND SEPARATE BRANCHES THAT HANDLE THINGS. THIS IS FUNDAMENTAL TO RESPECTING THE CONSTITUTIONAL INTEGRITY AS PUT TOGETHER BY THE FOUNDERS OF THIS COUNTRY AND THAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO SIMPLY GO AND SAY WE'RE GOING TO CANCEL THIS DEBT FOR EVERYBODY. WE KNOW IT GETS PAID OFF SOMEWHERE. DOESN'T TRICKLE INTO THIN AIR. THIS JUDGE SAID YOU CAN'T DO IT. THAT'S THE ENTIRE ARGUMENT. CAN THE PRESIDENT GO THIS FAR?  Sandra: UNDER SECRETARY OF EDUCATION SAID IN A COURT FILING THIS. THESE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS HAD THE REASONABLE EXPECTATION AND BELIEF THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO MAKE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS ON THE FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN. THIS BELIEF MAY WELL STOP THEM FROM MAKING PAYMENTS EVEN IF THE DEPARTMENT IS PREVENTED FROM GIVING DEBT RELIEF UNLESS THE DEPARTMENT IS ALLOWED TO PROVIDE ONE-TIME DEBT RELIEF. HIGHER LOAN DEFAULT RATES DUE TO THE ONGOING CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT THEY OWE. SO MAKE SENSE OF THAT FOR US, SHANNON.  SO IF THEY ARE GOING TO SAY IT IS ABOUT POTENTIAL CONFUSION BECAUSE THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH DECIDED TO WAIVE ALL THIS YOU CAN APPLY IT TO A MILLION DIFFERENT THINGS. THE CDC TRIED TO BAN THE RENT EVICTIONS AND SAID NO YOU CAN LIVE WHERE YOU LIVE AND NOT GET EVICTED AND NOBODY CAN MAKE YOU PAY RENT. THE SUPREME COURT SAID NO, THIS ISN'T SOMETHING A FEDERAL AGENCY CAN DECIDE ON ITS OWN. IF SO THEY COULD JUST SWIPE A PEN OVER ALL KINDS OF THINGS AND PEOPLE COULD COMPLAIN AND CLAIM THEY WERE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT THEIR RIGHTS WERE. IT IS UNDER LEGAL CONSIDERATION AT THIS POINT ON A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT LEVELS. MAYBE AT THE SUPREME COURT. YOU CAN'T SIMPLY SAY YOU WERE CONFUSED AS THE ARGUMENT FOR ALLOWING THE PROGRAM THAT MAYBE ILLEGAL TO MOVE FORWARD.  Bill: YEAH. THERE IS AN ANSWER THERE SOMEWHERE. SHANNON, TOM COTTON THIS WEEKEND. WHAT'S COMING UP?  HE WILL TALK TO US. HE SAID IF YOU HAVE TIKTOK DELETE IT AND GET A NEW PHONE. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY. ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE TICKETMASTER TAYLOR SWIFT FIASCO. CALLS IN WASHINGTON TO BREAK UP THE MONOPOLY. BRIT HUME AND PETER DOOCY WILL JOIN US TO TALK ABOUT HIS UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN.  Bill: LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. THROW THE PHONE AWAY NOT JUST DELETE THE APP.  GET A NEW ONE.  Sandra: OH MAN.  Bill: THANK YOU, WE'LL SEE YOU ON SUNDAY. NOW A FUGITIVE CALIFORNIA COUPLE IS BACK IN CUSTODY A YEAR AFTER BEING CONVICTED FOR STEALING $20 MILLION IN COVID RELIEF FUNDS. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SAYING THAT COUPLE USED DOZENS OF FAKE OR STOLEN IDENTITIES TO APPLY FOR 150 LOANS, SPENDING THE MONEY ON HOMES, JEWELRY, HANDBAGS AND HARLEY DAVIDSON MOTORCYCLE. THEY FLED FROM THE UNITED STATES IN JUNE. BOTH WILL APPEAR IN FEDERAL COURT THIS AFTERNOON. IT MIGHT BE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.  Sandra: THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. THE FENTANYL POISONING OF AMERICA DEVASTATING SO MANY FAMILIES. WE WILL SPEAK WITH A WOMAN WHO IS NOW RAISING HER GRANDCHILDREN AFTER HER OWN DAUGHTER DIED OF A FENTANYL OVERDOSE. BUT FIRST AMERICA'S FARMERS WARNING THEIR INDUSTRY IS UNDER THREAT. MADISON IS LIVE IN A NEW JERSEY FARM FOR US. HELLO, MADISON.  YEAH, FARMERS ARE TELLING ME OUR CURRENT ENERGY POLICY AND LABOR POLICIES ARE THREATENING AGRICULTURE HERE IN THE U.S. THIS ALL PLAYING INTO A LARGER SHIFT THAT WE COULD SEE WITH EXPORTS THAT WOULD HAVE SWEEPING IMPACTS ON OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. I WILL BREAK IT ALL DOWN AFTER THIS. 20221118153949.585|20221118154432.567",

        "trs": " Sean: THIS IS A FOX NEWS ALERT AS WE GO NOW TO IDAHO TONIGHT WHERE POLICE THERE ARE REPORTEDLY SEARCHING FOR A RAMBO-STYLE KNIFE IN THE ONGOING INVESTIGATION IN THE TRAGIC MURDER OF FOUR UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO STUDENTS.  THE FBI TELLS FOX NEWS AN ELITE BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS UNIT JOINED LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE INVESTIGATION AND THE MANNER OF DEATH FOR ALL WAS STABBING ACCORDING TO THE CORONER AND THE CAUSE OF DEATH WAS MURDER AND THIS WAS NOT A MURDER SUICIDE. THE FOUR STUDENTS WERE LIKELY STABBED WITH THE SAME WEAPON. TONIGHT POLICE SAY THEY STILL DO NOT HAVE A SUSPECT OR THAT MURDER WEAPON. FOR DAYS POLICE INITIALLY SAID THIS WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENTS BUT NOW MOST STUDENTS HAVE FLED THE CAMPUS AS POLICE CAN'T ASSURE THERE'S NOT A THREAT. THE FOUR STUDENTS, ALL 21 OR YOUNGER WERE BELIEVED TO BE FRIENDS. NEW SURVEILLANCE VIDEO SHOWS TWO OF THE MURDER VICTIMS AT A FOOD TRUCK ABOUT TWO HOURS BEFORE POLICE THINK THE TWO YOUNG WOMEN WERE KILLED. ON SUNDAY POLICE WERE CALL TO DO THE STUDENT'S HOME ABOUT UNRESPONSIVE PERSON AND THE BODIES WERE DISCOVERED AND THERE WERE TWO OTHER ROOMMATES IN THE HOUSE DURING THESE VIOLENT MURDERSES. VIDEO APPEARS TO SHOW BLOOD ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOME. NOW JUST DAYS BEFORE THANKSGIVING, THESE FAMILIES ARE MOURNING AND THIS COMMUNITY IS ON EDGE AS A KILLER OR KILLERS ARE ON THE LOOSE. SEAN.  Sean: MATT FINN, THANK YOU. CHRIS RAY WAS THRILLED ON CAPITOL HILL AND WAS ASKED A SIMPLE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER FINDING OUT ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP OR THIS RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION. HERE'S HOW THE FBI DIRECTOR RESPONDED. TAKE A LISTEN.  HAVE YOU READ SENATOR GRASSLEY'S AND MY REPORT ON HUNTER BIDEN'S CORRUPTION ISSUED IN SEPTEMBER OF 2020 AND NOVEMBER OF 2020. HAVE YOU READ THOSE REPORTS?  I HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT IT.  DO YOU SEE ANY SIGN OF RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION IN THOSE REPORTS?  THAT WOULD BE A HARD QUESTION FOR ME TO ANSWER.  NO, IT'S VERY EASY. IT'S VERY EASE REIGNSY TO ANSWE. THERE'S NO RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION. THAT REPORT IS COMPLETELY CLEAN OF ANY INTERFERENCE OF FOREIGN INFLUENCE. ALL THOUGH WE HAVE BEEN FALSELY ACCUSED INCLUDING BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE OF SPREADING RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION.  Sean: ASK YOURSELF, WHY IS CHRIS WRAY SO UNWILLING TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT IS SO OBVIOUS TO EVERYBODY ELSE THAT IN FACT THE HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP HAD ZERO TO DO WITH RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION. IT IS LONG PAST DUE FOR WRAY TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE ROT INSIDE THE FBI LEADERSHIP. RECENTLY REELECTED SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN, RON JOHNSON. FIRST, LET ME CONGRATULATE YOU AND YOU WERE ACCURATE WITH THE AUDIENCE SAYING YOU HAD A TOUGH RACE. YOU HAD ABOUT $100 MILLION IN ASSETS DUMPED ON YOUR HANDS AND YOUR WORK IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. LET ME ASK THIS, THERE'S GOING TO BE AS MANY AS 20+ FBI WHISTLE BLOWERS AND THEY'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE FBI HAS BEEN POLITICIZED AND WE NOW KNOW IN OCTOBER OF 2016, THEY OFFERED CHRISTOPHER STEELE $1 MILLION IF HE COULD CORROBORATE THE DOSSIER AND THE BULK OF THE INFORMATION AND THEY SAID THAT IN FACT THEY HAD AFFIRM IT HAD TO BE TRUE THAT THEY VERIFIED IT. WHAT IS GOING ON INSIDE THE FBI? HOW DEEP IS THIS POLITICAL BIAS WITHIN THE FBI?  SEAN, DIRECTOR WRAY WAS DIRECTOR IN 2017 AND UNDER HIS WATCH THE INTEL COMMITTEE SAID THE STEELE DOSSIER WAS TAINTED WITH RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION. UNDER HIS WATCH, THE FBI OBTAINED HUNTEDDER BIDEN'S LAP -- HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP IN 2017 AND DID NOTHING WITH IT. UNDER HIS WATCH ACCORDING TO WHISTLE BLOWERS, THEY DEVELOP ADD SCHEME IN AUGUST OF 2020 TO DOWN PLAY THE DEROGATORY INFORMATION TO DEEP 60 INVESTIGATION. UNDER HIS WATCH AND THAT SAME MONTH, THEY PROVIDED AN UNSO LISTED BRIEFING TO SENATOR GRASSLEY AND MYSELF AND IT WAS A NOTHING BRIEFING. I KNEW IT WAS A SET UP AND IT WAS A SET UP BECAUSE NINE MONTHS LATER AND LEAKED IT TO THE WASHINGTON POST TO SMEAR ME AND THEREFORE INTERFERE IN THE 2022 WISCONSIN U.S. SENATE ELECTION. THEY INTERFERED IN THE U.S. 2020 ELECTION. HIS PRIMARY JOB AS NEW DIRECTOR WAS TO CLEAN UP AND RESTORE INTEGRITY AND CREDIBILITY IN THE FBI AND FAILED MISERABLY AND I DON'T BELIEVE A WORD HE SAYS AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.  Sean: WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE FBI, WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IF THEY USE AN UNVERIFIABLE DOSSIER THAT HILLARY CLINTON PAID FOR AND THEY SAY IT'S VERIFIED AND THEY SAY TO A WARRANT AND IS THE FBI POLITICIZED ON THE ISSUE OF HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP AND THE ISSUE OF PARENTS SPEAKING OUT AT SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS AND INVESTIGATING THEM AS DOMESTIC TERRORISTS, IS ALL OF THIS NOW MUCH BIGGER THAN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THOUGHT AND HOW MANY WHISTLE BLOWERS ARE WE LIKELY TO HEAR FROM?  I HOPE A WHOLE LOT MORE. SO PLEASE GO TO WHI WHISTLEBLOWER@RONJOHNSON.GOV AND WE NEED TO FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW POLITICIZED AND PARTISAN THE FBI.S THIS IS OUT OF CONTROL. WE HAVE THE CORRUPTION OF THE BIDEN FAMILY COMPROMISING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY, BUT WE HAVE PARTISANSHIP AND THE POLITICIZATION AND WEAPONIZATION OF THE FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TOGETHER WITH THE HEALTH AGENCIES AND WE NEED WHISTLE BLOWERS IN AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVING THE TRUTH. WHISTLEBLOWERS@RONJOHNSON.GOV. COME FORWARD AND TELL US THE TRUTH.  Sean: THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP AFTER REPUBLICANS REGAIN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. FAR LEFT PROGRESSIVE HAKEE AMERICAS JEFFREYS BELIEVED TO BE THE FRONT RUNNER REPLACING PELOSI IN LEADERSHIP AND JEFFREYS IS A FIVE TERM NEW YORK AND THE ONE THING THAT'S CHANGED WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THEY'VE USED A HIGH REAL AGENDA AND WOULD PRETEND TO BE MORE MODERATE AND HELD THESE RADICAL NEWS AND IT'S BEEN TRANSPARENT AND IF IN FACT HE BUB BECOMES THE NEXT SPEAKER. HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THAT?  IT'S A GREAT DAY THAT NANCY PELOSI WON'T HAVE A GAVEL. SHE WAS TENACIOUS AND NOBODY CAN DOUBT HOW SHE RULED THE HOUSE AND THE DEMOCRATS FOR SO LONG. THIS IS AS FAR LEFT RADICAL PROGRESSIVE AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY HAVE. THERE'S NO ROOM FOR THE OLD SO-CALLED BLUE DOG DEMOCRATS THAT YOU CAN WORK WITH. THEY CARED ABOUT FISCAL DISCIPLINE OR CRIME OR SOME OF THE OTHER KEY ISSUES. NOT TODAY'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR A MODERATE IN THEIR GROUP.  SERGELY SEEMS LIKE THAT.  Sean: NOW THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THE MAJORITY AND IT'S TWO BIG WEAPONS THEY HAVE. ONE IS THE POWER TO SUBPOENA, WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THAT TONIGHT. THERE WILL BE INVESTIGATIONS INTO WHETHER OR NOT THE FBI IS ABUSING POWER AND DOJ IS INVESTIGATING AND INVESTIGATION INTO HUNTER BIDE AND JOE BIDEN AND HIS RELATIONSHIP ON THESE DEALS. THE ORIGINS OF COVID-19. THEN THE OTHER ONE HAS THE POWER OF THE PURSE. HOW WOULD YOU ADVICE THE REPUBLICANS WITH THEIR NEW MAJORITY WITH THINGS TO MAKE AMERICA BETTER AND THOSE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED.  I SEE JUST LIKE YOU DO, SEAN, THERE ARE REALLY THREE KEY ISSUES AND THE POWER OF THE PURSE, I DON'T KNOW THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THE DISCIPLINE TO DO THAT. THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO IT SO FAR AND THAT WILL BE THEIR BIGGEST CHALLENGE, PARTICULARLY WITH A SMALL MARGIN BUT I WANT TO SEE A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT EQUALLY GOES AFTER THE DEMOCRATS WHEN YOU ISSUE A SUBPOENA, MY FORMER COLLEAGUE LIKES TO SAY YOUR SUBPOENA, WHICH I CAN SIGN UNILATERALLY AND JAMES COMER WILL SIGN AND JAMES JORDAN AND HOW DELAWARE TENACIOUS IS THE DEPARTMENT OF JJUSTICE IN ENFORFORCING THAT AD THAT'LL TAKE CARE FOR A MATTER OF DAYS ANDS CRIMINAL REFERRALS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DOING NOTHING AND HOW DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ENFORCE THOSE SUBPOENAS AND WILL THEY GO OUT AND PROSECUTE SOMEBODY AND I HAVE SEEN ZERO EVIDENCE THAT IT IS AN EQUAL AND BALANCED PLAYING FIELD THAT AGAIN AS TREY GOUDI LIKED TO SAY, THEY NEVER SAW AN INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT THAT A REPUBLICAN INITIATED IT TO BE JUSTIFIED AND THEY NEVER THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A DEMOCRAT INVESTIGATION THEY THOUGHT SHOULD EVER END. THAT'S HOW THE NATIONAL MEDIA TREATS THESE THINGS AND THAT'S WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN AND HAS TO DO IT EQUALLY NOW.  Sean: SO MIKE LEE HAD A BIG WIN IN HIS REELECTION CAMPAIGN OUT THERE. 28 OUT OF -- 48 OUT OF HIS 49 REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES SUPPORTED HIM. ONLY ONE REPUBLICAN SENATOR DID NOT. HE'S FROM YOUR HOME STATE OF UTAH AND I BELIEVE HE'S UP FOR REELECTION IN TWO YEARS IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. WILL YOU, JASON CHAFFETZ, CONSIDER A PRIMARY AGAINST MITT ROMNEY?  LOOK AT THE TIME HERE, SEAN. WE'RE GETTING KIND OF LATE ON THE SHOW HERE, BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M ACTIVELY OR TECH ATHLETICS NATIONALLY LOOKING AT. IT'S MAYBE THE BOX AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FRIEND. FRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS RUN FOR CONGRESS. WE'LL SEE. WE'LL SEE.  Sean: THERE'S SOME TRUTH TO IT. IT WILL NOT BE THE LAST TIME I ASK THE QUESTION. I CAN PROMISE YOU. YOU'RE GOING TO END UP HATING ME BY THE TIME THE NEXT TWO YEARS IS OVER.  THAT I DO BELIEVE. I AGREE WITH THAT.  Sean: THANK YOU, SIR. JASON CHAFFETZ, THANK YOU. WE'RE THREE WEEKS AWAY FROM ALL CRITICAL RUNOFF IN THE GREAT STATE OF GEORGIA. RAPHAEL WARNOCK CAN BARELY ATTRACT A CROWD AND TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR SCREEN. HIS RALLY GOT A WHOPPING 15 PEOPLE. OF COURSE DEMOCRATS ARE STILL UP TO THEIR SAME DIRTY TRICKS AND THEY WANT THEM TO REWRITE GEORGIA'S ELECTION LAWS BEFORE THE RUNOFF ASKING A GEORGIA JUDGE TO OVERRULE CURRENT STATE LAW TO ALLOW EARLY VOTING THE SATURDAY AFTER THANKSGIVING. IT'S AN OBVIOUS EFFORT TO TRY AND USE AN ACTIVIST JUDGE TO OVERRULE A CURRENT LAW TO HELP WARNOCK WHO IS AS VULNERABLE AS EVER. REACTION FROM THE GEORGIA SENATE OF HERSCHEL WALKER.  I'M NOT GOING TO LOSE THIS ONE AND THEY'RE GOING TO THINK THAT GEORGIA IS FOR SALE AND WE NEED TO WIN THE GREAT SENATE SEAT BACK FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE OF GEORGIA AND TALKS ABOUT WE THE PEOPLE, NOT WE THE PEOPLE. AND SENATOR WARNOCK WANTS TO THINK OF GOVERNMENT, I DON'T. WE WANT TO WIN FOR THE GREAT PEOPLE OF GEORGIA.  Sean: HERSCHEL, YOU'VE GOT TO TELL LINDSEY THAT YOU WERE PRETTY IMPRESS WHEN HAD WE DID PUSHUPS IN MY RADIO STUDIO TOGETHER. I THINK YOU GOT TO WORK ON LINDSEY. I'M NOT SURE IF HE CAN DO 10 OR 20 AT THIS POINT. WE'VE GOT TO WORK ON HIM. I DON'T DO AS MANY AS YOU BUT CLOSER THAN 10.  IF YOU WILL GIVE TEAMHERSCHEL.COM, RIGHT NOW TONIGHT, I WILL DO 50 PUSH UPS ON YOUR SHOW, BUT YOU GOT TO GIVE NOW.  I'LL MAKE SURE HE DOES THE 50 PUSHUPS.  Sean: I WANT TO KNOW, ARE THEY 50 CONSECUTIVE PUSHUPS OR ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE A BREAK?  THEY WILL BE DONE IN THE SAME DAY I START. BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WARNOCK SAID TODAY, HE SAID THE GOVERNO. YOU DO LISTEN TO THE ANSWER; RIGHT. HERE'S WHAT WARNOCK SAID TODAY, IF YOU GO TO THE SENATE AND ACTUALLY HAVE TO KNOW STUFF. THIS IS THE MAN, WARNOCK, WHO KNOWS THIS. HE SUPPORTS ABORTION ON DEMAND, TAXPAYER FUNDED UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. HERSCHEL KNOWS THAT WRONG. WARNOCK IS DOING NOTHING. 5,000 AMERICAN SOLDIERS ARE GOING TO BE DISCHARGED IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS BECAUSE THEY REFUSE A COVID VACCINE. THEY'RE WILLING TO GET SHOT FOR THE COUNTRY BUT DON'T WANT TO TAKE A SHOT. 4 MILLION ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS HAVE COME ACROSS THE BORDER UNVACCINATED AND THEY GET A FREE TRIP ALL OVER AMERICA. HERSCHEL KNOWS THAT'S WRONG. HER HERSCHEL KNOWS IT'S STUPID O BEG PEOPLE TO BRUCE OIL OVERSEAS THAT HATES YOUR GUTS AND STUPID NOT TO FIND IT HERE AT HOME. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT HERSCHEL WALKER REPRESENTS YOUR WAY OF THINKING, YOU BETTER DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW. GO TO TEAMHERSCHEL.COM. WARNOCK CAN'T GET 15 PEOPLE TO COME TO A RALLY BUT THEY HIRED THE DEMOCRATS. 900 PEOPLE A DAY TO COME INTO GEORGIA, KNOCK ON DOORS AND THEY'RE THROWING EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK AND HE LOST THE FIRST TIME. HE SHOULD LOSE THE SECOND TIME AND I'M PROUD OF HERSCHEL AND IT'S MASSIVE. CLOSE THE GAP BY GOING TO TEAMHERSCHEL.COM TO GET OUT THE VOTE F. YOU'RE AN INCUMBENT, SEAN, AND DON'T WIN THE FIRST TIME AROUND AND FIND YOURSELF IN A RUNOFF, YOU'RE IN TROUBLE. LET'S CLOSE THE DEAL, TEAMHERSCHEL.COM. IF YOU CAN'T GIVE ONLINE, GO TO THE MAILBOX. WE HAVE A PO BOX AND SEND A CHECK. I KEEP SAYING FOR A REASON. IF HE HAS THE RESOURCES, HE CAN PROVE TO THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA, WARNOCK IS A FRAUD AND ONE OF THE MOST LIBERAL SENATORS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND DOESN'T REPRESENT THE VALUES OF GEORGIA. I'M FROM SOUTH CAROLINA, WARNOCK CANCELS OUT MY VOTE AND I WANT A CONSERVATIVE THIS YEAR FOR CHRISTMAS IS FOR HERSCHEL TO WIN.  Sean: WE APPRECIATE IT, LINDSEY GRAHAM. WE'LL SEE YOU FOR A TOWN HALL AND WE'LL TELL EVERYBODY THE DETAILS IN THE COMING DAYS. THANK YOU, BOTH. BIDEN CAUGHT EMBARRASSING HIMSELF ON THE WORLD STAGE YET AGAIN. SHOW YOU WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME WE'LL CHECK IN WITH LJ AND LAWRENCE JONES, CARLY SHIMKISS AND AIN AIN AINSLEY EARHART. WE'RE ALL LIVE FROM THE PATRIOT AWARDS.  WE'RE LIVE FROM FLORIDA WITH  Sean: ALL RIGHT, NOW AT THE G20 THIS WEEK, BIDEN ONCE AGAIN NEEDED HELP FROM HIS TEAM TELLING HIM WHERE TO CIRCUITS WHERE TO STAND -- SIT, STAND, POSE FOR PHOTOS AND THEY GAVE BIDEN VERY SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS LIKE YOU WILL SIT AT THE CENTER. YOU WILL DELIVER OPENING REMARKS, FIVE MINUTES. YOU'LL CLOSE THE EVENT ALONGSIDE YOUR COHOST. JOEY, WHY DO YOU NEED INSTRUCTIONS TELLING YOU WHERE TO SIT? ANYWAY, HERE WITH REACTION IS OUR FRIEND, COLLEAGUE, LJ, LAWRENCE JONES. WELCOME TO LAWRENCE. [ CHEERING ].  Sean: AINSLEY AER EARHART IS WITH US, THE COHOST OF \"FOX & FRIENDS\". MY BOOK, I'M SO GLAD YOU WERE BORN, FIVE WEEKS IN A ROW NO. 1 NEW YORK TYPES BEST SELLER. CARLY SHIMKIS ALSO ON \"FOX & FRIENDS\". GOOD TO SEE YOU.  CAN I SAY, WE HAVE TO GET UP FOR \"FOX & FRIENDS\" IN THE MORNING AND YOUR SHOW IS THE ONLY SHOW WE'LL DO THIS LATE. IF IT WAS ANYBODY ELSE, IT'S A NO.  Sean: YOU'RE STEALING MY LINES. YOU'RE THE ONLY GUYS THAT CAN GET ME TO WORK ON SATURDAY.  THAT'S TOO . WE'RE ON YOUR SHOW TONIGHT AND IN RETURN YOU'RE ON OUR SHOW.  Sean: YEAH, WHAT TIME CAN YOU DO IT? I SAID THE LATEST POSSIBLE.  WHAT TIME? 8:30?  8:30.  WHEN THEY ASKED ME TO DO THIS, WHICH IS ALWAYS AN HONOR TO BE AN HONTY, CAN YOU BELIEVE -- HANNITY, CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? HE DOES GO ON \"FOX & FRIENDS\" SO I'LL DO IT.  Sean: ONE THING I WILL SAY, IS IT EMBARRASSING THAT WE HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT COUNTRY HE'S IN OR THE NAME OF WORLD LEADERS.  YOU USE THE WORD EMBARRASSMENT, I USE THE WORD PREDICTABLE. IF YOU REMEMBER, SEAN, DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, HOW MANY NIGHTS DID YOU SEE ME IN DELAWARE IN THE BASEMENT TO BE OUTSIDE AND JOE BIDEN, WILL YOU COME OUT AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS? THERE WAS A CONCEALED LIST DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. WE KNOW WHAT WE WERE GETTING. I THINK AMERICA WILL CHOOSE DIFFERENTLY. 75% OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC SAID WE'RE HEAD DOWN THE WRONG DIRECTION. THERE'S A LOT OF BUYERS REMORSE FROM THE AMERICAN PUBLIC.  SO I ASKED SOME OF THE FOLKS WHAT THEY THOUGHT. I SAID WE'LL BE ON TALKING ABOUT THIS AND SHALL MY LITTLE FOCUS GROUP. I'M THE DOCTOR AND I WOULD SAY HE HAS SERIOUS ISSUES. IT'S NOT NECESSARY, HE DOESN'T NEED A STEP BY STEP INSTRUCTION AS TO WHAT TO DO. MAKES OUR COUNTRY LOOK VERY WEAK ON THE NATIONAL STAGE AND NOT CAPABLE OF DOING HIS DUTIES, EMBARRASSING.  THAT IS EMBARRASSING. AND I WOULD JUST SAY IF THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR THE CEO OF A COMPANY, IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE FOR THE CEO OF A COUNTRY TO BEHAVE LIKE THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THE NOTES BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE AT THESE BIG AFFAIR ASKS YOU NEED SOME SORT OF INSTRUCTION LIKE YOU SIT, YOU STAND, YOU SPEAK. COME ON.  I'M SORRY. IT DOESN'T -- I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, YEAH. IT SAYS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE OPENING REMARKS AND WE'VE DONE A MILLION PUBLIC EVENTS SAYING THIS IS YOUR OPENING REMARKS. BUT WHEN HE HAS TO LOOK DOWN AT HIS PAPER SAYING WE STAND TOGETHER WITH UKRAINE AND THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. COME ON.  YOU KNOW, SEAN, IT MAKES ME GO TO -- IF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ALL AGREES PRETTY MUCH THAT WE'RE HEADING DOWN THE WRONG DIRECTION, MY ONLY ADVICE TO THE REPUBLICANS IS YOU NOT ONLY HAVE TO CRAFT A MESSAGE BUT HAVE TO HAVE THE GROUND GAME. PART OF THE REASON DWI DONALD TRUMP WAS SUCCESSFUL DURING HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN IS BECAUSE HE HAD THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND CONNECTED WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THERE HAS TO BE A TIME WHEN WE STOP ENDORSING BAD CANDIDATES IN THE SENSE OF NOT FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT BUT IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO DO THE WORK, WE CAN'T SUPPORT YOU.  Sean: HIDING IN THE BASEMENT WORKED FOR BIDEN. HIDING IN THE BASEMENT WORKED FOR FETTERMAN. THE MEDIA IS COMPLIES SIT AND GO ALONG WITH IT.  SOME OF THEM WEREN'T WILLING TO HAVE DEBATES. LOOK AT KARI LAKE'S OPPONENT, SHE NEVER DEBATED HER AND WON.  BIDEN'S 80TH BIRTHDAY IN THREE DAIS. I BELIEVE IT'S ON SUNDAY AND IT'LL BE A VERY SMALL CELEBRATION. NOT GOING TO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IT. THESE NOTES KEEP COMING UP AND WE'VE SEEN IT BEFORE. THE EASTER BUNNY MOMENT YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO. THIS IS LIKE REPEAT BEHAVIOR ON THE PRESIDENT'S FRONT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MAJORITY OF DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT HIM TO RUN FOR OFFICE AGAIN EITHER.  Sean: THANK YOU FOR STAYING UP LATE. ARE YOU ON \"FOX & FRIENDS\" TOMORROW TOO?  YEAH.  Sean: WE'RE ALL BACK TOGETHER.  ONLY REASON I'M HERE TONIGHT.  WE'RE ALL TOGETHER TOMORROW.  Sean: EXACTLY. ANYWAY, WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE AT THE PATRIOT AWARDS AND HONORING REAL HEROS IN THIS COUNTRY AND WHAT AN AMAZING EVENT. IF YOU GET A CHANCE, WATCH IT ON FOXNATION.COM.  THE BEST TELEVISION SHOW IS HANNITY! [ CHEERING ].  Sean: LET'S GIVE IT UP FOR THESE GUYS. THERE YOU GO. WHEN WE COME BACK, THE ONE AND ONLY LAURA INGRAM JOINING US RIGHT HERE FOR A REAL LIFE HANDOFF TONIGHT AS WE CONTINUE FROM THE PATRIOT AWARDS. \u266a \u266a  Sean: JOINING US NOW IS THE HOST OF \"THE INGRAHAM ANGLE,\" LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LAURA INGRAHAM!

THE ADMINISTRATION'S CONTINUED FAILURES ON THE BORDER PLACES ARIZONA COMMUNITIES AND OUR NATION SECURITY AT RISK.  WE CAN'T FIX THE PROBLEM UNLESS WE ACKNOWLEDGE IT.  THE FLOW OF DRUGS ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST BORDER IS UNRELENTING.

MAYORKAS OFFERING NO NEW SOLUTIONS TODAY, INSTEAD STICKING WITH A 6 POINT PLAN, DHS UNVEILED IN THE SPRING. AND, YET, THE AGENCY TRACT A RECORD 2.38 MILLION MIGRANT ENCOUNTERS IN THE ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR.  THE PLAN IS WORKING AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER? [CHANTING]  BORDER SECURITY WASN'T THE ONLY CONCERN AT THE HEARING. FBI DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY CONFIRMING SINCE THE DOBBS DECISION, WHICH OVERTURNED ROE V. WADE, AND SENT THE RIGHT TO AN ABORTION BACK TO THE STATES, A STUNNING 70% OF ABORTION-RELATED VIOLENCE CASES WERE AGAINST PRO-LIFE ORGANIZATIONS.  WE'RE GOING AFTER THAT THROUGH OUR JOINT TERRORISM TASK FORCE SO WE TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY.

THE FDA CONTINUES AS BOTH THE SENATE AND HOUSE ANNOUNCED HEARINGS SET FOR MONTH IN MONTH AND NOW A COURT FILING FROM THE NEW FTXCEO UNVEILING SPECIFICS OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING BEHIND THE SCENES. NOT ONLY PERSONAL FUNDS USED TO PURCHASE REAL ESTATE IN THE BAHAMAS THE $32 BILLION COMPANY HAD NO BOARD MEETINGS OR SUBSTANTIATE DYED BOOKKEEPING SYSTEM. THE NEW CEO ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR CLEANING UP THE ENRON SCANDAL SHARING, QUOTE:  NEVER, IN MY CAREER HAVE, I SEEN SUCH A COMPLETE FAILURE OF CORPORATE CONTROL. THE CONCENTRATION OF CONTROL IN THE HANDS OF A VERY SMALL GROUP OF INEXPERIENCED, UNSOPHISTICATED AND POTENTIALLY COMPROMISED INDIVIDUALS, THIS SITUATION IS UNPRECEDENTED. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ARE BEING RAISED ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR MEETING OF THAT TEAM CAROLINE ELLISON. RUMORED BANKMAN-FRIED'S EX-GIRLFRIEND. WHILE ELLISON IS BEING ACCUSED OF LOSING CUSTOMER FUNDS A INTERVIEW SHEDS LIGHT ON HER PHILOSOPHY SURROUNDING RISKS.  I THINK LIKE BEING COMFORTABLE WITH RISK IS VERY IMPORTANT.

A LOT OF PEOPLE VERY SMART BUT AREN'T GOOD AT NECESSARILY THE VERY LIKE MESSY WORLD OF TRADING, ESPECIALLY CRYPTO TRADING.  AND YOU MAY RECALL THAT SAM BANKMAN-FRIED WAS A MEGA DONOR THIS PAST ELECTION CYCLE BUT ALSO LEARNING MORE ABOUT HIS FAMILY AND THEIR TIES TO DEMOCRATS.

        "trs": "\u266a \u266a  Kayleigh: RIGHT NOW AND CAPITOL HILL AT DHS SECRETARY ELLA HUNTER AMERICA'S TESTIFYING FOR THE HOMELAND SECURITY ON THE CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. IT IS GOING TO GET WORSE. A FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKED TITLE 42, A POLICY OF EXPULSION OF MIGRANTS ACROSS THE BORDER ILLEGALLY. THE JUDGE HAS GIVEN ADMINISTRATION FIVE WEEKS TO PREPARE FOR WHAT SOME FEAR WILL BE A MASSIVE RUSH AT THE BORDER. BUT ACCORDING TO SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER, THAT MAY BE A GOOD THING.  WE ARE SHORT OF WORKERS. WE HAVE A POPULATION THAT IS NOT REPRODUCING ON ITS OWN WITH THE SAME LEVEL THAT IT USED TO. THE ONLY WAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A GREAT FUTURE IN AMERICA IS IF WE WELCOME AND EMBRACE MIGRANTS AND GET A PATH OF CITIZEN VISION AND 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED THERE ARE.  Kayleigh: EMILY IF WE HAVE REPRODUCTION PROBLEM IN THE UNITED STATES, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK TO ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ WHO SAID, \"THERE ARE SCIENTIFIC THAT THE LIVES OF CHILDREN WILL BE DIFFICULT AND IT LEAVES YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE A LEGITIMATE QUESTION, IS IT OKAY TO HAVE CHILDREN? SO MAYBE HAVE A CHAT WITH HER.  Emily: WITHIN THEIR OWN PARTY, CERTAINLY MANY VOCAL ADVOCATES THAT SAY THE ONLY WAY TO PRESENT THE EXIT CENTRAL CLIMATE CHANGE IS TO STOP HAVING CHILDREN. SO THEY SHOULD CHECK THEIR TALKING POINTS AMONG EACH OTHER. IN THE SAME BREATH, IT REALLY AGGRAVATED HIM HOW THE REPUBLICANS HAVE ANTI-IMMIGRANT MESSAGE. THAT GOES BACK TO DIVISIVENESS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, THAT IS THE FURTHEST THING FROM THE REPUBLICANS TO ADVOCATE FOR A SECURE BORDER. AN SECRETARY ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS, A SECURE BORDER, IN REALITY AMERICANS REGARDLESS OF PARTY ARE STRUGGLING BECAUSE OF THE FENTANYL OVERLOADS, FENTANYL POISONING AND STRAIN ON THE SUBSYSTEMS SOUTHERN BORDER AND THROUGHOUT. IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT BORDER. SO WE NEED TO REDUCE TO CONCEPTUAL HEAVY ISSUE ANTITHETICAL TO THE TROOP AND CONDESCENDING TO THOSE WHO REPORT EVERYDAY ON THE REALITY OF AMERICANS ARE FACING AND WHY THAT SEARCH IS SO DETRIMENTAL TO MANY OF US INCLUDING THOSE MIGRANTS.  Kayleigh: DR. SAPHIER AFTER TALKING TO AOC HE MAY WANT TO TALK TO CORPORATE MEDIA. WE WANT TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE, TO BREED OR NOT TO BREED, THAT IS THE QUESTION. AND PRINCE HARRY WANTS TO GO KIDS BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SO HE HAS A LONG LIST.  Da Dr. Saphier: MAYBE THAT WILL REDUCE THE HEADLINES AROUND MEGHAN MARKLE. AND IT DECLINED ABOUT 20%, THE BIRTHRATE AND MOSTLY BECAUSE OF THE GREAT RECESSION AT THE TIME BUT THEY NOTED THAT IT HAS NOT PICKED UP AS TIMES HAVE GONE ON. WHY IS IT HAPPENING? WHAT WILL HAPPEN? YOU WILL HAVE A SHRINKING WORKFORCE AND WITH THAT SAID, WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN HAPPEN? YOU HAVE SEEN PEOPLE BE SCARED TO HAVE CHILDREN FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER THINGS. WHAT I FIND INTERESTING TO EMILY'S POINT THE TIMING OF THIS. USE ALL THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE BEGGED FOR AND MAKE THE TITLE 42 BY SAYING, PLEASE GIVE US FIVE MORE WEEKS BECAUSE ALL OF A SUDDEN TITLE 42 AT THE BORDER IS GOING AWAY AND WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE MIGRANTS. IT HAS PROVEN THEY DID NOT HAVE A PLAN WITH PLAN WITH EMIGRATION. THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. THEY HAVE TO TURN THE TALKING POINTS TO THIS BECAUSE THIS PROVES THEIR FAILURE AND SECURING THE BORDER.  Kayleigh: AND DAGEN APPEARING AND KATE BEDINGFIELD, THEY HAVE BEEN PREPARING FIVE WEEKS. TAKE A LISTEN.  WE ARE PLANNING FOR MULTIPLE CONTINGENCIES. WE HAVE EVERY EXPECTATION THAT WHEN THE CDC ULTIMATELY DECIDES IT IS APPROPRIATE TO LIFT TITLE 42 THERE WILL BE AN INFLUX OF PEOPLE TO THE BORDER. SO, WE ARE DOING A LOT OF WORK TO PLAN FOR THAT CONTINGENCY.  Kayleigh: SEVEN MONTHS.  Ben: BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS, WE NEED MORE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE WILL MAYBE STOP THE FLOW OF FENTANYL KILLING OUR AMERICAN CHILDREN AND THE WORKERS THAT YOU ARE SAYING WE SO DESPERATELY NEEDED. IT SHOWS YOU THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT AMERICAN FAMILIES BECAUSE THE ENTIRE TIME, THEY SAID, LET'S OPEN THE BORDER, PLUGGED THE BORDER AND YOU HEARD CHUCK SCHUMER SAY, OR HOWEVER MANY LEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE COUNTRY. AND GET MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS, GIVE THEM CITIZENSHIP, SCREW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE AND THOSE THAT DO WITH THE RIGHT WAY. AND OH, BY THE WAY WE MIGHT KILL UP YOUR KIDS WITH FENTANYL BUT JUST HAVE MORE BABIES AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT WILL BE FINE.  Kayleigh: UNBELIEVABLE!  Dagen: THIS IS GROSS TO SAY THE POPULATION IS NOT REPRODUCING ON ITS OWN WHEN HIS PARTY'S NUMBER ONE PLATFORM ITEM IS ABORTION.  Kayleigh: IT IS AMAZING.  Dagen: ABORTION ACCORDING TO STACEY ABRAMS IS A SOLUTION TO INFLATION. HE USES THIS AS AN EXCUSE. YOU KNOW WHAT, THERE IS NOT GOING TO BE ANY BILL THAT IS A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP AND PATH TO LEGALIZATION. THERE IS NO BIPARTISANSHIP ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE THE BORDER IS WIDE OPEN. AND THE NATION HAS BEEN INUNDATED AND FLOODED WITH ILLEGAL MIGRANTS. THERE WAS NO PATH TO ANYTHING UNTIL THAT GETS FIXED. FOR HIM TO USE THE LACK OF REPRODUCTION AS AN EXCUSE WHEN HE'S THE PARTY OF ABORTION IS VIABLE!  Kayleigh: GREAT POINT AND ABORTION UP TO BIRTH AT THAT.

Charles: FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP LAUNCHING HIS THIRD RUN FOR PRESIDENT DESPITE WARNINGS FROM HIS OWN PARTY TO HOLD OFF. TO MIKE EMANUEL ON WHAT COULD BE A START OF A MESSY REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. MIKE?  GOOD AFTERNOON, CHARLES. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS FIRST TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE'S RUNNING.  THIS CAMPAIGN WILL BE ABOUT ISSUES, VISION AND SUCCESS AND WE WILL NOT STOP. WE WILL NOT QUIT UNTIL WE HAVE ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST GOALS AND MADE OUR COUNTRY GREATER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN BEFORE. WE CAN DO THAT.  NO SURPRISE THE FORMER PRESIDENT CRITICIZED PRESIDENT BIDEN IN WHAT COULD BE A REMATCH OF THE 2020 CAMPAIGN.  JOE BIDEN AND THE RADICAL DEMOCRATS, AMERICA HAS BEEN MOCKED, DERIDED AND BROUGHT TO ITS KNEES PERHAPS LIKE NEVER BEFORE.  PRESIDENT BIDEN'S ALLIES RESPONDED ON TWITTER WITH A VIDEO ARGUING THE FORMER PRESIDENT FAILED AMERICA.  NOBODY HAS EVER DONE WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS.  THEIR ENTIRE ECONOMIC PLAN, TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH.  RECORD BREAKING UNEMPLOYMENT.  THE WORST JOBS REPORT ON RECORD.  IT COULD BE A CROWDED GOP FIELD IN A MESSY PRIMARY SEASON. A LIKELY CANDIDATE WAS ASKED TODAY IF THERE'S A GOP CIVIL WAR.  NO. LOOK, I THINK WE JUST FINISHED THIS ELECTION. OKAY? PEOPLE NEED TO CHILL OUT A LITTLE BIT ON THIS STUFF. SERIOUSLY. WE JUST RAN AN ELECTION.  THERE MAY BE A LITTLE LESS FAMILY INVOLVEMENT IN MR. TRUMP'S THIRD BID. HIS DAUGHTER IVANKA SAYS SHE LOVES AND SUPPORTS HER FATHER BUT DOES NOT PLAN TO BE INVOLVED IN POLITICS THIS TIME. IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S HAD ENOUGH. CHARLES?  Charles: I THINK A FEW PEOPLE MIGHT SIT THIS ONE OUT. PRESIDENT TRUMP ALREADY LOOKING AHEAD TO THE NEXT ELECTION. MANY ARE WONDERING IF HE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT THIS ONE. THE FORMER PRESIDENT BOOSTING 35% OF CANDIDATES AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MID-TERM RACES. SO WILL PRESIDENT TRUMP HAVE A TOUGH TIME SECURING THE GOP NOMINATION? WITH ME NOW, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM KELSIE BOLAR AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST SARAH NORMAN. KELSEY, IT WAS INTERESTING LAST NIGHT WATCHING PRESIDENT TRUMP, THE TONE, YOU CAN CALL IT PRESIDENTIAL, AVOIDING CERTAIN THINGS. HE DIDN'T BRING UP THE ELECTION OF 2020 BEING STOLEN AND HE DIDN'T BRING UP RON DESANTIS. SO HE SEEMED MORE FOCUS FOR SURE. I MEAN, MAYBE HE'S ALREADY LEARNED SOME LESSONS FROM THE MID-TERMS.  PERHAPS. CHARLES, WE ARE TWO YEARS AWAY FROM THIS ELECTION. THE QUESTION IS CAN FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP REMAIN DISCIPLINE THROUGHOUT THAT LONG PRIMARY SEASON. IT'S GOING TO -- EVERY PRIMARY SEASON IS A FIGHT. THIS IS GOING TO BE THAT. TRUMP HAS QUITE A TRACK RECORD OF LAUNCHING SOMETIMES FOUL ATTACKS. WE'LL SEE HOW DISCIPLINED HE IS. OF COURSE, HE WAS MORE DISCIPLINE THAN USUAL LAST NIGHT. BUT IT'S EARLY. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER HIGHLY QUALIFIED POTENTIAL CANDIDATES THAT WILL JUMP IN AND GIVE HIM A TOUGH RUN FOR THIS FIGHT. AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE'RE COMING OFF THE HEELS OF AN U UNIMPRESSIVE ELECTIONS FOR THE GOP AS TRUMP ENDORSED CANDIDATES DIDN'T PERFORM AS WELL AS THEY SHOULD HAVE. VOTERS WILL HOLD TRUMP ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT HE HAS TO BE ABLE TO WIN INDEPENDENTS IN ORDER TO WIN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. I THINK VOTERS WILL BE LOOKING AT WHETHER HE CAN DO THAT.  Charles: FOLKS THAT BELIEVE DEEPLY IN PRESIDENT TRUMP BLAME GOP LEADERSHIP FOR WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MID-TERMS. NOT SUPPORTING CERTAIN CANDIDATES. YOU KNOW, VERY CRITICAL OF THAT. THAT INFIGHT WILLING GO ON. FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PERSPECTIVE WHAT ARE THEY HOPING FOR? WOULD THEY LIKE TO SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP IN THERE OR A BROADER FIELD TO KELSIE'S POINT?  AS A DEMOCRAT, I DO THINK IT'S ATIDVANTAGEOUS IF TRUMP WI. TRUMP DOESN'T NEED TO LEARN LESSONS TO GET THE NOMINATION. HE WILL CONTINUE THE WAY HE IS WITHOUT THOSE LESSONS. AND, YOU KNOW, AS A PERSON, THIS IS THE RERUN THAT NO ONE WANTS TO WATCH, A BIDEN VERSUS TRUMP CAMPAIGN. I THINK THIS WILL HURT THE GOP AS IT HURT THEM IN THE MID-TERMS.  Charles: THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS GETTING MIXED REACTIONS. HERE'S CHRIS SUNUNU FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE.  HE MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT AT ONE OF HIS WEAKEST POINTS. WE JUST GOT CRUSHED IN THIS ELECTION. A LOT OF THINGS WILL CHANGE POLITICALLY BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE ANYTHING SERIOUS MOVES IN TERMS OF 2024.  Charles: YOU KNOW, KELSIE, A LOT OF THE REPUBLICANS THAT ARE COMING OUT AGAINST TRUMP NEVER LIKED TRUMP. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT LOVE HIM THAT DON'T LIKE HIM. SOME FOLKS WERE PUSHED OUT, SOME PEOPLE THAT NEVER GOT ALONG WITH HIM WELL. POINTS SIGNIFICANT INFIGHTING THAT SUGGESTS WHOEVER COMES OUT OF IT WON'T BE UNSCATHED, WILL BE A DAMAGED CANDIDATE AND THAT WILL BE DOOMED EFFORTS NO MATTER WHAT.  I THINK THE MEDIA LOVES THE DRAMA BETWEEN THESE NEVER TRUMPERS AND PRO TRUMPERS. BUT THE REALITY AT LEAST THIS ELECTION SEASON IS GOING TO BE MUCH MORE NUANCED THAN THAT. YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS BE QUESTIONING WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT CANDIDATE FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT. CAN HE DELIVER AN ELECTION WIN. BECAUSE WE KNOW THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S POLICIES ARE CAUSING SO MUCH DAMAGE AND HARDSHIP ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE NEED A CHANGE IN WASHINGTON AND THAT MEANS WE NEED A PRESIDENT, A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT THAT CAN WIN THESE INDEPENDENT VOTERS. THAT CAN BRING MORE PEOPLE IN TO THE PARTY, NOT FEWER. SO YES, TRUMP HAS A LOT OF ADVANTAGES GOING INTO THIS. BUT HE ALSO HAS A LOT OF WORK TO TO IN TERMS GETTING SUPPORT FROM A BROADER COALITION BEYOND HIS BASE.  Charles: WHAT IS INTRIGUING, TRUMPISM MIGHT STILL WIN OUT. I WANT TO SWITCH GEARS TO AN ISSUE THAT MAY HAVE HELPED DEMOCRATS IN THE MID-TERMS. WE'RE AUGUST THING ABOUT TOP EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WARNING THAT THE STUDENT LOAN DEFAULT RATES COULD SPIKE IF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S LOAN FORGIVENESS PROM GETS BLOCKED. DID THE ADMINISTRATION CABRERAATE THIS MESS? MAYBE IT WAS BAIT AND SWITCH IN THE FIRST PLACE. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT MILLENNIALS PULLED THE DEMOCRATS ACROSS THE LINE. THEY CAME OUT IN DROVES, THIS IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT BROUGHT THEM OUT. MAYBE THAW KNEW IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN THE FIRST PLACE. DID THAT BACKFIRE?  I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK THAT WE PROVED THAT THAT DID NOT BACKFIRE IN THE MID TERMS.  Charles: COULD IT BACKFIRE IN THE SENSE YOU TOLD ME MY LOAN WOULD GET FORGIVEN. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN. I GAVE YOU MY VOTE. YOU MISLED ME.  OF COURSE. THAT COULD HURT US. I DON'T THINK THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON AND CERTAINLY NOT WHAT BIDEN WANTS. HE RAN ON THIS AND REALLY BELIEVES THAT WE SHOULD PAY BACK PEOPLE'S LOANS. I THINK THAT WE SAW THAT HE'S STILL WINNING PEOPLE'S FAVOR IN THE MID-TERMS. AND I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO EARLIER. TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF THE MID-TERMS IN ORDER TO WIN. BUT HE SHOULD. HE HAS ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT BEING HIS FAULT FOR THE MID-TERMS. SO THE TRUMP BRANDT HAS BEEN ABOUT BEING AN ATTACK DOG AND NOT ACCEPTING THE OUTCOMES. INDEPENDENTS AND MODERATES WERE NOT HAVING IT. ON THE OTHER HAND, TRUMP CAN BLAME THE LOSSES ON ABORTION AND BLAMING HIM FOR THE MID-TERMS CAN BE SEEN AS A WAY FOR REPUBLICAN LEADERS TO AVOID GRIPPING THE FACT THAT THEIR STANCE ON ABORTION HURT THEM. FINALLY --  Charles: REAL QUICK.  THANK YOU. I JUST WANTED TO SAY WE CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT HIS COMPETITION. DESANTIS'S AD FOR GOVERNOR IS HOW HE'S GOING TO BE JUST LIKE TRUMP. HOW CAN DESANTIS ARGUE THAT HE'S A BETTER CHOICE THAN THE PERSON HE'S TRYING TO BE JUST LIKE? HE'S THE NEXT BEST THING.  Charles: THERE'S OTHER THINGS LIKE TEMPERAMENT, DELIVERY. YOU KNOW, THERE'S OTHER ASPECTS. WE KNOW THERE'S NUANCES. YOU UNDERSTAND THIS GAME. WE ALL DO. LADIES, THANKS VERY MUCH. I APPRECIATE IT. MEANWHILE, TROUBLE FOR TAYLOR SWIFT AND HER FANS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CONCERT TICKET MELDOWN. HOPE YOU WEREN'T SHUTOUT. WE HAVE DETAILS. AS THE FALL-OUT CONTINUES FROM THE COLLAPSE OF FTX, SOME LAWMAKERS ON CAPITOL HILL ARE SAYING CRYPTO? NO. HILLARY VAUGHN IS ON IT. .  HI, CHARLES. LAWMAKERS ARE MOM MISSING TO CRACK DOWN ON CRYPTO AND GET ANSWERS WHERE ALL OF THIS MONEY WENT FROM FTX FOUNDER SAM BANKMAN-FRIED. NOW THE FBI IS GETTING INVOLVED.

JUST DAYS AFTER THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, THE PROGRAM WENT TO A HALT. FOR MONTHS, WHY HAS DISMISSED MULTIPLE LAWSUITS, CLAIMING BIDEN HAD THE AUTHORITY TO WIPE OUT UP TO 20 GRAND OF LOANS. THE FEDERAL JUDGE RULED THAT ONLY CONGRESS HAS THE POWER TO DO THAT. ONE DEMOCRAT SEEMS TO STILL HAVE HOPE FOR THE PLAN.  I DON'T HAVE ANY DOUBT THAT THE PRESIDENT -- TO CANCEL THIS STUDENT LOAN DEBT. PRESIDENT TRUMP DID IT, PRESIDENT OBAMA DID IT, PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS DONE IT NOW ON STUDENT LOANS WITH -- BUT WE HAVE A COURT DOWN IN TEXAS. IF THEY ARE GOING TO PLAY POLITICS INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING THE LAW, THEY PUT THE PROGRAM AT RISK.  HOW IS THIS THE LAW?  DIDN'T JUST CALL JOE -- [LAUGHTER] -- SHE IS SUCH A CULTURAL APPROPRIATE HER. IT'S A SCAM, BUT THE SCAM WORKS. YOU HAVE TO GIVE PROPS. IT WAS THREE STEPS. STEP ONE IS PROMISE THE BRIDE, STEP TWO WIN, STEP THREE NEGATE THE REPUBLICANS WHEN THEY NEGATE THE BRIDE. [LAUGHS] YOU GET THE VOTES, REPUBLICANS GET THE BLAME. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW THE DEMS ARE GREAT AT CAMPAIGNING, NOT SO MUCH AT GOVERNMENTS, REPUBLICANS AREN'T GOOD AT CAMPAIGNING BUT ARE COMPETENT IN GOVERNANCE BUT YOU NEVER KNOW BECAUSE THEY NEVER GET ELECTED. [LAUGHTER] SO SPEND ALL OF YOUR EFFORTS CAMPAIGNING AND YOU WILL WIN, BUT YOU DON'T GOVERN! SPEAK OF THE THING THAT GOT TO ME IS THAT THERE IS THIS WOMAN CALLED BRIAND A GREAT JOY. SHE USED TO BE BERNIE'S NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY. SHE SAID \"THEY USED THE PROMISE OF STUDENT DEBT CANCELLATION TO INDUCE YOUNG VOTER TURNOUT FOR IT -- LABEL AUTHORITY. HARD TO CONVINCE ME THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION DID NOT DO THIS INTENTIONALLY.\"  ASKED ME AGAIN WHY REGULAR DEMOCRATS NEED THE BERNIE SANDERS SIDE OF THE PARTY. STUDENT LOAN DEBT FORGIVENESS WAS DEFINITELY PART OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. ELIZABETH WARREN, WHO HAS CAMPAIGNING ON THIS FOREVER. I BELIEVE BERNIE SANDERS -- AS WELL AND THAT IT'S LEGAL. IT WAS A SUSPENSION OF THIS BLOCK, PART OF A LARGER APPEAL TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHERE THEY TALKED ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. THE POINT IS THAT THERE WAS A WHOLESOME PACKAGE OF POLICIES --   -- IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF THE BIDEN POLICY.  THIS IS REAL, PALPABLE, TANGIBLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY YOUR DEBT ANYMORE. THANK JOE BIDEN AND THOSE VICIOUS REPUBLICANS THAT THEY WANT YOU TO PAY. WHO DO YOU THINK I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR? THE GUY THAT'S GIVING ME MONEY. IT WAS INTERESTING THE WAY ELIZABETH WARREN PUT IT. SHE SAID TRUMPETED IT. TRUMP GAVE THEM A SEASON OFF DURING THE PANDEMIC. JOE BIDEN WAS THE ONE THAT SAID \"I'M GOING TO PUT IN THE MONEY FOR YOU OR MAKE THE OTHER AMERICANS PAY IN TAXES.\" WAS VERY CLEAR WHEN HE SAID THIS IS ONE OF THE LARGEST EXECUTIVE BRANCH OVERREACHES IN THE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT EVEN PELOSI AND BIDEN KNEW THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE AUTHORITY. THEY EVEN SAID IT THEMSELVES. THIS WAS PART OF A BIG PLAN. WE HAVE GOT WOMEN ON ABORTION, THANK YOU GOD AND SUPREME COURT. NOW WE'VE GOT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WITH THE LOAN, WHO ARE IN, AND THEY ARE.  IT'S THE EVICTION MORATORIUM. IT WAS A SUGAR RUSH WHERE THEY KNEW THEY DID NOT HAVE A LABEL TO DO IT, THEY KNEW THERE WOULD BE PUSHED BACK, BUT THE LEFT IS GIVING THEM SUCH A HARD TIME THAT THEY DID IT ANYWAY. THEY TRIED TO HAVE HAPPY VIBES, AND THEN REPUBLICANS GET THE ENRICHMENT WHEN IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH, BECAUSE IT'S NOT LEGAL. SPEAK I'M GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND SAY THAT I WILL CANCEL EVERYONE'S BAR TAB, AND THEN --  I'M GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AND SAY THAT I WILL CANCEL EVERYONE'S BAR TAB, YOU CAN GO TO THE WEBSITE AND HAVE YOUR BAR TAB CANCELED AND THEN WHEN I GET ELECTED SAY \"SORRY, YOU HAVE TO PAY YOUR OWN BILL.\" BUT I'M IN THE OFFICE BY THEN! THAT BOOK OVER THE WEEKEND, A 600 PAGE TURNER.  FAST READER.  YOU ARE SMART. [LAUGHTER]  AT ONE POINT, HE WAS TELLING HIS ADVISORS AFTER ALL THE FREE STUFF SAYING \"CAN YOU COME UP WITH FREE STUFF I CAN PROMISE?\" HE UNDERSTANDS THE POWER OF FREE STUFF. IT'S LIKE OBAMACARE. ONCE YOU GIVE OUT FREE STUFF, IT'S HARD TO TAKE AWAY. THERE'S SOMETHING MORE NEFARIOUS GOING ON BESIDES THE FREE GOODIES. I EAVESDROP ON A CONVERSATION TODAY IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH A LOT OF COLLEGE STUDENTS. THERE WAS A WOMAN -- I'M NOT GOING TO DESCRIBE HER TOO DETAILED, BUT SHE HAD TATTOOS AND WAS NOT ATTRACTIVE. SHE WAS SPEAKING TO A YOUNGER COLLEGE STUDENT ALMOST AS AN ADVISOR, A LOOKOUT. SHE WAS EXPLAINING HOW SOCIALISM WAS THE GOAL, AND THAT -- AND THIS IS PART OF THE COURSEWORK. THIS POOR 18-YEAR-OLD INDIAN STUDENT WAS SITTING THERE LISTENING TO THIS OLDER WHITE WOMAN WITH TATTOOS AND A BAD HAIRCUT EXPLAINING HOW THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS ACTUALLY THE VILLAIN, BECAUSE THEY PRETEND THEY ARE ON THE SIDE OF THE WORKERS, BUT THEY ARE REALLY N NOT. CAPITALISM WASN'T A GOAL, CAPITALISM WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A VEHICLE TO ACHIEVE SOCIALISM, BECAUSE WE HAD TO GO FOR WORKERS RIGHTS, AND REPUBLICANS WERE MORE FASCISTS. I'M TRYING TO ORDER SALAD AND I'M LISTENING TO THIS 18-YEAR-OLD WOMAN HERE THESE KINDS OF THEORIES AND THINK \"THEY ARE SAYING THIS IN ALMOST EVERY CLASSROOM IN COLLEGE --  BACK UP.

[LAUGHTER]  CAN I ADD SOMETHING? I WILL LEAVE THAT IS THE FOLLOW-UP. [LAUGHTER]  I THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO DO A POLICY POINTS, BUT IT WAS ABOUT --  SALAD. WHO DOES THAT? IT'S LIKE A GUY SITTING ON THE GROUND! [LAUGHTER] NEVER ORDERING A SALAD AT THE DELI.  JESSICA, LAST WORD. [LAUGHTER]  HE'S TRYING TO -- [LAUGHTER]  WHAT?  WHEN THE OTHER SIDE, WHATEVER IT IS, IS COMING INTO OFFICE, AND THEY MAKE PROMISES, THEY SAY THINGS LIKE \"I'M GOING TO LOWER TAXES, THE CORPORATE TAX RATE.\" HOW IS THAT NOT A HANDOUT FOR INSTANCE?  IT'S THEIR MONEY! THEY ARE NOT HANDING OUT OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY! THEY ARE KEEPING WHAT THEY EARN!  YOU WALKED INTO THAT JESSICA. I WAS HERE WAVING MY HANDS. [LAUGHTER]  I THOUGHT YOU WERE TOSSING A SALAD. [LAUGHTER]  HOLIDAY TRENDS, MORE AIRLINE CHAOS. AN INCIDENT THAT SUMS UP THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT TO THE HOSPITAL NEXT.  MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL THEM THE NOT SO FRIENDLY -- SKY. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT SAID AFTER THE STASH THE PLANE WAS BEGINNING TO LAND, A WOMAN STOOD UP AND SCREAMED THAT THE TODDLER NEEDED TO THROW UP. WHEN FLIGHT ATTENDANTS TOLD HER TO SIT DOWN, THAT'S WHEN THINGS GOT UGLY.  WE ARE LANDING.  WE ARE GOING TO NEED SOMEONE -- [CROSSTALK]  STEP BACK. STEP BACK.  IN TOTAL, THREE PEOPLE, INCLUDING A 3-YEAR-OLD, WERE TAKEN TO HOSPITALS IN CHICAGO FOR OBSCENE INFORMATION -- OBSERVATION. POLICE AND THE FBI ARE INVESTIGATING. [LAUGHTER] GO AHEAD, YOU ARE FIRST.  WHO STANDS UP AND SAYS \"MY BABY HAS TO THROW UP\"? IF THEY WERE SICK, YOU HAVE THE BAG, YOU TELL THEM TO THROW UP, BE QUIET, AND SIT BACK. I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS! THE FBI WILL GET INVOLVED? DON'T THEY HAVE POLITICAL CASES?  SHE IS A DOMESTIC TERRORIST. GOT A BABY, WHO GIVES A DAMN ABOUT A BABY? HERE'S MORE ABOUT HER BABY DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. [LAUGHTER]  THEY ARE ALL JUST BEING OBSERVED.  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT, DO WE KNOW?  WHAT AN EASY JOB OBSERVING PEOPLE. I CAN DO THAT. CALL THE FBI. I WILL OBSERVE YOU.  AT A HOSPITAL BEING OBSERVED BY MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS, NOT JUST BY A POLICE OFFICER.  I THOUGHT THAT WAS ANTICLIMACTIC. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT HAPPENS?  I DON'T HAVE CHILDREN, YOU TELL ME AS A PARENT. WHAT DO YOU DO?  YOU GET THE BAG, YOU STICK YOUR KIDS HEAD IN THE BAG, HE YACKS, AND THEN YOU ACT LIKE NOTHING HAPPENS.  THEN YOU JUST PUSH HIS HEAD BACK.  I'VE NEVER HAD TO DO THAT! I THINK THE LATE IT WAS A LITTLE EXTREME.  YES.  I HAVE WONDERFUL EXPERIENCES WITH MY FLIGHT ATTENDANTS. THIS MORNING I WAS ON JETBLUE. WE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS. FIRST OF ALL, THE WI-FI WAS BROKEN, SHE KEPT ON SAYING IT WAS \"IN-OP,\" SHORT FOR INOPERABLE. IT TOOK ME A BIT TO FIGURE OUT. THING YOU WATCHED ALL MY CONCERN OF YOUR PLUGS INTO IT TO WATCH MOVIES WAS BROKEN. I HAD TO WATCH A LIAM NEESON MOVIE WITH THE SUBTITLES. [LAUGHTER]  YOU'RE SAYING JETBLUE DID NOT HAVE A SIGNER? [LAUGHTER]  I REALLY WOULD'VE EXPECTED ONE, BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT. THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS GREAT AT JETBLUE.  YOU KNOW IT'S WEIRD ABOUT JETBLUE? THEY HAVE THE OLD SCHOOL ATTITUDE OF THE '80s AUNT 'IN TERMS OF POLITENESS. THEY ACT LIKE IT'S A SERVICE THEY ARE PROVIDING YOU, THEY ARE HAPPY, THEY ARE PLEASANT, UNLIKE OTHERS WHO FEEL LIKE THEY ARE DOING YOU A FAVOR. DELTA?  HOW DARE YOU!  DELTA ALL THE BEST.  ARE YOU TRYING TO PUT THEM ON NOTICE THAT THEY REALLY NEED TO FORM --  I HAD SOME INTERESTING EXPERIENCES WITH ALTO DURING COVID, SO WE WILL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT  AGAIN, YOU ARE FLYING -- WHAT FLIGHT?  I DON'T KNOW WHERE. I MADE IT ALL UP.  DELTA -- GREG GUTFELD IN THE MORNING. THE NEW YORK AREA.  I WILL BE THERE TWO HOURS EARLY. LGN!  I AM FLYING DELTA TOMORROW MORNING.

        "trs": "AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT EXCITING MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS THAT CAN PROVIDE BROAD COVERAGE AND STILL MAY SAVE YOU MONEY ON MONTHLY PREMIUMS AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WITH ORIGINAL MEDICARE YOU ARE COVERED FOR HOSPITAL STAYS AND DOCTOR OFFICE VISITS BUT YOU HAVE TO MEET A DEDUCTIBLE FOR EACH, AND THEN YOU'RE STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR 20% OF THE COST. NEXT, LET'S LOOK AT A MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PLAN. AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY COVER THE SAME THINGS AS ORIGINAL MEDICARE, AND THEY ALSO COVER YOUR MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLES AND COINSURANCE. BUT THEY OFTEN HAVE HIGHER MONTHLY PREMIUMS AND NO PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE. NOW, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HUMANA'S MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS. WITH A HUMANA MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN, HOSPITALS STAYS, DOCTOR OFFICE VISITS AND YOUR ORIGINAL MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLES ARE COVERED. AND, OF COURSE, MOST HUMANA MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS INCLUDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE. WITH NO COPAYS OR DEDUCTIBLES ON TIER 1 PRESCRIPTIONS, AND ZERO DOLLARS FOR ROUTINE VACCINES, INCLUDING SHINGLES, AT IN-NETWORK RETAIL PHARMACIES. IN FACT, IN 2021, HUMANA MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN MEMBERS SAVED AN ESTIMATED $9,600 ON AVERAGE ON THEIR PRESCRIPTION COSTS. MOST HUMANA MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS HAVE COVERAGE FOR VISION AND HEARING. AND DENTAL COVERAGE THAT INCLUDES TWO FREE CLEANINGS A YEAR, PLUS DENTURES, CROWNS, FILLINGS AND MORE! MOST HUMANA MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS INCLUDE A SILVER SNEAKERS FITNESS PROGRAM AT NO EXTRA COST. YOU GET ALL OF THIS FOR AS LOW AS A ZERO-DOLLAR MONTHLY PLAN PREMIUM IN MANY AREAS; AND YOUR DOCTOR AND HOSPITAL MAY ALREADY BE A PART OF HUMANA'S LARGE NETWORK. THERE IS NO OBLIGATION, SO CALL THE NUMBER ON YOUR SCREEN RIGHT NOW TO SEE IF YOUR DOCTOR IS IN OUR NETWORK; TO FIND OUT IF YOU COULD SAVE ON YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS, AND TO GET OUR FREE DECISION GUIDE. HUMANA, A MORE HUMAN WAY TO HEALTHCARE.  Dana: THREE PEOPLE ARE DEAD AND TWO WOUNDED AFTER A MASS SHOOTING ON THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA CAMPUS LAST NIGHT. A MANHUNT IS UNDERWAY FOR THE SUSPECT. HE IS A STUDENT AND MAY BE DRIVING A BLACK S.U.V.  WITH VIRGINIA PLATES. UNIVERSITY ISSUED A SHELTER IN PLACE ORDER AND CANCELED ALL CLASSES TODAY. UNIVERSITY OFFICIALS WILL HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE AT THE TOP OF THE HOUR AND BRING IT TO YOU LIVE AS IT HAPPENS.  Bill: WAITING FOR MORE INFORMATION. LAWMAKERS ON THE HILL TODAY. BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO LEADS EACH PARTY IN BOTH THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. CHAD PERGRAM IS READING THE TEA LEAVES AND WILL FILE THE CEDEINGS FOR US.  WE DON'T KNOW WHICH PARTY WILL CONTROL THE HOUSE. THE GOP IS CURRENTLY AT 212 SEATS. 204 FOR THE DEMOCRATS. REPUBLICANS LEAD IN TEN REMAINING RACES. DEMOCRATS IN NINE. NOW FOUR OF THOSE RACES ARE ON THE EDGE. DEMOCRATS COULD HOLD THE HOUSE OR REPUBLICANS COULD BE MIRED AT 218 IF THOSE RACES DON'T BREAK IN FAVOR OF THE GOP. 218 IS THE MAGIC NUMBER FOR HOUSE CONTROL. PRESIDENT BIDEN JUST WEIGHED IN WHEN ASKED A QUESTION ABOUT BANNING ABORTION.  President Biden: I DON'T THINK THERE IS ENOUGH VOTES TO CODIFY UNLESS SOMETHING HAPPENS UNUSUAL IN THE HOUSE. I THINK WE'LL GET VERY CLOSE IN THE HOUSE BUT I DON'T -- I THINK IT WILL BE VERY CLOSE. I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT.  WHY LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS ARE UP IN THE AIR AND HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI IS DEFERRING HER DECISION UNTIL MORE IS KNOWN.  ANY DECISION TO RUN IS ABOUT FAMILY AND ALSO MY COLLEAGUES. THOUGH MY DECISION WILL THEN BE ROOTED IN THE WISHES OF MY FAMILY AND THE WISHES OF MY CAUCUS. NONE OF IT WILL BE CONSIDERED UNTIL WE SEE WHAT THE OUTCOME OF ALL OF THIS IS.  ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY LACKS THE VOTES TO BECOME SPEAKER SHOULD THE GOP BE IN CONTROL. DEMOCRATS COULD GROW SENATE MAJORITY TO 51 IF THEY WIN THE GEORGIA RUNOFF. FLORIDA'S RICK SCOTT WANTS TO POSTPONE LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS THERE.  WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING THESE ELECTIONS. WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND SAY TO OURSELVES WHEN REPUBLICANS DO WHAT LEADERSHIP HAS DONE THIS LAST YEAR AND OUR CANDIDATES HAVE TO BE FRUSTRATED WITH THEIR LEADERSHIP CAVING IN ON THE DEBT CEILING AND GUN BILL AND FAKE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL.  SCOTT PLANNED TO CHALLENGE MITCH MCCONNELL. MCCONNELL THINKS SCOTT IS PARTLY TO BLAME BY NOT GETTING INVOLVED IN GOP PRIMARIES. SCOTT RAN REPUBLICAN RE-ELECTION EFFORTS.  Bill: THANK YOU. WE'RE WAITING. CHAD PERGRAM ON THE HILL. THANKS.  Dana: AS BOTH PARTIES CONSIDER WHO WILL LEAD HIM JOSH HAWLEY SAID THIS. THE OLD PARTY IS DEAD. TIME TO BURY IT AND BUILD SOMETHING NEW. LE LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL. JUAN, WHAT PARTY -- I THINK HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. HOW IT GETS REBUILT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT EVEN HAPPENS. THERE WILL BE CHANGES NO DOUBT BECAUSE THERE ARE CHANGES AFTER EVERY ELECTION. THE DEMOCRATS, I THINK THEY'RE PROBABLY FEELING FAIRLY GOOD. DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE FOR DEMOCRATS TO THINK THAT THEY NOW HAVE A MANDATE RATHER THAN THAT THEY GOT SOME LUCKY BREAKS HERE?  I THINK IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO THINK THEY GOT A MANDATE. WHAT YOU'VE SEEN IN THIS ELECTION WE HAVE A SPLIT COUNTRY AND THAT BOTH REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY SPECIFICALLY PRAGMATIC TERMS TALKING ABOUT INDEPENDENT AND SWING VOTERS WHO BARELY WENT TOWARD THE DEMOCRATS. NOT IN ANY LARGE MEASURE. BUT WHEN I LISTENED TO SENATOR HAWLEY WHAT I THINK THERE ARE TWO THINGS GOING ON. CLEARLY A VERSION OF THE 2012 AUTOPSY. REPUBLICANS FEEL THEY HAD A DEADLY PERFORMANCE IN THE MID-TERM, UNDERPERFORMED AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY. FROM HAWLEY'S PERSPECTIVE I THINK WE ARE SEEING AMBITION. I THINK HAWLEY, MARCO RUBIO, SENATOR FROM FLORIDA, RICK SCOTT AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM THE ANALYSIS FROM CHAD PERGRAM, I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS HIS EFFORT TO PUSH HIMSELF INTO SENATE LEADERSHIP. HE WOULD LIKE TO REPLACE MCCONNELL. SCOTT HAS BEEN AT THIS FOR SOME TIME. I THINK SCOTT HAS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT MCCONNELL CALLED POORLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES BEING OUT THERE AND LOSING.  Dana: MATT. YOU HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS. NOT YOUR FIRST RODEO WHEN IT COMES TO MID-TERM. HOW DOES THIS CURRENT SITUATION COMPARE TO WHAT YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED IN THE PAST FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN PARTICULAR?  YOU KNOW, THIS HAS A LOT OF SHADES OF 1998 WHERE WE ACTUALLY DID KEEP THE HOUSE BACK THEN. WE LIKELY TO WIN IT NOW. SO THERE IS CONSTERATION AROUND THAT. THE TWEET IS HYPERBOLIC BUT VAGUE. ONE THING I'M CURIOUS, DOES HE MEAN PRESIDENT TRUMP, TOO? HE IS SOMEBODY WHO IS LOOKING AT RUNNING AGAIN AND LIKELY TO. LOOK, I GET IT. I'M ANGRY, HE IS ANGRY. WE ALL SHOULD BE ANGRY WITH HOW THINGS TURNED OUT. NOT THE WAY WE HOPED OR EXPECTED. I DON'T THINK THE ANSWER IS DELAYING LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE IS NO ONE RUNNING AGAINST MCCONNELL AT THIS POINT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE ANSWER. I THINK THE IDEA OF NOT HAVING AN AGENDA. LET'S REMEMBER, MCCARTHY PUT IT OUT IN THE HOUSE AND GOVERNORS PUT ONE OUT AND THEY HAD THEIR ISSUES. IT WASN'T THE ONLY THING WE CAN PIN THIS ON.  Dana: AN ARTICLE IN THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" BY PETER BAKER POINTING OUT THAT JOE BIDEN HAS A DECISION TO MAKE. EXPECTED TO MAKE IT FAIRLY SOON. WILL HE RUN AGAIN? WE HAVE THANKSGIVING COMING UP NEXT WEEK. TIME TO BE WITH HIS FAMILY. JUAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY'LL DECIDE?  WELL, YOU KNOW, I CAN LOOK IN THE CRYSTAL BALL. IT IS FOGGY. WHAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY SEEING ON THE GROUND IN WASHINGTON IS THE WHITE HOUSE TEAM MAKING PLANS AS IF THEY ARE GOING FORWARD WITH A BIDEN RE-ELECTION EFFORT. I THINK A BIG PART OF THIS, DANA, WILL BE WHAT WE SEE TOMORROW FROM FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE BIG BRAG AS PETER BAKER POINTS OUT IN THE TIMES THIS MORNING, THE BIG BRAG FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN IS THAT HE IS THE ONE GUY WHO BEAT DONALD TRUMP. SO IF TRUMP IS BACK IN AND TRUMP IS NO YOUNGSTER, EITHER, THEN I THINK BIDEN WOULD FEEL EVEN MORE LIKELY TO GET INVOLVED.  H  Dana: MATT, DO YOU HAVE SILVER LINING FOR REPUBLICANS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING POSITIVE TO FOCUS ON?  YEAH. IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO WIN THE HOUSE. REGARDLESS THAT'S A PRETTY BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT. WE'LL TAKE BIDEN'S CREDIT CARD AWAY. HE HAD COMPLETE UNIFIED CONTROL OF GOVERNMENT AND TALKS ABOUT CODIFYING ROE. HE DIDN'T HAVE THE HOUSE, SENATE AND PRESIDENCY FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS WHEN HE COULD HAVE DONE IT. WE'LL SLOW DOWN THE SPENDING AND TRY OUR BEST TO UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY AND PUT PRESSURE ON BIDEN TO ANSWER FOR WHY THEY AREN'T DOING THAT. AGAIN, YOU KNOW, DIDN'T MEET EXPECTATIONS BUT LET'S NOT FORGET WE WON THE HOUSE AND WE'LL STOP JOE BIDEN'S SPENDING SPREE.  Dana: MAJORITY IS THE MAJORITY AND HAVE A LOT OF CHANGES COMING TO WASHINGTON SOON. WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU BOTH. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THANKS.  Bill: A MOMENT PARENTS RIGHTS SEEN AS A DEFINING ISSUE. HOW DID THAT PAN OUT AT THE POLLS? CLOSER LOOK AT THAT. WHAT'S UP WITH SIMBA? THE BROADWAY SHOW THE LION KING FIRING SOMEONE BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE.

THE UNIVERSITY SAYS HE IS A STUDENT THERE. DAVID SPUNT GOT TO CHARLOTTESVILLE FOR US LIVE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. WHAT DO YOU KNOW THIS MORNING  THREE PEOPLE KILLED. WE'RE NOT SURE IF STUDENTS. WAITING TO GET MORE INFORMATION. TWO INJURED. A MANHUNT UNDERWAY. IT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT IN THE 10:00 HOUR BEHIND ME SUNDAY NIGHT INSIDE A PARKING GARAGE HERE ON THE CAMPUS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. RIGHT NOW POLICE ARE LOOKING FOR A SUSPECT THAT THEY NAMED SHORTLY AFTER THE SHOOTING TOOK PLACE. THEY SAY HIS NAME IS CHRISTOPHER DARNELL JONES JUNIOR. HE IS A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT CONFIRMED THAT HE IS A STUDENT. WE'RE TOLD HE WAS ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM AT SOME POINT AT LEAST IN 2018. IT IS NOT CLEAR IF HE EVER PLAYED OR THE LAST TIME HE MAY HAVE PLAYED ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM. ACCORDING TO AUTHORITIES, DANA AND BILL, HE MIGHT BE DRIVING A BLACK S.U.V.  WITH VIRGINIA TAG TWX3580. RIGHT NOW THERE IS A SHELTER IN PLACE HERE IN CHARLOTTESVILLE AT THE LOCAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL, HIGH SCHOOL, ALL OF THE COMMUNITY OFFICES AND CITY OFFICES ARE CLOSED TODAY. CLASSES ARE CANCELED. PEOPLE ARE BEING TOLD TO SHELTER IN PLACE AS THEY LOOK FOR CHRISTOPHER DARNELL JONES JUNIOR. CERTAINLY A FRIGHTENING SCENE AND WAITING FOR UPDATES. WE ARE GETTING UPDATES VIA SOCIAL MEDIA. WE'RE WAITING FOR SOME UPDATES ON CAMERA TO GIVE US AN IDEA OF EXACTLY WHERE POLICE ARE IN THEIR INVESTIGATION. RIGHT NOW THERE IS AN ACTIVE MANHUNT, THREE PEOPLE DEAD, TWO WOUNDED. DANA AND BILL.  Dana: THANK YOU. BACK TO YOU FOR MORE UPDATES.  Bill: CONTROL OF THE HOUSE IS STILL OUTSTANDING RIGHT NOW. LATE ON SUNDAY REPUBLICANS GOT SOME GOOD NEWS IN A COUPLE KEY RACES. A FEW OF THEM DOWN HERE IN ARIZONA AND A FEW OTHERS IN CALIFORNIA. HERE IS WHERE THE QUESTION MARK IS. ARIZONA ONE, OKAY? THIS IS EAST OF PHOENIX IN THE SCOTTSDALE. THE REPUBLICAN HANGING ON RIGHT NOW TO A LEAD OF 900 VOTES WITH AN ESTIMATED COUNT OF 94,000 COMING IN THUS FAR. LET ME POP OUT HERE. HERE ON THE BORDER HAS BEEN TRAILING. THEN OVERTOOK HIS CHALLENGER ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. THE DIFFERENCE IS 1700 VOTES THERE. REPUBLICANS ARE STARTING TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT THOSE TWO RACES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY FLIPPED. CALIFORNIA THERE IS A TON. BRING A LOT OF PATIENCE. IT COULD TAKE SEVERAL DAYS. MAIL-IN VOTES ARRIVE ON SATURDAY, SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY AND WAIT TO COUNT THEM UP. HERE IS WHERE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE HANGING IN. THE PROBLEM THERE IN THIS RACE, HERE IS THE MARGIN. 2800. THE PROBLEM THAT 53%. I CHECKED IT ON FRIDAY AND I CHECKED IT ON SATURDAY AND CHECKED IT YESTERDAY. THIS HASN'T MOVED, OKAY? WE'RE STILL WAITING ON A LOT OF VOTES IN CALIFORNIA 22. SHOW YOU ONE OTHER ONE HERE COME FORWARD THIS IS CALIFORNIA 41 HERE. THIS IS ONE THAT MOVED TOWARD THE REPUBLICANS AS WELL. MORE OF THE VOTE HAS BEEN COUNTED. HE HAS A LEAD HERE. DIFFERENCE OF 4,000 VOTES. THEY'RE HANGING ON, REPUBLICANS ARE THERE. SHOW YOU ONE MORE TO SHOW YOU HOW CLOSE THESE RACES COULD BE. IN THE END A LOT OF THESE REALLY COULD BE A RECOUNT OR THEY COULD BE SEPARATED IN THIS RACE IN CALIFORNIA 13 BY 84 VOTES. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. LET'S MOVE ACROSS THE ROOM RIGHT NOW. I THINK RIGHT NOW REPUBLICANS CAN GET TO 218. THERE ARE SOME INSIDERS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. TO PUT IT AT 219 TO 222.  Dana: WE HAVE JOSH. DO YOU THINK REPUBLICANS ARE COMFORTABLE SAYING THEY'LL HAVE THE MAJORITY WHEN THEY ALL COME IN?  IT IS CLEAR REPUBLICANS ARE FAVORED TO WIN THE MAJORITY. IT WILL BE A NARROW MAJORITY. THOSE DEVELOPMENTS, TWO VERY ENCOURAGING SIGNS IN ARIZONA FOR REPUBLICANS. A LOT OF THOSE REMAINING BALLOTS WILL LEAN REPUBLICAN. IT IS NOT A CALL YET. REPUBLICANS ARE FEELING BETTER THAN YESTERDAY. CALIFORNIA, BOY, WE'LL WAIT SOME TIME AS YOU SAID. THAT CALVERT RACE WAS ONE REPUBLICANS WERE WORRIED ABOUT. THE BATCH OF VOTES OVERNIGHT IS FAVORABLE FOR REPUBLICANS. A 7 OR 8 SEAT PICKUP. THAT'S A NARROW MAJORITY BUT A MAJORITY FOR MCCARTHY.  Bill: WHAT DID YOU CONCLUDE ABOUT WHY THIS BROKE THE WAY IT DID?  IT IS ALL ABOUT INDEPENDENTS. ONE OF THE ASSUMPTIONS WE HAD WITH THE ECONOMY THE WAY IT WAS AND PEOPLE THINKING THE COUNTRY WAS HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION THEY USUALLY BREAK AGAINST THE PARTY IN POWER. THEY NARROWLY VOTE FOR THE DEMOCRATS. SWING VOTERS WANTED TO CHECK THE WHITE HOUSE BUT WANTED TO CHECK THE MORE EXTREME ELEMENTS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE RACES THEY NOMINATED FIRST-TIME CANDIDATES. SOME CANDIDATES THAT MAY BE A LITTLE TOO FAR TO THE RIGHT IN THE STATES THEY WERE RUNNING IN AND THAT COST THE REPUBLICANS POLITICALLY IN THE SENATE AND THE LARGER BRAND AFFECTED EVEN THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHERE SOME GOOD CANDIDATES IN BLUE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY COULDN'T QUITE GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T WIN ENOUGH SWING VOTE.  Dana: REPUBLICANS DID BETTER WITH LATINOS, ASIAN AND BLACK AMERICANS. NOT AS MUCH AS THEY THOUGHT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT A POLITICAL REALIGNMENT ARE THESE BABY STEPS AS YOU GET MORE OF THE VOTE WHAT YOU CAN COUNT ON IN THE FUTURE?  THEY ARE BABY STEPS. THEY DID BETTER WITH HISPANICS AND ASIAN-AMERICANS BUT THEY ALSO STRUGGLED WITH SUBURBAN WHITE VOTERS THAT WAS PART OF THE BIG BIDEN COALITION IN 2020. A LOT OF ANALYSIS WAS A LOT OF FOLKS WERE FEELING THE PINCH ECONOMICALLY AND THEY SWING BACK AND FORTH AND THEY WOULD GO TO THE REPUBLICANS. THEY ENDED UP STICKING WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. ABORTION WAS A BIG FACTOR IN SOME KEY STATES AND SOME OF THE CANDIDATES WERE TOO FAR TO THE RIGHT. MAYBE TOO FAR -- TO ALIGNED WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP THAT ULTIMATELY THEY DIDN'T GO TOWARDS THE REPUBLICANS BUT SPLIT MORE EVENLY.  Bill: THE YOUTH VOTE LAST WEEK WE THOUGHT IT WAS SUBSTANTIAL. THERE SEEMS TO BE A RE-EVALUATION OF HOW SUBSTANTIAL IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN. SMALL S AS OPPOSED TO CAPITAL S. IF YOU ARE DEMOCRATS AND SEAN PATRICK MALONEY. YOU HANG ONTO THE SENATE AND YOU LOSE THE HOUSE BY 2 OR 3 VOTES, THEN YOU START LOOKING AT BLUE BLUE STATE OF NEW YORK AND YOU ASK YOURSELF WHY DID WE ALLOW 3, 4, SEATS TO FLIP? HAD THEY HELD THEM AS WE FOUND OUT IN OTHER PLACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THEY MIGHT HAVE MAINTAINED CONTROL IN BOTH CHAMBERS.  ISSUES MATTER AND EVERY STATE HAD THEIR OWN DIFFERENT POLITICAL DYNAMIC. CRIME WAS THE TOP ISSUE IN NEW YORK. THERE WAS A SENSE THAT THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP STARTING FROM GOVERNOR HOCHUL WASN'T ADDRESSING THE ISSUE. IT HAD DOWN-BALLOT EFFECTS. EFFECTS IN THE SUBURB IN LONG ISLAND AND HUDSON VALLEY. NEW YORK CITY SWUNG A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT. NOT ENOUGH TO GET LEE ZELDIN TO THE GOVERNORSHIP WITHIN FIVE POINTS. YOU GOT FIVE NEW REPUBLICANS FROM NEW YORK IN THE BIDEN-FRIENDLY DISTRICT. A LOT OF DEMOCRATS SAID WE ARE MOVING TO THE MIDDLE ON CRIME. IN NEW YORK YOU HAD DEMOCRATS RUNNING TO THE LEFT ON CRIME.  Dana: GREAT TO HAVE YOU. IT IS NOT OVER YET.  STILL COUNTING.  Dana: THANK YOU SO MUCH. AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF MAJOR DIGITAL CURRENCY EXCHANGE FTX THERE ARE GROWING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE COMPANY'S FORMER CEO USED CUSTOMER FUNDS.

ONE OF THE REAL BRIGHT SPOTS FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE MIDTERMS WAS FLORIDA WHER ONE OF THE REAL BRIGHT SPOTS FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE MIDTERMS WASA FLORIDA TE SEAT AND 20 HOUSE SEAS IN FLORIDA. IN FLORIDA'S 17TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT BYRON DONALDS WON A SECOND TERM WITH MORE THAN DOUBLE THE VOTES OVER HIS OPPONENT, DEMOCRAT CHALLENGER. SO WHAT HAS BEEN THE KEYS TO SUCCESS FOR FLORIDA REPUBLICANS? HERE TO EXAMINE THAT IS CONGRESSMAN BYRON DONALDS HIMSELF. CONGRATULATIONS, CONGRESSMAN. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE.  THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON, AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT WAS A BIG NIGHT IN FLORIDA, OBVIOUSLY. MARIA: SO WHAT HAPPENED? HOW COME FLORIDA DID SO WELL, THE STARS OF THE ENTIRE MIDTERM?  WELL, I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE, IF YOU EVEN GO BACK TO COVID-19, WE HAD PEOPLE THAT CHOSE FLORIDA. THAT IS VERY, VERY CLEAR. NUMBER TWO, BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE MANAGED OUR STATE COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. VOTERS KNEW UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT, IT DIDN'T MATTER YOUR POLITIC OR DEMOGRAPHICS, THAT FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR WAS CRITICAL. AND NUMBER THREE MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE'VE BEEN A REPUBLICAN STATE FOR 30 YEARS. OUR CITIZENS ARE ACCUSTOMEDDED TO REPUBLICAN GOVERNANCE, AND WE'VE NOT SHIED AWAY FROM THAT. THAT REALLY IS THE TEMPLATE FOR THE REST OF AMERICA. BUT YOU HAVE TO BE BOLD ABOUT YOUR PRINCIPLES AND YOUR POLICIES. YOU SHOULDN'T RUN AWAY FROM THEM, YOU SHOULDN'T BE SHY ABOUT THEM, AND THE VOTERS WILL REWARD YOU BECAUSE OF THAT. MARIA: YEAH, I LOVE IT. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO GET INTO THIS MORNING WITH YOU, AND THAT IS LEADERSHIP AND YOUR BID FOR THE HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN. YOU KNOW THE NEWS THAT JACQUI HEINRICH IS REPORTING OVER ON FOX NEWS, SHE SAYS SHE HAS TWO SOURCES THAT YOU ARE TELLING MEMBERS THAT YOU WOULD SUPPORT RON DeSANTIS OVER DONALD TRUMP IN 2024 AS PART OF YOUR PITCH TO BE HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE CHAIR. DO YOU SUPPORT DeSANTIS OVER TRUMP?  OH, FIRST THING I'M GOING TO TELL YOU IS THAT THE REPORTING IS FALSE. I DON'T KNOW WHO THESE SOURCES ARE, BUT I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND I'VE NEVER HAD CONVERSATIONS HIKE THAT WITH ANY MEMBERS -- LIKE THAT. IT'S UNFORTUNATE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD PUT OUT RUMORS LIKE THIS, I FIND IT TO BE A KISS TRACTION. NUMBER THREE, NOBODY'S ACTUALLY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW. DONALD TRUMP'S THE LEADER IN THE CLUBHOUSE. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION, BUT AM I SUPPORTING ONE OVER THE OTHER RIGHT NOW? NO, THAT IS NOT TRUE. MARIA: ALL RIGHT. LET ME GET YOUR TAKE ON LEADERSHIP TODAY BECAUSE, CONGRESSMAN, YOU KNOW THE KNIVES ARE OUT FOR THE LEADERSHIP. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MITCH McCONNELL, THERE'S ALSO WHISPERS AROUND KEN McCARTHY AND WHAT'S -- KEVIN McCARTHY AND IN TERMS OF HIM BILLIONING THE SPEAKERS -- SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. WHAT IS GOING ON IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP? WILL McCARTHY GET THE GAVEL?  MEMBERS HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. NUMBER ONE, OBVIOUSLY, THE EXPECTATIONS WERE NOT DELIVERED. NUMBER TWO, HOW ARE WE ACTUALLY GOING TO GOVERN WHAT'S APPEARING TO BE A SMALL MAJORITY? I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR PREVIOUS SEGMENT WITH STEPHEN MULLER. WE HAVE TO -- MILLER. WE HAVE TO LAY OUT A DEMONSTRATED PLAN, SERIOUS POLICIES THAT VOTERS ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN, AND WE CAN'T EQUIVOCATE FROM THAT EVEN IN WHAT'S LOOKING TO BE CONTINUED DIVIDED GOVERNMENT, GRIDLOCKED GOVERNMENT. REPUBLICAN MEMBERS WANT TO GET ANSWERS TO THAT, AND I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL TOWARDS KEVIN'S ABILITY TO BECOMING THE LEADER AND EVENTUALLY THE SPEAKER. MARIA: WHO WILL CHALLENGE HIM?  THAT IS NOT CLEAR AT AT THIS TIME. NOBODY KNOWS THAT. MARIA: WE KNOW THAT THE FREEDOM CAUCUS HAS BEEN TALKING A BIT, AND WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND MORE WHERE THE STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS IS WITHIN THE GOP. WHY WASN'T THERE MORE EFFORTS AROUND THE BORDER, AROUND CRIME? YOU HAD YOUR COMMITMENT TO AMERICA, AND YET IT APPEARS THAT, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE THINGS LIKE THE BORDER AND MAYRA FLORES, HOW DID SHE LOSE?  WELL, I THINK -- LET ME SAY SOMETHING. I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO MESSAGING ABOUT BORDER ISSUES AND CRIME, I THINK WE ACTUALLY DID A GOOD JOB WITH THAT. MY ISSUE WAS WE CAN'T COME UP WITH A CLEAR AGENDA AROUND ABORTION, WHAT IT MEAN MEANS. IN STATES LIKE ARIZONA AND NEVADA, SOME OF THE RACES HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON, THE DEMOCRATS WERE LYING TO VOTERS. THEY'RE RUNNING AROUND SAYING REPUBLICANS HAVE A NATIONWIDE BAN TO GO. BUT IF YOU READ THE DOBBS DECISION, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NO ROLE IN ABORTION ANYMORE. IT IS NOW A STATE THE'S ISSUE -- TATE'S ISSUE. THE DEMOCRATS KNOW THIS, THEY WERE LYING TO VOTERS. THE PROBLEM IS WE DID NOT HAVE A MESSAGE, WE DID NOT HAVE A STRATEGY ON HOW TO COMBAT THAT. WE ESSENTIALLY IGNORED THAT ISSUE, AND THAT, IN MY OPINION, IS WHAT HURT US IN THESE ELECTIONS. MARIA: THAT'S TOO BAD. CONGRESSMAN, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING. WE'LL BE FOLLOWING YOUR LEADERSHIP, FOR SURE. THANKS VERY MUCH. BYRON DONALDS JOINING US THIS MORNING IN FLORIDA. THANK YOU, SIR. > ALL RIGHT. QUICK BREAK AND THEN SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL HELD THE PURSESTRINGS THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN SEASON, AND HE BLOCKED MANY TRUMP CANDIDATES. NOW HE'S CAMPAIGNING TO KEEP HIS POST AS GOP LEADER. SHOULD HE OR IS HE VULNERABLE?

WE STILL LOVE TRUMP, BUT RON DeSANTIS IS GREAT TOO, WE APPRECIATE WHAT HE'S DONE IN FLORIDA, HE HAS A WINNING PATH, AND IF THEY SAY WE PREFER DeSANTIS BECAUSE HE'S PROVEN EFFECTIVE AND ACTUALLY WIN, A -- THEN WE'LL SEE. HOWARD: BUT WITH TRUMP ANNOUNCING TUESDAY NIGHT AND WE DON'T KNOW WHEN OR IF DeSANTIS GETS IN, WE WOULDN'T HEAR FROM THE ACTUAL VOTERS FOR ANOTHER YEAR. IF DeSANTIS DOES RUN, WOULD MUCH OF THE MEDIA GIVE HIM SYMPATHETIC COVERAGE JUST TO GET RID OF TRUMP?  FIRST OF ALL, THE MEDIA'S GOING TO BE ONE THING. THEY WILL GO OUT AND TALK TO CONSERVATIVE CABLE NEWS, SOME CABLE NEWS SHOWS WILL WANT TO GIVE HIM PROBABLY A PRETTY POSITIVE LOOK, ESPECIALLY ONES THAT BELIEVE LIKE MANY CONSERVATIVES DO BELIEVE THAT TRUMP IS NOW A LOSER. HE'S LOST THREE TIMES IN A ROW -- HOWARD: 2018, 2020 --  -- AND 2032. HOWEVER, DeSANTIS ENDORSED ALL THE SAME CANDIDATES THAT LOST THAT DONALD TRUMP DID TOO. YES, THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT DeSANTIS IS ATTRACTING TREMENDOUS POSITIVE INTEREST IN THE CONSERVATIVE WORLD. HOWARD: RIGHT.  BUT, LOOK, WE HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE. CRITICISMS OF TRUMP AFTER ACCESS HOLLYWOOD, AFTER JANUARY 6TH, AND THEN THEY EVAPORATE RATE BECAUSE HE HAS SUCH A ROCK SOLID HOLD ON THE BASE, AND WE'RE GOING TO FIND THAT OUT EVENTUALLY. HOWARD: RIGHT. AND DeSANTIS HAS NEVER RUN A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN, SO WE'D HAVE TO SAY HOW HE DOES. JOHN FETTERMAN, EVEN AFTER THAT DISASTROUS DEBATE FOR THE RECOVERING STROKE VICTIM, BEAT DR. OZ PRETTY HANDILY IN PENNSYLVANIA. DID PARTISANS HELP REHABILITATE HIM BY HAVING THESE FRIENDLY, WE SEE IT THERE, CLOSED CAPTIONED INTERVIEWS WHERE HE SOUNDED MUCH BETTER?  OH, ABSOLUTELY. THAT WAS A TRAVESTY. YOU FELT SORRY FOR HIM WATCHING HIM. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO HAS A VERY SERIOUS MEDICAL SITUATION THAT IS NOT READY FOR THE KINDS OF STRESS AND ATTENTION THAT A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN GET. I THINK THAT WAS SO CLEAR. IT'S, I THINK IT'S BAFFLING TO MANY OF US THAT VOTERS STILL DECIDED THEY WOULD VOTE FOR FETTERMAN OVER DR. OZ -- [LAUGHTER] WELL, THAT SHOWS YOU CANDIDATES MATTER. AND FOR AS MUCH AS THE EXPECTATIONS WERE HIGH ON REPUBLICANS, PEOPLE LIKE DR. OZ, BLAKE MASTERS, HERSCHEL WALKER DIDN'T CONNECT WITH VOTERS. THEY HAD EVERYTHING GOING FOR THEM, AND THAT'S THEIR WEAKNESS RATHER THAN THE STRENGTH OF THE DEMOCRATS, I THINK. HOWARD: YOU BROUGHT UP HERSCHEL WALKER, THE GEORGIA RUNOFF BETWEEN HIM AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK SET FOR DECEMBER 6TH. IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT NATIONALLY NOW THAT THE DEMOCRATS WILL RETAIN CONTROL OF THE SENATE, BUT ILL -- STATE IT STILL COULD BE A BIG DEAL. WHEN HERR HERSCHEL WALKER SLUGGED OFF THE ABORTION SCANDAL, GEORGIA MEDIA SAID THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE GOP TAKING CONTROL. I DON'T SEE THE MEDIA SAYING WITH DEMOCRATIC VOTERS AND FETTERMAN THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT --  I ACTUALLY DISAGREE. I THINK THAT FETTERMAN AND WALKER ARE VERY, VERY SIMILAR, AND THEY WERE BOTH TESTING THE PROPOSITION THAT NOTHING MATTERS ANYMORE. WE'VE SEEN POLLS OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, OVER 60% OF THOSE VOTERS SAID THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO STICK WITH THEIR CANDIDATE EVEN IF HE HAD A PERSONAL, MORAL OR HEALTH PROBLEM. IN OTHER WORDS, WE'RE SO TRIBAL IN THE SENATE, YOU'RE BASICALLY TO BE IN THERE JUST TO BE A VOTE FOR YOUR TEAM, DIFFERENT THAN RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR. PEOPLE STICK WITH THEIR CANDIDATE. HERSCHEL WALKER WAS RUNNING AHEAD IN THE POLL AVERAGES UP UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE, WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR -- HOWARD: YEAH.  -- BUT HE WAS DOING PRETTY GOOD.  BUT KEMP WON DECISIVELY, RIGHT?  HE DIDN'T HAVE ALL THOSE --  JUST SAYING, RIGHT, THERE ARE MANY VOTERS WHO SAID, WHO WERE HAPPY, PROBABLY SOME INDEPENDENTS, DEMOCRATS, CENTRISTS WHO SAID, YEAH, I'LL VOTE FOR GOVERNOR KEMP, HE'S BEEN A GOOD GOVERNOR, BUT I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS HERSCHEL WALKER GUY, AND THAT'S HAPPENED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. HOWARD: ALL RIGHT. SO NANCY PELOSI GAVE A VERY EMOTIONAL INTERVIEW TO ANDERSON COOPER TALKING ABOUT HOW CAPITOL POLICE WOKE HER UP TO TELL HER THAT HER HUSBAND PAUL HAD BEEN ATTACK AD AND HIS CONDITION. AND AROUND -- ATTACKED AND HIS CONDITION. AND AROUND THE SAME TIME, DONALD TRUMP HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE HOUSE SPEAKER. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.  IT REALLY, IT'S REALLY SAD BECAUSE IT IS A FLAME THAT WAS FUELED BY MISINFORMATION AND ALL THE REST OF THAT.  I THINK SHE'S AN ANIMAL TOO, YOU WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY'LL SAY, OH, WHAT A HORRIBLE THING HE SAID ABOUT NANCY. SHE IMPEACHED ME TWICE FOR NOTHING! HOWARD: FIRST, ROBBY, COULD THAT HAVE REMINDED SOME PEOPLE WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE ABOUT TRUMP'S HYPER-AGGRESSIVE STYLE?  I THINK SO. I THINK MOST NORMAL PEOPLE HEAR THE STORY THAT A CRAZY PERSON BROKE INTO SOMEONE'S HOUSE AND ATTACKED AN OLD MAN, WOKE HIM UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND REGARDLESS OF WHO THAT IS, DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S PAUL PELOSI, THAT STORY DISTURBS PEOPLE. AND THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS SAY THAT'S HORRIBLE AND THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED AND, YOU KNOW, THE POLICE NEED TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. YOU LOOK AT SECURITY, THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT THE NORMAL REACTION FROM PEOPLE IS THAT'S BAD. AND IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT SOME SPIN ON IT, I THINK IT PLAYS SO BADLY --  DON'T FORGET, IT WASN'T JUST DONALD TRUMP. THERE WAS LOTS OF JOKES THAT CAME FROM REPUBLICANS. I THINK THAT WENT INTO THE SOUP ALONG WITH OVERTURNING ROE, ALONG WITH ELECTION DENIAL, ALONG WITH WEIRD ADS FROM BLAKE MASTERS ABOUT A HANDGUN. ALL THOSE THINGS CONVINCED INDEPENDENTS AND SUBURBAN WOMEN THAT REPUBLICANS WERE NOT MAINSTREAM, THEY WERE EXTREME. HOWARD: WELL, I'M NOT SAYING THAT NANCY PELOSI CAN'T BE CRITICIZED PRETTILY --  CERTAINLY NOT -- POLITICALLY. HOWARD: IN THAT ENVIRONMENT, CERTAINLY GAVE ME PAUSE. BEFORE WE GO, DONALD TRUMP MADE A PROPOSAL THAT I WONDER IF CNN COULD POSSIBLY RESIST. HE SAID THAT CNN SHOULD START A CONSERVATIVE NETWORK AND ONLY HAVE ME ON. [LAUGHTER] AND IT'LL BE THE BIGGEST SUCCESS IN THE HISTORY OF BROADCASTING. SOMEHOW I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING. > ALL RIGHT, AFTER THE BREAK, HOW BADLY DID POLLSTERS SCREW UP THE MIDTERMS? FRANK LUNTZ IS ON DECK. \u266a \u266a 20221113164012.192|20221113164344.453",

        "trs": "MARIA: WELCOME BACK. ONE OF THE REAL BRIGHT SPOTS FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE MIDTERMS WAS FLORIDA WHERE THEY DOMINATED UP AND COULD BE THE BALLOT, SECURING THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION, A SENATE SEAT AND 20 HOUSE SEATS IN FLORIDA. IN FLORIDA'S 17TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT BYRON DONALDS WON A SECOND TERM WITH MORE THAN DOUBLE THE VOTES OVER HIS OPPONENT, DEMOCRAT CHALLENGER. SO WHAT HAS BEEN THE KEYS TO SUCCESS FOR FLORIDA REPUBLICANS? HERE TO EXAMINE THAT IS CONGRESSMAN BYRON DONALDS HIMSELF. CONGRATULATIONS, CONGRESSMAN. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE.  THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON, AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT WAS A BIG NIGHT IN FLORIDA, OBVIOUSLY. MARIA: SO WHAT HAPPENED? HOW COME FLORIDA DID SO WELL, THE STARS OF THE ENTIRE MIDTERM?  WELL, I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE, IF YOU EVEN GO BACK TO COVID-19, WE HAD PEOPLE THAT CHOSE FLORIDA. THAT IS VERY, VERY CLEAR. NUMBER TWO, BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE MANAGED OUR STATE COMPARED TO OTHER STATES. VOTERS KNEW UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT, IT DIDN'T MATTER YOUR POLITIC OR DEMOGRAPHICS, THAT FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR WAS CRITICAL. AND NUMBER THREE MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE'VE BEEN A REPUBLICAN STATE FOR 30 YEARS. OUR CITIZENS ARE ACCUSTOMEDDED TO REPUBLICAN GOVERNANCE, AND WE'VE NOT SHIED AWAY FROM THAT. THAT REALLY IS THE TEMPLATE FOR THE REST OF AMERICA. BUT YOU HAVE TO BE BOLD ABOUT YOUR PRINCIPLES AND YOUR POLICIES. YOU SHOULDN'T RUN AWAY FROM THEM, YOU SHOULDN'T BE SHY ABOUT THEM, AND THE VOTERS WILL REWARD YOU BECAUSE OF THAT. MARIA: YEAH, I LOVE IT. THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO GET INTO THIS MORNING WITH YOU, AND THAT IS LEADERSHIP AND YOUR BID FOR THE HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE CHAIRMAN. YOU KNOW THE NEWS THAT JACQUI HEINRICH IS REPORTING OVER ON FOX NEWS, SHE SAYS SHE HAS TWO SOURCES THAT YOU ARE TELLING MEMBERS THAT YOU WOULD SUPPORT RON DeSANTIS OVER DONALD TRUMP IN 2024 AS PART OF YOUR PITCH TO BE HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE CHAIR. DO YOU SUPPORT DeSANTIS OVER TRUMP?  OH, FIRST THING I'M GOING TO TELL YOU IS THAT THE REPORTING IS FALSE. I DON'T KNOW WHO THESE SOURCES ARE, BUT I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND I'VE NEVER HAD CONVERSATIONS HIKE THAT WITH ANY MEMBERS -- LIKE THAT. IT'S UNFORTUNATE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD PUT OUT RUMORS LIKE THIS, I FIND IT TO BE A KISS TRACTION. NUMBER THREE, NOBODY'S ACTUALLY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW. DONALD TRUMP'S THE LEADER IN THE CLUBHOUSE. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT FOR THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION, BUT AM I SUPPORTING ONE OVER THE OTHER RIGHT NOW? NO, THAT IS NOT TRUE. MARIA: ALL RIGHT. LET ME GET YOUR TAKE ON LEADERSHIP TODAY BECAUSE, CONGRESSMAN, YOU KNOW THE KNIVES ARE OUT FOR THE LEADERSHIP. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MITCH McCONNELL, THERE'S ALSO WHISPERS AROUND KEN McCARTHY AND WHAT'S -- KEVIN McCARTHY AND IN TERMS OF HIM BILLIONING THE SPEAKERS -- SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. WHAT IS GOING ON IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP? WILL McCARTHY GET THE GAVEL?  MEMBERS HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS. NUMBER ONE, OBVIOUSLY, THE EXPECTATIONS WERE NOT DELIVERED. NUMBER TWO, HOW ARE WE ACTUALLY GOING TO GOVERN WHAT'S APPEARING TO BE A SMALL MAJORITY? I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR PREVIOUS SEGMENT WITH STEPHEN MULLER. WE HAVE TO -- MILLER. WE HAVE TO LAY OUT A DEMONSTRATED PLAN, SERIOUS POLICIES THAT VOTERS ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN, AND WE CAN'T EQUIVOCATE FROM THAT EVEN IN WHAT'S LOOKING TO BE CONTINUED DIVIDED GOVERNMENT, GRIDLOCKED GOVERNMENT. REPUBLICAN MEMBERS WANT TO GET ANSWERS TO THAT, AND I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL TOWARDS KEVIN'S ABILITY TO BECOMING THE LEADER AND EVENTUALLY THE SPEAKER. MARIA: WHO WILL CHALLENGE HIM?  THAT IS NOT CLEAR AT AT THIS TIME. NOBODY KNOWS THAT. MARIA: WE KNOW THAT THE FREEDOM CAUCUS HAS BEEN TALKING A BIT, AND WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND MORE WHERE THE STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS IS WITHIN THE GOP. WHY WASN'T THERE MORE EFFORTS AROUND THE BORDER, AROUND CRIME? YOU HAD YOUR COMMITMENT TO AMERICA, AND YET IT APPEARS THAT, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE THINGS LIKE THE BORDER AND MAYRA FLORES, HOW DID SHE LOSE?  WELL, I THINK -- LET ME SAY SOMETHING. I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO MESSAGING ABOUT BORDER ISSUES AND CRIME, I THINK WE ACTUALLY DID A GOOD JOB WITH THAT. MY ISSUE WAS WE CAN'T COME UP WITH A CLEAR AGENDA AROUND ABORTION, WHAT IT MEAN MEANS. IN STATES LIKE ARIZONA AND NEVADA, SOME OF THE RACES HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON, THE DEMOCRATS WERE LYING TO VOTERS. THEY'RE RUNNING AROUND SAYING REPUBLICANS HAVE A NATIONWIDE BAN TO GO. BUT IF YOU READ THE DOBBS DECISION, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NO ROLE IN ABORTION ANYMORE. IT IS NOW A STATE THE'S ISSUE -- TATE'S ISSUE. THE DEMOCRATS KNOW THIS, THEY WERE LYING TO VOTERS. THE PROBLEM IS WE DID NOT HAVE A MESSAGE, WE DID NOT HAVE A STRATEGY ON HOW TO COMBAT THAT. WE ESSENTIALLY IGNORED THAT ISSUE, AND THAT, IN MY OPINION, IS WHAT HURT US IN THESE ELECTIONS. MARIA: THAT'S TOO BAD. CONGRESSMAN, IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THIS MORNING. WE'LL BE FOLLOWING YOUR LEADERSHIP, FOR SURE. THANKS VERY MUCH. BYRON DONALDS JOINING US THIS MORNING IN FLORIDA. THANK YOU, SIR. > ALL RIGHT. QUICK BREAK AND THEN SENATOR MITCH McCONNELL HELD THE PURSESTRINGS THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN SEASON, AND HE BLOCKED MANY TRUMP CANDIDATES. NOW HE'S CAMPAIGNING TO KEEP HIS POST AS GOP LEADER. SHOULD HE OR IS HE VULNERABLE? FLORIDA SENATOR RICK SCOTT IS HERE, CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIALING COMMITTEE, AND HE WILL JOIN US ON WHETHER HE'S VYING FOR THE TOP JOB. THAT'S NEXT. \u266a \u266a 20221113151831.726|20221113152147.355",

        "trs": "WILL DEMOCRATS GETTING TO 50 SEATS THAT THEY NEED FOR MAJORITY CONTROL AS A NARROW MARGIN KEEPS THE DEMOCRAT IN HER SEAT.  HERE TO REACT OUTNUMBERED -- WOW, REALLY BUTCHERED THAT. HOW ARE YOU?  I AM DOING GREAT. I AM ON THE COUCH WITH YOU GUYS. RACHEL: WE FEEL LIKE WE ARE ON THE COUCH WITH YOU.  SUNDAY MORNING, I AM NOT WATCHING YOU FROM MY CAMO SLIPPERS. I AM RIGHT HERE. I AM RIGHT HERE WITH YOU. WHAT A WEEKEND. I WAS JUST SHARING WITH PETE WHAT I DO ON THE WEEKENDS. I TRIED TO DIGEST THE WEEK AND GET READY FOR THIS NEW ONE. I HAVE SO MANY THOUGHTS ON WHERE WE ARE IN POLITICS THIS MORNING. ULTIMATELY, JUST REALLY EXCITED PEOPLE VOTED.  TELL US YOUR THOUGHTS.  I WAS NOT ALL THAT SURPRISED THAT REPUBLICANS DID NOT TAKE THE SENATE. STRAIGHT OUT. I DO THINK THAT IF THEY REALLY PULL EVERYTHING OUT THAT THEY HAVE, THEY CAN GET 5050. THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT JUDGES AND APPOINTMENTS IN THIS SORT OF THING. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TIGHT ENOUGH CAP THAT IF THERE IS JUST ONE DEMOCRAT MAYBE YOU CAN WRANGLE SOME PEOPLE. IF YOU GET SOME PEOPLE TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE, IT MAY NOT SEEM IMPORTANT TO DEMOCRATS, BUT THEY ARE NOT BEING GENUINE ABOUT THAT AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE KAMALA HARRIS BREAKING THE TIDE YOU DON'T HAVE THE WORRY ABOUT KIERSTEN CINEMA AND JOE MANSION HAVING SO MUCH POWER IN THE PARTY. I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS EARLIER WITH REGARD TO MANSION. IT WAS NOT JUST HIM, IT WAS THE BOTH OF THEM. THEN HE GOT EXTRA CREDIT TO CONVINCE THEM TO COME ALONG. COAL COUNTRY DID NOT GET ALL THE PROMISES. INFLATION REDUCTION ACT. AND, SO, YOU KNOW, THERE IS STILL SOMEWHAT GO ROOM FOR REPUBLICANS TO WRANGLE THAT 5050. I KNOW SENATOR BLACKBURN OF TENNESSEE TOLD ME ON THURSDAY THAT THEY ARE DOING TEAM HERSCHEL. MAKING SURE THE SENATORS HAVE TEAM HERSCHEL ON THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA WHERE THEY CAN BUILD A WARCHEST FOR THEM. DONALD TRUMP DID THEM. THEY WERE JUST TYPICAL HUGE TRUMP RALLIES. THEY WILL NEED HIM TO SELL THE BRAND OF THE PARTY. THEY HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER WITH HIM. SOMETHING HAS TO HAPPEN.  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HERSCHEL WALKER. PEOPLE ALREADY LOOKING AT 2024. ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES THAT THE LEFT HAS. THEY PROVED IT IN THE ELECTION WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. PETE INTERVIEWED SOME YOUNG JEN AZIZ AND HERE IS WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY.  I CANNOT WAIT.  I THINK IDENTITY POLITICS HAS PLAYED A HUGE FACTOR. I ALSO THINK THAT COLLEGE CAMPUSES HAVE A BIG PART IN OUR EXTREMELY INFLUENTIAL IN HOW YOUNG VOTERS THINK.  IT IS HARD TO BE CONSERVATIVE. THE REVERSAL OF RURAL WHICH HAPPENED IN JUNE IS A TANGIBLE MOMENT WHERE PEOPLE IN MY GENERATION DECIDED WE WOULD COME OUT TO VOTE IN A POLITICAL ELECTION THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRESIDENCY. I WOULD SAY COLLEGE CAMPUS SOCIAL MEDIA ARE BIG ASPECTS FROM IT.  THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS HOW WE MANAGE, YOU KNOW, ELECTIONS, AND SOME OF THE THINGS YOU BROUGHT UP. THESE KIDS ARE GOING FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH COLLEGE GETTING ONE PERSPECTIVE ONLY AND YOU ARE AN OUTSIDER. TRULY AN OUTSIDER IF YOU HAVE THE PERSPECTIVE THESE YOUNG LADIES HAVE.  THE PARTIES WILL HAVE TO SUPPORT EVEN MORE OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE. MAKE SURE THAT THEY SHOW UP. THAT IF THERE IS A REPUBLICAN PARTY EVENT ON CAMPUS, MAYBE THE PARTY HELPS OUT BY PRINTING THE T-SHIRTS. I AM SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS SENT OUT THE ALL CALL WEEKS AGO. I HAVE MY THOUGHTS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE ARE OVER POLLING, BUT WE WILL GET INTO THAT MAY BE ANOTHER DAY. THERE IS A REASON WHY THOSE POLLS TURNED OUT TO BE PINKY. IT'S NOT THAT THEY WERE ALL WRONG, WE JUST DID NOT KNOW WHICH ONES TO BELIEVE DOWN THE STRETCH. I DO THINK IF YOU CAN GALVANIZE AND GIVE THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE SOME SUPPORT, SEE, DEMOCRATS SUPPORT EACH OTHER. THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE LAWMAKERS, JUST PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. YOU KNOW, THEY ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE POLITICAL MOVEMENT HERE. THE YOUNGER ONES, THE 18, THE 19, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TEENAGERS IF REPUBLICANS WANT TO GO FORWARD, IT IS ALL IN THE FUTURE. WHEN BERNIE SANDERS SAID WE ARE LOSING THE YOUTH VOTE, HIT THAT ABORTION, HIT THAT DEMOCRACY. THEY KNEW IT RESONATED WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEY FIGURED EVERYONE ELSE WOULD COME ALONG AND THEY WERE RIGHT.  YOUR NEW BOOK COMES OUT ON TUESDAY. FAITH STILL MOVES MOUNTAINS. THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE. CANNOT WAIT TO READ IT. BY THE WAY, IF YOU WANT A LITTLE BIT OF A PREVIEW, THERE IS A SPECIAL ON THE BOOK AIRING TONIGHT.  10:00 P.M. EASTERN PRIMETIME.  HERE IS A CLIP OF FAITH STILL MOVES MOUNTAINS. \u266a  MY MOTHER HAD ME KEEP THAT PAD, THAT JOURNAL. SHE SAID I WANT YOU TO WRITE DOWN WHAT COMES FROM YOUR HEART AND MIND ABOUT THE LORD. I WANT YOU TO NOT TALK SO MUCH WHEN YOU PRAY. BOTH OF MY PARENTS ARE VERY STRONG IN THEIR FAITH. MY MOTHER PHYSICALLY ON HER KNEES WOULD SAY I CAN STILL HEAR YOU ASKING FIRST OFF, HE IS NOT SANTA CLAUS. [LAUGHTER]  I LOVE THAT. IT IS TRUE.  I KNOW. IT IS TRUE. THE LORD REALLY DOES LEAN INTO US WILL WE LEAN INTO HIM. HE HELPS US BY HELPING US FIND OUR DIVINE ASSIGNMENT. OUR PURPOSE. HE DOESN'T THROUGH INTERVENING IN WAYS IN WHICH NO ONE ELSE CAN MAKING SURE THAT ALL OF THE RESOURCES AROUND US WORK TOGETHER FOR EACH OF US IN HIS TIMING. HE REALLY, REALLY IS STILL THAT POWERFUL AND I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE LOST THEIR FAITH, AND, LOOK, IT REALLY BOTHERED ME THAT UP BEHIND THE PANDEMIC THEY WOULD CLOSE DOWN CHURCHES AND PLACES OF PRAYER THAT THEY WOULD KEEP OPEN THE WEED DISPENSARY.  AND THE STRIP PUPS.  BECAUSE YOU NEED SOMETHING TO DEAL. THIS IS ABOUT REMINDING PEOPLE THROUGH OTHER PEOPLE'S TESTIMONIES BECAUSE THAT IS HOW WE DO IT. WE WILL GO TO CHURCH, WE ARE ARM IN ARM. DID YOU HEAR WHAT HAPPENED WITH, YOU KNOW, WENDY. BOTH OF MY BEST FRIENDS NAMES ARE WENDY. PEOPLE ARE AT THEIR WORST, AT THEIR LOWEST AND THEY DO NOT GIVE UP, OR THEY DO AND THEN THEY REMEMBERED THAT THEY DO HAVE AN ACTIVE VITAL STRATEGY TO PUSH AGAINST THE WORLD THAT WOULD RATHER WE GIVE UP THE FIGHT.  YOU CAN CHECK IT OUT. IT IS AVAILABLE THIS TUESDAY. PREORDER NOW. IT OFFICIALLY DEBUTS ON TUESDAY. THE SPECIALIST TONIGHT. 10:00 P.M. ON THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL OR STREAM IT ON FOX NATION.  EVERYWHERE BOOKS ARE SOLD. I HAVE A FEELING SHE WILL SELL A COULD JILLION COPIES. ORDER YOURS NOW.  A TIME TO HEAR ABOUT THE POWER OF PRAYER.  ABSOLUTELY.  A BILLION DOLLARS OF CONSUMER FUNDS JUST GONE. ONE CRYPTO FIRM NOW IN CHAOS. MARIA JOINED US NEXT TO BREAK IT ALL DOWN. \u266a REUTERS INVESTIGATION REVEALING $1 BILLION OF CUSTOMER MONEY HAS VANISHED FROM EMBATTLED CRYPTO CURRENCY EXCHANGE. FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY ON FRIDAY AND IS NOW MOVING ALIENS INTO OFF-LINE CRYPTO WALLETS. $500 MILLION WORTH OF CRIB NO ASSETS WERE STOLEN. I AM SO FASCINATED BY THIS STORY HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW BIG OF A DEAL THIS IS AN EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED HERE.  THANK YOU SO MUCH. THIS APPEARS TO BE FRAUD, QUITE SIMPLY. A LEHMAN BROTHERS MOMENT FOR THE CRIP NO INDUSTRY. IT DOES SPEAK TO THE IMMATURITY OF THIS INDUSTRY. WE WILL CONTINUE ZEROING IN ON EXACTLY HOW THIS HAPPENS. THIS IS THE KIND OF EVENT THAT CAN SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL AND IMPACT OTHER ASSETS AS WELL. CUSTOMER MONEY, PROOF, JUST LIKE THAT. PEOPLE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO NEXT. IF YOU ARE OUT A BILLION DOLLARS OR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN ONE PART OF YOUR PORTFOLIO, WHAT DO YOU DO TO RAISE MONEY? YOU SELL WHATEVER YOU CAN SELL. THIS COULD BE ONE OF THOSE EVENTS THAT SPIRALS OUT OF CONTROL. ON TOP OF THE FACT OF WE ARE WAITING FOR A FEDERAL RESERVE ACT. WE SEE THESE INTEREST RATES GOING HIGHER AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE RUNNING OFF WITH ITS BALANCE SHEET. THAT WILL TAKE A TRILLION DOLLARS OF LIQUIDITY OUT OF THE MARKET. WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WHICH APPEARS TO BE SIMPLE FRAUD , YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHO WAS HOLDING THAT MONEY, WHO WAS OUT OF ALL THAT MONEY, WHO ARE THE BIG INVESTORS AND WHAT WILL THEY DO NOW. AGAIN, WHEN YOU HAVE TO SELL AND YOU HAVE TO PROTECT ANOTHER PART OF YOUR PORTFOLIO, YOU SELL WHAT YOU CAN SELL. THAT IS WHY SOMETHING LIKE THIS APPEARS THAT IT IS CONFINED, LIMITED TO ONE AREA OF CRYPTO BUT THEN SUDDENLY IT IMPACTS THE BROADER MARKET BECAUSE OF THAT VERY REASON. TALKING ABOUT THE BROADER MARKET IN THE SITUATION WE ARE IN THIS ECONOMY THIS MORNING. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHAT JUST WENT DOWN WITH THESE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. I'VE PROBABLY GOT THE BEST COMMUNICATOR OUT THERE TO DISCUSS WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THIS EXPECTED RED WAVE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO SEE IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. STEPHEN MILLER. FORMER WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR WE ARE ALSO WATCHING A NAILBITER OF THIS FIGHT CONTINUE THIS MORNING . CARRIE LIKE FIGHTING FOR HER SURVIVAL. THE VERY LATEST OUT OF THE MARICOPA BALLOT SITUATION WHICH OF COURSE HAS DRAGGED ON FOR A FIFTH DAY. FLORIDA SENATOR RICK SCOTT. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS NOW WITH THE SENATE. NOW THAT WE SEE THAT IT'S LIKELY THE DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE ONE UP ON THE REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE, WHERE DOES LEADERSHIP GO NOW? A LOT OF KNIVES COMING OUT FOR MITCH MCCONNELL, KEVIN MCCARTHY. RON JOHNSON HAS BEEN STEADFAST IN HIS INVESTIGATIONS. HIS INVESTIGATION OF COVID ORIGINS, HUNTER BIDEN, THE FBI, DOJ, WHAT HAPPENS NOW? CAN HE CONTINUE THOSE INVESTIGATIONS WITHOUT HOLDING THE GAVEL? WE HAVE A BIG SHOW AND WE HAVE BREAKING NEWS.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, MARIA, FOR YOUR TIME THIS MORNING. AND AFTER THAT HONORS VETERANS MORE THAN HIS REAL ROLES.

THIS ULTRATIGHT COMPETITION TOOK FOUR DAYS TO DECIDE. OVER 75% OF VOTERS UTILIZED EARLY OR ABSENTEE VOTING THERE. WITH THIS WIN, VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS SERVES AT TIEBREAKER IN THE SENATE.

PEOPLE SHOULD GO IN WITH THE SAME INFORMATION. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS NOT ABOUT NECESSARILY PUTTING IN THE EFFORT, I THINK THERE IS JUST A BEAUTIFUL, CIVIC, UNITY MOMENT, WE TALK ABOUT HOW DIVIDED WE ARE, HAVE A NATIONAL HOLIDAY ON ELECTION DAY. LET'S LET PEOPLE, AS YOU SAID YESTERDAY, VOTE THE WHOLE WEEKEND AND THEN UP TO ELECTION DAY, THE WEEKEND BEFORE. LET'S USE PAPER BALLOTS. LET'S HAVE I.D. CARDS LIKE THEY DO IN MEXICO AND EVERY OTHER COUNTRY TAKES THEIR ELECTION SERIOUSLY. LET'S HAVE PAPER BALLOTS TO TRACK IT, TO FEEL CONFIDENT ABOUT IT, FEEL CONFIDENT IN OUR DEMOCRACY. PETE: YOU'RE RIGHT. WHEN I WAS DEPLOYED TO IRAQ, OUR JOB WAS TO SECURE ELECTIONS IN IRAQ. PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO BLOW UP POLLING STATIONS. AL QAEDA TRIED TO BLOW UP POLLING. THE PURPLE FINGER? I VOTED ONCE. I CAN PROVE I VOTED ALREADY. IF I GOT INK ON MY FINGER I CAN'T VOTE AGAIN. SIMPLE IS BETTER WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTIONS. THE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT OF THAT MOMENT IS REALLY SIGNIFICANT. WILL, YOU'RE NOT SAYING I WANT LESS PEOPLE TO VOTE. THAT IS NOT THE POINT. WILL: NO. PETE: WHAT YOU'RE SAYING VOTING SHOULD NOT BE AS SIMPLE AS ORDERING A AMAZON PACKAGE. THERE IS A LOT MORE AT STAKE WHAT YOU SHOULD BE CONSIDERING. WHETHER ITS WEEKEND ALL GO TOGETHER TO THE POLLS, ALL LEARN TOGETHER WHAT THE RESULT IS, MOST IMPORTANTLY, HAVE FAITH IN THAT RESULT. YOU WANT TO SEE A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY? IT IS WHAT WE'RE WATCHING IN ARIZONA RIGHT NOW. AS WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER PEOPLE ARE CHEATING OR NOT. BUT ALL I KNOW IS THERE ARE 265,000BALLOTS STILL HAVEN'T BEEN COUNTED. IT IS SUNDAY. IS IT CUT FOR KARI LAKE, WILL IT NOT? KATIE HOBBS IS IN CHARGE OF THE ELECTIONS THERE. HOPEFULLY IT IS ABOVEBOARD. CHARLIE KIRK SAYS SO FAR IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS. HE PAYS VERY CLOSE ATTENTION. LOOKS LIKE THE NEXT FEW DUMPS OF BALLOTS WILL BE THE TEST. IF KARI LAKE CAN GO INTO ARIZONA FIX THE ELECTION SYSTEM I THINK COULD ABOUT GIVE US HOPE, REPUBLICANS GO ON THE OFFENSE TO MAKE THIS SIMPLE. SIMPLE IS BETTER. IT MEANS FAITH IN THE SYSTEM. RACHEL: THOSE CHANGES WILL HAVE TO BE DONE VERY SOON. THE REASON I SAY THAT, THERE IS NEW GENERATION OF PEOPLE VOTING WHO THINK THIS IS NORMAL. PETE: THE NEW NORMAL. RACHEL: THINK THIS IS NORMAL, THE WAY IT IS DONE. IF YOU WAIT 10 YEARS TO DRAW THE, THEY WILL SAY, VOTER SUPPRESSION. SO I JUST THINK, I JUST THINK YOU'RE RIGHT -- PETE: I'M FOR THE PURPLE FINGER. I'M DONE. PURPLE FINKER.  I'M NOT OPPOSED TO THAT. WILL: I'M THINKING ABOUT, I'M THINKING ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS. I'M THINKING ABOUT MAN ON THE STREET JESSE WATTERS DOES, YOU ASK PERCENTAGE OF AMERICAN PEOPLE TO NAME THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE NAME THE VICE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES. RACHEL: BUT THEY STILL HAVE RIGHT TO VOTE. WILL: I'M NOT TAKING EVERYBODY'S RIGHT TO VOTE AWAY. I WANT EVERYBODY TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE. I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE VOTING FOR. PETE: HERE IS THE BALLOT, FILL IT OUT IN FRONT OF ME. HERE IS THE CHEAT SHEET WHO YOU SHOULD BE VOTING FOR. YOU'RE DONE? I'VE BEEN WATCHING. GOOD JOB. GIVE ME YOUR BALLOT. I HAND IT IN.  THAT IS BALLOT HARVESTING. WILL: RACIST OR THE GOOD GUY? RACHEL: TOTALLY. PETE: THAT IS HOW MACHINE POLITICS WORKS. RACHEL: WHAT I TOLD YOU LAST WEEK WITH YOUNG FOX INTERNS TRIED TO VOTE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK CITY, THEY SAID, IS THIS YOUR ADDRESS RIGHT HERE? COME ON. WILL: MOVE TO THIS STORY. I THINK IT IS THE COVER OF THE \"NEW YORK POST,\" IT IS HERE. COWARDLY LION. BROADWAY BOOTS, LANGUAGE INTERTERP FROM THE HIT SHOW. PETE: ANY OTHER REASON THEY BOOTED HIM? WILL: HE FILED SUIT. PETE: BECAUSE HE IS WHITE. WILL: \"THE LION KING,\" REPORTEDLY INAPPROPRIATE TO HAVE A WHITE SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER. RACHEL: THE DIRECTOR SENT EMAIL TO THE SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS, YES, HERE IS WHAT SHE SAID. THE MAJORITY OF CHARACTERS IN \"THE LION KING\" ARE BLACK ACTORS. THE CONTENT TAKES PLACE IN AFRICA. THROUGH AN AMAZING ASL PERFORMER, IS NOT A BLACK PERSON AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE REPRESENTING \"LION KING.\" NEVER MIND THAT THERE ARE WHITE PEOPLE FROM AFRICA. HERE IS THE DEAL. HE IS SUING. I REALLY HOPES HE SUES THE PANTS OFF OF THIS PRODUCTION. I DON'T THINK ANYTHING ELSE WILL CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY WE'RE ON. PETE: SOUNDS LIKE RACIAL DISCRIMINATION TO ME. SO THAT WAS AN E-MAIL SENT FROM THE SHOW ITSELF. RACHEL: CORRECT. PETE: \"THE LION KING,\" TO THE ASL, THE SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS. HERE IS THE AN EMAIL OBTAINED BY \"NEW YORK POST\" FROM THE DIRECTOR OF ASL TO KEITH JUAN AND CHRISTINA MOSTLY, TWO INTERPRETERS WITH SIGN LANGUAGE. THEY'RE EMBARRASSED BY THIS. WITH GREAT EMBARASSMENT AND APOLOGIES I'M ASKING YOU BOTH TO PLEASE BACK OUT OF INTERPRETING THE SHOW FOR US ON SUNDAY, APRIL 24th. I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER WAY OUT OF THIS. IT SEEMS LIKE THE BEST SOLUTION. SO, THE SIGN LANGUAGE GROUP WAS ASKING THESE FOLKS, WE GOT PRESSURE BECAUSE YOU'RE WHITE. WE DON'T HAVE A BETTER SOLUTION, RATHER THAN FIGHTING BACK THAT IS SUPER RACIST. RACHEL: SURE. PETE: THEY ASKED THEM TO GIVE IN. THANKFULLY THE SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER IS FIGHTING BACK. WILL: HIS NAME KEITH MANAGE HE DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER I'M WHITE OR BLACK THIS IS LATETANT. PEOPLE EXPERIENCING THIS WOE STEP FORWARD. PETE: ONE OF THE STORIES SUPER STRAIGHT FORWARD BUT YET REVEALING OF THE FACT THAT APPARENTLY, THERE ARE LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT BELIEVE IT'S OKAY TO BE RACIST IN ONE DIRECTION. WILL: THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT IS RACIST. PETE: EVEN MORE SO. THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT IS RACIST TO BE RACIST IN ONE DIRECTION. WILL: RIGHT. RACHEL: WHAT IS INTERESTING ABOUT THE EMAIL TO ME THAT, OR THE STATEMENT PUT OUT BY THE INTERPRETERS HE SAID I WISH OTHER PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCED THIS WOULD STEP FORWARD AND JOIN ME. WHO WAS IT THAT WE HAD ON THE SHOW WHO SAID, OH, LIEUTENANT SCHELLER. PETE: COLONEL SHELLER.  STEPPED FORWARD ONE GUY CALLING OUT IN AFGHANISTAN HE WAS EXPECTING TO HAVE A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE JOIN HIM. HE WAS ALONE. THAT IS THE BIGGER STORY IN THIS, MANY PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM THESE KINDS OF RACIST POLICIES WHETHER IT'S IN THEIR WORK PLACE, OR WHEREVER, AND THEY JUST STAY SILENT. THE MORE PEOPLE SPEAK UP, THE MORE FRANKLY THAT PEOPLE SUE, FRANKLY MONEY TALKS WE'LL NOT SEE A CHANGE IN THIS CULTURE. IT WILL CONTINUE TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION. WILL: I THINK HE HAS A CASE. I THINK HE HAS A CASE. RACHEL: MAYBE DEPENDS ON THE JUDGE HE GETS, FOX NEWS ALERT. TRAGEDY STRIKES AT A DALLAS AIRSHOW. SIX PEOPLE ARE FEARED DEAD AFTER A PAIR OF WORLD WAR II ERA PLANES CRASH INTO EACH OTHER. RACHEL: WHAT STARTED AS COMMEMORATION FOR VETERANS ENDED IN HORROR.

TWO HISTORIC WORLD WAR II PLANES, A BOEING B-17 FLYING FORTRESS, BELL P-17F KING COKE BRA PLANE CRASHED INTO EACH OTHER AT THE WINGS OVER DALLAS SHOW. THE AIRSHOW HONORING VETERANS DAY, ATTRACTING THOUSANDS THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND. THE CRASH CAUSING A LARGE FIRE AND SENDING PLUMES OF BLACK SMOKE INTO THE SKY. OFFICIALS SAY ONLY VOLUNTEERS WITH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE ANTIQUE PLANES WERE ONBOARD AT THE TIME OF THE CRASH. WITNESSES SAYING THEY THOUGHT THE EXPLOSION WAS PART OF THE SHOW BEFORE REALIZING THE HORROR OF WHAT TOOK PLACE.  THEN SHOCKED. CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH MY MIND. I SAW THE BLACK SMOKE, COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I WAS SEEING. REPORTER: TWO HIGHWAYS WERE CLOSED AFTER DEBRIS FROM THE CRASH FELL. INVESTIGATION INTO THE CRASH IS UNDERWAY. THE NATIONAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD IS LAUNCHING A GO TEAM AFTER A MID-AIR COLLISION BETWEEN BOEING B-17 P AND P-17F. THE B-17 WAS A CORNERSTONE OF THE UNITED STATES AERIAL STRENGTH DURING WORLD WAR II BUT MOST WERE SCRAPPED AFTER THE WAR. THE P-63 WAS A FAVORED FIGHTER PLANE OF THE SOVIET FORCES. THE AIRSHOW FEATURING MORE THAN 40 WORLD WAR II ERA PLANES. THE TRANSPORTATION SAFETY BOARD INVESTIGATORS ARE EXPECTED TO ARRIVE ON SCENE TODAY. WILL, PETE, RACHEL. WILL: AWFUL STORY. THANK YOU SO MUCH, MARIANNE. LET'S TURN TO A FEW ADDITIONAL HEADLINES. ONE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL IS GRAPPLING WITH NEARLY 1700 CASES OF THE FLU SINCE SEPTEMBER. FLU AND RESPIRATORY ILLNESS PATIENTS OVERWHELMINGLY THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM WHERE SOME HOSPITALS ARE USING OUTFLOW TENTS OUTSIDE OF EMERGENCY ROOMS. 9% OF EMERGENCY ROOP PATIENTS IN SAN DIEGO HAD FLU-LIKE SYSTEMS. ACCORDING TO COUNTY OFFICIALS THAT IS UP 2% FROM LAST WEEK. > PRESIDENT BIDEN CURRENTLY MAKING HIS WAY TO INDONESIA FOR THE G20 SUMMIT.

PRESIDENT BIDEN: FOR YEARS THEY'RE ENGAGED IN TRILATERAL COOPERATION ON SHARED TEN FOR THE FOR THE NUCLEAR, MISSILE THREATS NORTH KOREA POSES TO OUR PEOPLE.

HE CALLS OUT THE GREEN NEW DEAL, WRITING, THE GREEN NEW DEAL IS NOT A LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE BUT A COTTON CANDY MEDIA CONCOCTION. AOC RESPONDING ON TWITTER. PERHAPS DAVID BROOKS SHOULD READ THE LEGISLATION. INSULTING REFERRING TO IT AS COTTON CANDY. HE WANTS ME TO BE TRUMP BUT I'M NOT. THOSE ARE THE HEADLINES. RACHEL: WHAT? PETE: WHAT IS THAT? WILL: THE COLUMN WAS BROOKS SUGGESTING THAT BOTH TRUMP AND THE FAR LEFT HAD BEEN REJECTED IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. I THINK THE TERM HE USED THE FEVER IS BROKEN. BY SAYING SO HE EQUATED IN HER MIND AOC TO TRUMP. PETE: I FIGURED DAVID BROOKS HAD TO GET SOMETHING IN AGAINST TRUMP. RACHEL: TO TAKE A SWIPE AT AOC. PETE: EXACTLY RIGHT. RACHEL: BY THE WAY HE IS TOTALLY WRONG. HIS ANALYSIS IS WRONG. THIS CLIMATE TOUR AND THE DOUBLING DOWN ON CLIMATE POLICIES THAT JOE BIDEN IS DOING RIGHT NOW OVERSEAS AND DOMESTICALLY, YOU KNOW, KNOW COMMITTING TO ALL KINDS OF RESOURCES TO IT. SHE IS RIGHT, SHE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT BILL. ALL RIGHT. UP NEXT, A BALLOT MEASURE THAT REQUIRES DOCTORS TO PERFORM LIFE-SAVING CARE ON INFANTS WHO SURVIVE ABORTIONS FAILS IN MONTANA.

THIS AFTER VOTERS IN MONTANA REJECT A LAW THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED DOCTORS TO PERFORM LIFE HEAVY SAVING CARE ON INFANTS WHO SURVIVE ABORTIONS OR WHO ARE BORN PREMATURELY. LIVE ACTION PRESIDENT, THE AUTHOR OF FIGHTING FOR LIFE, LYLE ARE ROSE JOINS US NOW. LEILA, GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON OUR SHOW. THIS BILL WAS PASSING ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING TO SO MANY PRO-LIFERS. OVERALL THERE WERE OTHER INITIATIVES YOU TALKED ABOUT WERE SURPRISED WENT IN THE PRO-CHOICE DIRECTION. WHAT IS THE MESSAGE TO PRO-LIFERS. WHAT ARE THE LESSONS FROM THIS ELECTION FOR THE MOVEMENT?  THANKS, RACHEL. I THINK THE BIGGEST LESSON IS THAT THIS IS A RESOURCE WAR, ESPECIALLY WHEN THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT ARE DIRECT QUESTIONS THAT ARE BEFORE THE VOTERS. IN THIS ELECTION THE PRO-ABORTION SIDE SPENT OVER $400 MILLION, MILLION, ALMOST HALF A BILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS, LYING TO VOTERS ABOUT WHAT THESE REFERENDUMS WOULD ACTUALLY DO. THE PRO-LIFE SIDE IN COMPARISON SPENT, THE GOP SPENT $11 MILLION TOTAL ON PRO-LIFE MESSAGING. SO THE OUTSPENDING WAS OVER 35 TO 1 FROM THE PRO-ABORTION SIDE THAN THE PRO-LIFE SIDE. THE PRO-LIFE MESSAGE IS WINNING MESSAGE, IF PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO IT IF PEOPLE HEAR IT. WE NEED RESOURCES TO KEEP UP WITH THE OTHER SIDE. THAT IS WHAT THE FUTURE FIGHTS ARE GOING TO BE. RACHEL: 400 MILLION TO 11 MILLION. THAT IS NOT COUNTING BIG TECH AND THE WAY THEY WEIGH IN ON THESE ISSUES WITH YOUNG WOMEN AS WELL. I GUESS, LEILA THE HOPE WAS SILENCE WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT. AS MORE YOUNG WOMAN SAW THEIR BABE I ABOUT, MET THE BABY IN INCREDIBLE 4-D ULTRASOUNDS, CHILDREN MET THEIR SIBLINGS THESE WAYS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A PRO-LIFE GENERATION. YOU SAY THERE IS MORE WORK TO DO IN THE CULTURE AND ALSO IN SPENDING?  YES, EXACTLY. THE SCIENCE IS ON OUR SIDE. WE KNOW IT'S A BABY. THE PRO-LIFE MESSAGE POLLS VERY WELL. I MEAN WHEN VOTERS ARE ASKED AS AN EXAMPLE TO SUPPORT THE HEARTBEAT LAW TO SAY THEY OPPOSE ABORTION WHEN THE BABY'S HEART TO BE DETECTED JUST THREE TO FIVE WEEKS, THE MOST AMERICANS ACTUALLY SUPPORT THE \"HEARTBEAT BILL.\" SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW THE VOTERS HEAR THE MESSAGE. PRO-ABORTION SIDE LIED ABOUT WHAT THESE REFERENDUMS ACTUALLY DID. YOU MENTIONED MONTANA. PEOPLE WERE TOLD THAT WOMEN WOULDN'T GET HEALTH CARE, WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE MEDICAL CARE. THAT BABIES THAT WERE JUST BEING GIVEN PALLIATIVE CARE, BABIES THAT WERE BORN ALIVE AND HAD SURVIVED YOU KNOW, TERRIBLE FEET TALL DIAGNOSES, THAT SOMEHOW THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET PROPER CARE IF THE LAW WENT INTO EFFECT, PRO-LIFE LAW. THESE WERE OUTRIGHT LAWS ABOUT THE LAW. A LOT WOULD SAVE BABIES WHO SURVIVED ABORTION ATTEMPTS F THEY'RE HEARING THE LIES, FIVE, 10, 15 TIMES, NOT HEARING ANY TRUTH ABOUT THE PRO-LIFE SIDE, PEOPLE MAY VOTE THE OTHER WAY. WE HAVE TO DOUBLE DOWN ON EDUCATION WHICH IS WHAT LIVE ACTION FOCUSES ON. WE REACH PEOPLE, ABOUT 15 MILLION PEOPLE A WEEK, NOW, RACHEL. WE NEED TO DOUBLE AND TRIPLE THAT IN YEARS TO COME. RACHEL: YOU HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB STEPPING FOOT INTO THE CULTURE. I SAW YOU WERE A GUEST ON DR. PHIL'S. SEEING PRO-LIFE VOICES IN THOSE KIND OF VENUES IS REALLY POWERFUL. YOU'RE GREAT THE WAY YOU HANDLED THAT. HERE IS A STATE FROM THE GROUP COMPASSION FOR MONTANA FAMILIES. MONTANANS DEMAND THE RIGHT TO MAKE PRIVATE HEALTH CARE DECISIONS FOR OURSELVES WITH OUR FAMILIES WITH THE HELP OF TRUSTED MEDICAL TEAMS AND WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM POLITICIANS. THAT IS WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THE BILL. YOU AND I BOTH MET MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE SURVIVED ABORTIONS, LEILA, IT IS REALLY AN INCREDIBLE THING THIS BILL DID THIS. ANYWAY, I CERTAINLY WOULD TAKE A LACKLUSTER MIDTERM FOR THE WIN OF PRO-ROE V. WADE. THANK YOU, LILA FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING.  THANK YOU, RACHEL. RACHEL: OF COURSE.

PETE: MORE YOUNG VOTERS ARE HEADING TO THE POLLS, ACCORDING TO THE CENTER FOR INFORMATION AND RESEARCH ON CIVIC LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT, SAY THAT FIVE TIMES FAST. 27% OF AMERICANS AGED 18 TO 29 CAST A BALLOT THIS YEAR. THAT IS THE SECOND HIGHEST YOUTH TURNOUT IN ANY MIDTERM. SEEMS LOW BUT HISTORICALLY IT'S HIGH. BUT WITH THE MAJORITY OF YOUNG PEOPLE SAYING THEY GET THEIR INFORMATION FROM SOCIAL MEDIA COULD THERE BE A DANGEROUS IMPACT FROM THAT? CALI AND MELISSA ARE CAMPUS REFORM CORRESPONDENTS, GEN SEERS, AND JOIN US NOW. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE, CALI. WE SEE THE NUMBERS. WE'LL MENTION THIS TO, YOUR AGE GROUP IN 2022 WENT OVERWHELMINGLY FOR DEMOCRATS. OVER 11 POINTS HIGHER FOR DEMOCRATS THAN PUB REPUBLICANS WHERE ARE THEY GETTING THEIR INFORMATION FROM WHEN THEY'RE VOTING FOR?  AS A GEN ZER MYSELF THEY GET INFORMATION FROM SOCIAL MEDIA, NOT AS MUCH CABLE NEWS, MAJOR NEWSPAPERS, MAJOR PUBLICATIONING BUT PEOPLE GIVING RANDOM OPINIONS ON INTERNET LIKE TWITTER, FOR SOME PEOPLE LIKE FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM AND SO ON. THOSE INSTITUTIONS LEAN VERY LEFT. I'M NOT THAT SURPRISED WITH THE WAY MY GENERATION CAME OUT TO VOTE TUESDAY. PETE: IS TIKTOK A PART OF THAT WHEN IT COMES TO SOCIAL MEDIA?  UNFORTUNATELY. UNFORTUNATELY. I TRY NOT TO GIVE CREDIT BUT THAT IS TRUE. PETE: I HEARD THE KIDS TALKING ABOUT IT, SO I HAD TO ASK. MELISSA, FOR YOU AS WELL, HOW ABOUT IF THEY'RE GETTING IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA WHAT IS THE CONVERSATION LIKE? WHAT, WHAT KALA SAID IS TRUE. 48% OF YOUNG ADULTS ARE GETTING THEIR NEWS FROM SOCIAL MEDIA. 21% FROM NEWS WEBSITES. CABLE TV AT 7%. SO IT IS SOCIAL MEDIA. WHAT ARE THE MESSAGES THEY'RE SEEING?  I THINK THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BEEN LABELED A CERTAIN WAY. THEY HAVE BEEN LABELED FASCIST, TRANSPHOBIC, SEXIST, RACIST. ALL THESE LABELS WORKED AGAINST UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. IDENTITY POLITICS HAS PLAYED A HUGE FACTOR HOW THE GEN-Z DEMOGRAPHIC HAS VOTED IN MIDTERM 2022 ELECTIONS. I ALSO THINK THAT COLLEGE CAMPUSES HAVE A BIG PART IN OUR EXTREMELY INFLUENCAL HOW YOUNG VOTERS THINK. I THINK, AS WE SEE ON LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE'S CAMPUS REFORM WE SEE THAT THESE STUDENTS ARE BEING INDOCTRINATED, NOT EDUCATED. THEY'RE NOT UNDERSTANDING THE BASIC CONCEPT LIKE FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENTS, OUR BASIC ECONOMIC CONCEPTS TO APPLY THEM, ACTUALLY VOTE FOR THINGS THAT ARE TRULY IMPORTANT TO AMERICANS. PETE: ON THAT NOTE, SO ON SOCIAL MEDIA IT IS OVERWHELMINGLY LEFT OF CENTER BUT THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GETTING TODAY MOVES THEM IN THAT DIRECTION AS WELL, RIGHT?  ABSOLUTELY TRUE. IT IS REALLY HARD TO BE A CONSERVATIVE OR ANYTHING CENTER RIGHT ON CAMPUS RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY I WOULD SAY SINCE THE REVERSAL OF ROE HAPPENED IN JUNE I THINK A TANGIBLE MOMENT WHERE PEOPLE IN MY GENERATION DECIDED THAT WE'RE GOING TO COME OUT TO VOTE IN A POLITICAL ELECTION THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRESIDENCY. SO I WOULD SAY THAT COLLEGE CAMPUS, SOCIAL MEDIA ARE BIG ASPECTS OF IT. AND SPECIFIC POLITICAL ISSUES THAT SOCIAL MEDIA AND OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES PUSHED FOR WHICH IS PRO-CHOICE AGENDA OR PRO-ABORTION AGENDA REGARDING REVERSAL OF ROE V. WADE. PETE: INTERESTING POINT. WHALE SHE WAS TALKING SHOWING VIDEOS OF POLITICIANS ON TIKTOK, MAKING TIKTOK VIDEOS, DOES THAT WORK? I LOOK AT THAT, WHO FALLS FOR THAT? DO YOUNG PEOPLE SAY THESE POLITICIANS ARE COOL, THEREFORE THEIR POLICIES MUST BE GOOD?  BECAUSE OF IGNORANCE, LACK OF EDUCATION OF GEN-ZERS THEY FALL FOR THIS TACTIC. THAT IS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO GAIN INTEREST IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THIS HAS AN APPEAL TO THEM IT MAY NOT HAVE FOR ANY OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE SEE THE ONLINE SO OFTEN. ALONG WITH THE FACT THAT THEY'RE PUSHING FOR AN AGENDA THAT TAKES OFF ACCOUNTABILITY AND IT IS JUST SOMETHING THAT'S COMFORTABLE OR CONVENIENT FOR GEN-ZERS BUT DOESN'T REALLY HELP THE REST OF AMERICANS LIKE LEGALIZATION, ACCESS TO ABORTION, OPEN BORDERS. THEY'RE NOT REALIZING THE TRUE ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING MOST AMERICANS. THEY'RE NOT LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK. PETE: OR STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS WILL NOT HAPPEN, BECAUSE IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, TO A YOUNG PERSON WHO DOESN'T WANT TO PAY THEIR LOANS. THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR INSIGHT TODAY, FOR BEING THE EXCEPTION TO YOUR GENERATION RIGHT NOW. KEEP UP THE COURAGE WHERE YOU'RE AT, APPRECIATE IT.  THANK YOU. PETE: MAN, WE BETTER LEARN THESE LESSONS.  THANKS FOR HAVING US. PETE: OR GET GOOD AT TIKTOK. I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT. AFRICAN NATIONS EXPERIENCE THE WORST CRISIS IN 40 YEARS, JOE BIDEN THINKS THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS CLIMATE CHANGE. HIS 150 MILLION-DOLLAR PLEDGE TO PUSH A GREEN AGENDA ON AFRICA. PLUS THERE IS NOTHING MORE AMERICAN THAN THIS, A FATHER DEPLOYED OVERSEASES SURPRISES HIS FAMILY DURING A FOOTBALL GAME.

THIS BY THE RESULT OF LAST NIGHT, WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO DIFFERENTLY TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S OPINION OF THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY PARTICULARLY AS YOU CONTEMPLATE A RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2,024?  President Biden: NOTHING. THEY HAVE YET TO FIND OUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING. THE MORE THEY FIND OUT WHAT WE ARE DOING THE MORE SUPPORT THERE IS. ASHLEY: PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID FULL SPEED AHEAD WITH THE AGENDA, 75% OF MIDTERM VOTERS, THE VOTER ANALYSIS THE COUNTRY IS HEADED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. DID DEMOCRAT LEARN ANY LESSONS FROM THE ELECTION OUTCOME AND SHOULD THEY? LET'S ASK STRATEGIST DOUG SH SHOEN. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. JERRY: IT IS FULL SPEED AHEAD WITH HIS AGENDA. WON'T BE FULL SPEED AHEAD, REPUBLICANS HAVE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES TO STOP HIS AGENDA. WHAT'S THE LARGER MESSAGE WE SHOULD BE TAKING FROM THE PRESIDENT'S DETERMINATION THAT HE'S GOT NOTHING WRONG IN THE VOTE ON TUESDAY WAS AN ENDORSEMENT.  A VERY DEPRESSING CONCLUSION WE REACH BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE LESSON OF DIVIDED GOVERNMENT FROM THE BILL CLINTON ERA AND OTHER ERRORS IS YOU NEED TO COOPERATE AND COMPROMISE. IT WILL REQUIRE COOPERATION AND THE PRESIDENT SAID I WILL TALK TO KEVIN MCCARTHY AND THE REPUBLICANS BUT HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO THEM MUCH. I THINK PRESIDENT BIDEN FAILED TO TAKE THE LARGER MESSAGE AS PAT TOOMEY SAID EARLIER THAT THIS WAS A VOTE AGAINST DONALD TRUMP, NADA VOTE FOR MORE POLARIZATION AND CONFRONTATION OF THE TYPE PRESIDENT BIDEN IMPLIED WE ARE GOING TO GET. JERRY: PRESIDENT CLINTON REACHED OUT AND GOT A LOT OF BIPARTISAN THINGS DONE. WHAT IS THE PROSPECT WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN? WILL HE TRY AND THEY MIGHT DO A DEAL, MAYBE ON ENERGY AND IMMIGRATION, ANY COMMON GROUND?  THERE IS POSSIBLE COMMON GROUND, TWO WISHES WE COULD DO IN ALL IN POLICY ON ENERGY, DO SOLAR, WIND, ELECTRIC CARS, BUT CONTINUE WITH FOSSIL FUELS, COAL, LIKE. I DON'T THINK IT WILL HAPPEN. WE COULD DO A DEAL ON IMMIGRATION, BORDER SECURITY AND HAVE A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP TO THOSE PLAYING BY THE RULES, DON'T THINK IT WILL HAPPEN. I AM DISAPPOINTED IN THAT. I THOUGHT THE PRESIDENT DREW THE WRONG MESSAGE, THE WRONG MESSAGE FOR DEMOCRATS HEADING INTO 2024, THE REPUBLICANS WON THE POPULAR VOTE BY 3 OR 4 POINTS AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LANDMASS OF THE UNITED STATES VOTED RED, NOT BLUE. JERRY: WE TALKED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICANS WHICH HOW IMPORTANT WAS THE ABORTION ISSUE? THAT WAS GOING INTO THE ELECTION, WE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT BUT DID SEEM OVERWHELMED IN TERMS OF INFLATION AND THE ECONOMY. SEVERAL STATES WHERE ABORTION WAS ON THE BALLOT, PRO CHOICE OPTION ONE EVERYWHERE, THAT MAY HAVE HELPED IN KEY GOVERNORS RACES. WHAT IS YOUR SENSE HOW IMPORTANT THAT WAS?  I THINK YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. ABORTION, WHICH MOST OBSERVERS THOUGHT WOULD BE A LESSER ISSUE WAS ALMOST AS IMPORTANT OF VOTERS IN THE EXIT POLLS AS INFLATION. THAT, I THINK, INDICATES THAT THE DEMOCRATIC VOTE WAS IN LARGE PART MEASURED BY A REACTION TO THE DOBBS DECISION, NOT REALLY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION POLICIES WHICH AS YOU AND OTHERS POINTED OUT, WERE NOT AT ALL POPULAR AND REMAIN UNPOPULAR. JERRY: LET'S TALK WHERE DEMOCRATS LOST GROUND, AMONG LATINOS. REPUBLICANS HAD THEIR BEST SHOWING, RON DESANTIS DID WELL, THE LATINO VOTE DID SEEM TO SWING SIGNIFICANTLY TOWARDS REPUBLICANS, IS THAT A LARGER TREND WE ARE SEEING? THAT WE CAN EXPECT BE A DOMINANT FACTOR?  VERY MUCH A LARGER TREND. OF THE REPUBLICANS ATTEMPT TO BE MORE THEM CORROSIVE -- INCLUSIVE IN RHETORIC AND POLICIES THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO BUILD THE KIND OF PERMANENT MAJORITY THEY ARE SEEKING, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN MINORITIES FOR GRANTED FOR A VERY LONG TIME, PLAYING IDENTITY POLITICS. I WOULD TELL YOU, I SEE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE REPUBLICANS, AND IN A DISTINCT AND I WOULD SAY ALMOST DYING MINORITY TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE PARTY AND THE COUNTRY. JERRY: PRESIDENT BIDEN INDICATED HE DOES INTEND TO RUN. I THINK THAT WOULD BE PRESSURE ON HIM GIVEN HIS AGE, BUT DO YOU THINK THAT IS LIKELY, WHY HE WOULD BE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE NEXT TIME.  HE'S CLEARLY EMBOLDENED AND I BELIEVE HE WILL RUN, HE WILL RUN AS LONG AS HE CAN, HIS HEALTH ALLOWING HIM TO DO SO. TO BE THE NOMINEE. JERRY: THANKS VERY MUCH.

ONE ALLEGED REASON FOR THE DELA IS THE SIGNATURE VERIFICATION PROCESS OF THE COUNTY'S MAIL IN BALLOTS WHICH REQUIRES THAT POL WORKERS MATCH THE VOTER SIGNATURE ON THE AFFIDAVIT ENVELOPE WITH THE SIGNATURE AND THE VOTER REGISTRATION DATABASE AS THE VEGAS REVIEW JOURNAL COLUMNIST VICTOR JAKES REVEALED IN HIS COLUMN THAT WAS JUST PUBLISHED YESTERDAY, THE PROCES IS FAR FROM FULL PROOF, HE TESTED THE PROCESS BY WRITING THE NAMES OF 11 VOTERS BEFORE HAVING THEM COPY HIS SIGNATURE ONTO THEIR ENVELOPES IN HIS HANDWRITING LOOKING NOTHING LIK THEIR HANDWRITING. THE PROCESS FOR HIS TEST HE SAY IS LEGAL AS THE VOTERS WERE THE ONES THAT SIGNED THEIR OWN NAME TO THE ENVELOPE. SCARILY ENOUGH DESPITE THE SIGNATURE IS NOT MATCHING THOSE IN THE DATABASE, SIX OF THE BALLOTS WERE IN FACT UPSET NOW EVERY BOREAL JOURNAL COLUMNIST IS WITH US. I ASSUMED YOU CHECKED IT LEGALLY , THEY ARE THE ONES THAT SIGNED THE BALLOTS THEY CAN SIG ANYWAY THEY WANT, CORRECT? TO GET THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S WHA THE LAW SAYS AS LONG AS THE VOTER IS SIGNING IT, IT IS ALL LEGAL. THE OTHER POINT IS, THESE ARE THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE AHEAD OF TIME ESPECIALLY AS MALE INVALIDS COME IN AND STATES HAV DIFFERENT RULES. YOU HAVE TO AGREE WITH ME THAT WHAT IS GOING ON IN NEVADA RIGH NOW IS PATHETIC. YOU AGREE THAT HERE IT IS FRIDA NIGHT AND WE ARE GETTING DROPS FROM ARIZONA, WE ARE EXPECTING ANY MOMENT FROM NEVADA. IT INSANE TO ME. YOU AGREE THE SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING.  IT'S AN ABSOLUTE EMBARRASSMENT AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER, FLORIDA COUNTED 7 MILLION VOTES IN A MATTER OF HOURS AND HERE WE ARE IN NEVADA AND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE 7 MILLIO PEOPLE WE ARE A POPULATION OF 3 MILLION PEOPLE FOR DAYS LATER WE STILL DON'T KNOW WHO WON ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT U.S. SENATE RACES IN THE COUNTRY AND THAT SHOULD BE ABSOLUTELY EMBARRASSING FOR THE STATE AND IT SHOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE TO LEADERS OF BOTH PARTIES. UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T THINK IT IS. AGAIN I DON'T THINK IT IS EITHER . IT IS INTERESTING THAT PEOPLE WANT VOTING IN PERPETUITY, LET' PUT FOR TWO MONTHS BEFORE THE ELECTION. I WOULD PREFER ONE DAY OF VOTING . AT ON THINK A SINGLE VOTE SHOUL BE CAST BEFORE ALL THE DEBATES TAKE PLACE. I WOULD SAY IS SIGNATURE VERIFICATION CAN WORK IF IT'S DONE PROPERLY, BUT THE MORE IMPORTANT THING FOR ME AND DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT THAT WOULD BE VOTER ID. WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WANT DON'T WANT VOTER ID? IF YOU WANT TO VISIT A CONGRESSMAN, DON'T YOU NEED AN ID TO GET INTO THE CAPITAL?  THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. SHOWING YOUR ID IS A NORMAL PAR OF BEING AN ADULT AND PEOPLE DO IT ALL THE TIME WITHOUT COMPLAINTS. IT IS REALLY HARD TO FATHOM THE REASON WHY DEMOCRATS OPPOSE THI SO MUCH. IT'S POSSIBLE THEY THINK OH, IT'S AN ISSUE WE COULD USE TO DEMAGOGUE REPUBLICANS ABOUT IT AND SCORE AN ELECTORAL ADVANTAGE , BUT IT IS SURPRISING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE SIGNATURE VERIFICATION, IT'S JUST NOT AS ACCURATE AS DOING SOMETHING LIKE REQUIRING VOTERS TO PUT THE LAST FOUR DIGITS OF THEIR SAY DRIVERS LICENSE ON THEIR MEAL BALLOTS, THAT WOULD BE A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER. SIGNATURES CHANGE OVER TIME.  I CAN TELL YOU, YOU COULD SE 40, 50, 100 DIFFERENT VARIATION OF MY SIGNATURE DEPENDING ON TH SITUATION, I MIGHT GO REALLY QUICK LIKE THIS BECAUSE I'M GIVING OUT A LOT OF SIGNATURES AT ONE TIME. VICTOR, THANK YOU FOR BEING WIT US. PRETTY COURAGEOUS EXPERIMENT ON YOUR PART. THE SENATE RACES IN ARIZONA WE ARE EXPECTING ANY MOMENT NOW APPARENTLY THERE ARE DROPS COMING IN, BUT ONLY SMALL ONES. WE WILL PUT THEM ON THE SCREEN IN SI CAN. BOTH IN ARIZONA AND NEVADA, THE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES WITHOUT A DECLARED WINNER TONIGHT. ALASKA'S RACE REMAINS UNDECIDED AT THE MOMENT. A WINNER LIKELY WON'T BE DECLARED WE ARE TOLD UNTIL LATE NOVEMBER BECAUSE OF THEIR INSAN RANKED CHOICE VOTING SYSTEM THA ALLOWS VOTERS TO RANK EVERY CANDIDATE IN EACH ROUND THE CANDIDATE WITH THE FEWEST VOTES IS ELIMINATED. WHEN A CANDIDATE IS ELIMINATED THE VOTERS NEXT CHOICE IS AWARDED TO VOTE AND THE RESULTS ARE THEN RECALCULATED UNTIL ONL TO REMAIN. THIS PROCESS IS EXPECTED TO TAK WEEKS WITH THE AP REPORTING THA ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF COUNTING ONES EVEN BEGIN UNTIL NOVEMBER 23RD. HERE WITH REACTION. I ACTUALLY CALLED THE INCUMBENC PROTECTION RANKING SYSTEM OF VOTING, AM I WRONG ON THAT?  YOU ARE CORRECT. THIS WAS PUT IN PLACE BY HER LIES IN HER CAMPAIGN STAFF THAT WAS THIS EXPOSED IT UNDERCOVER VIDEO SPREAD WE KNOW THE SYSTEM WAS RIGGED IN HER FAVOR. IT'S A GREAT HONOR AND I'M HUMBLED AT THIS POINT THAT ALASKANS HAVE VOTED FOR ME TO HAVE THE LEAD IN THIS RACE OVER A 21 YOUR INCOME BEND. IT AS CLEAR THAT ALASKANS HAVE GOTTEN THAT MESHES THROUGH. WE HAVE HAD DOUBLE DEFINITE UPHILL BATTLE AND I'M THRILLED TO HAVE THEIR SUPPORT IT WOULD BE GREAT.  TO DC AND TO SUPPORT THEM IN THAT WAY.  THERE WAS ANOTHER REPUBLICAN ON THE BALLOT THAT BOWED OUT AN ENDORSED YOU. THINK THAT CANDIDATE GOT CLOSE TO 3 PERCENT OF THE VOTE, SOMEWHERE AROUND THERE?  HE HAS ABOUT 3 PERCENT OF TH VOTE AND WE'RE NOT EVEN THROUGH ROUND ONE, SO WE DON'T HAVE THE FINAL TARA TALLY OF WHERE WE SIT , THIS WILL BE A LENGTHY PROCESS AND WE NEED TO MAKE SUR THERE AREN'T ANY GAMES PLAYED PLAY. WE NEED RESOURCES FOR MALLET OBSERVERS. HOPEFULLY WILL WE GET TO LEVEL TWO, WHEN HIS BALLOTS DROP OFF, WE ARE HOPING TO PICK AS MANY O THE SECOND-PLACE VOTES AS POSSIBLE. WE HAVE A STRONG PATHWAY TO VICTORY STILL. SO YOU HAVE THEN THE NEXT CANDIDATE, THE ONE THAT WILL BE ELIMINATED AS A DEMOCRAT THEY GOTTEN PERCENT OF THE VOTE. CORRECTLY IF I'M WRONG, I THINK IT'S WITH JOE BIDEN 56 PERCENT OF THE TIME?  THAT IS CORRECT VERY CHEAP MOSTLY VOTES DEMOCRAT SHE SUPPORTED ALL OF HIS JUDGES AND HIS RADICAL ENVIRONMENTALIST NOMINEES, THESE DEMOCRATS THAT VOTED THE DEMOCRAT FIRST, THESE MIGHT BE PRINCIPAL DEMOCRATS WH AREN'T GOING TO VOTE FOR A REPUBLICAN BECAUSE WE SAW IN TH PRIMARY AND IN THE GENERAL.  SO SHE VOTES WITH THE DEMOCRATS, SO IN ALL LIKELIHOOD A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF HER 10 PERCENT OF THE VOTES, THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE GETTING OUT , I DOUBT THEY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE A REAL CONSERVATIVE AND THEY WILL END UP VOTING FOR LISA MURKOWSKI . THAT TO ME IS UNFAIR TO THE PEOPLE OF ALASKA THEY GAVE YOU THE MOST VOTES ON ELECTION DAY.  THAT IS HOW THE SYSTEM IS. AT THE DEMOCRATS ALSO MIGHT NOT VOTE FOR ANYBODY SECOND-PLACE. THAT'S ALSO AN OPTION. THEY COULD BE PARTYLINE DEMOCRATS THEY DON'T WANT A REPUBLICAN ADELE. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP FROM THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDAT WHEN SHE SUPPORTS LIMITS ON ABORTIONS AND SHE SUPPORTED ALL OF THE JUSTICES THAT OVERTURNED ROE VERSUS WADE. SO WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS SITTIN BEHIND CANDIDATE THREE AND FOUR. WE STILL HAVE VICKI STRONG PATHWAY TO VICTORY. I LOVE THE STATE OF ALASKA. BUT THIS SYSTEM YOU ALL HAVE IN ALASKA IS PROBABLY THE DUMBEST SYSTEM I HAVE EVER SEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I SUGGEST STRONGLY THAT YOU CHANGE IT BECAUSE OTHERWISE, THIS WILL CONTINUE. IT IS CRAZY. GOOD LUCK AS THIS CONTINUES, WE WILL FOLLOW IT ALL THE WAY TO CHRISTMAS. STRAIGHT AHEAD, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO EMBARRASS AMERICA. AND HIMSELF ON THE WORLD STAGE FRIGHT WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE HIS LATEST WONDERS FROM HIS TRIP TO EGYPT.ver. ALL OF THE LITTLE LIGHTS ARE STRAIGHT AHEAD. 20221112023610.768|20221112024014.194",

        "trs": "\u266a  Sean: PRESIDENT BIDEN IN EGYPT AT A BIG CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE TODAY AND AS YOU WOULD EXPECT, HE'S DOING A GOOD JOB OF EMBARRASSING HIMSELF AND OUR COUNTRY ON THE WORLD STAGE. TAKE A LOOK FOR YOU THE INTERNATIONAL AGENCY INCLUDED THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE INVESTMENT WOULD QUOTE HELP TURBOCHARGE TURBOCHARGE THE EMERGING CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY. KNOWS READ IN A THE QUOTE, SORRY . IT'S OKAY, JOE. WE EXPECT IT. IN BETWEEN GAPS, HE ANNOUNCED HIS PLEDGE TO CONTRIBUTE GET THIS, 11.4 BILLION TAXPAYER DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO THE GREEN CLIMATE FUND WHICH FINANCES CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTS IN POOR AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES INCLUDING EVEN CHINA AND INDIA. BECAUSE THEY TESTIFY CHINA AND INDIA IS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THIS IS MADNESS. HERE WITH REACTION FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTORS OCASIO-CORTEZ FLEISCHER AND JASON SHE FITS IN WITH US. I DON'T THINK THESE RECORD HIGH GAS PRICES REALLY CARE TO SPEND $11.4 BILLION ANNUALLY TO HELP OTHER COUNTRIES WITH THEIR CLIMATE AGENDA.  IT IS JUST CHINA IS JUST THI THIRD WORLD DEVELOPING COUNTRY. GIVE ME A BREAK. THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT GAV $300 BILLION JUST IN THEIR SLUS FUND THAT THEY CAN SPEND ON THESE GREEN CLIMATE INITIATIVES. IF WE GET A NEW CONGRESS, IF TH REPUBLICANS TRULY TAKE CONTROL THEY CONTROL THE POWER OF THE PURSE AND THEY HAVE TO CLAW ALL THAT MONEY BACK BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND CONGRESS AR NOT AUTHORIZING $11 BILLION ANNUALLY TO GO TO THESE PEOPLE. IT IS ONE OF THE BEST THINGS BY THE WAY THAT DONALD TRUMP DID WAS GET AS OUT OF THAT PARIS CLIMATE ACCORD. TO GET LOOK BACK AT THIS ELECTION AND LET'S GET YOUR ANALYSIS OF THIS AND OF COURSE THE VOTING MADNESS WE SEE UNFOLDING IN NEVADA AND ALASKA AND ARIZONA.  I DIDN'T SEE IT COMING. I WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT SAW A RED WAVE BASED ON HISTORY BASED ON JOE BIDEN'S POPULARITY APPROVAL RATING THE FACT THAT 7 WERE ON THE WRONG TRACK. ALL OF THAT ENDS UP TO THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT HAVING A BA FIRST TERM. I WANT TO POINT OUT, THEY ARE STILL GOING TO LOSE SEATS IN TH HOUSE. REPUBLICANS AREN'T DOING AS WEL AS WE HOPED THE DEMOCRATS OF LOST SEATS IN THE HOUSE. I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT IN 2008 AND DONALD TRUMP'S FIRST MIDTERM REPUBLICANS GAINED TWO SEATS IN THE SENATE HEARD THERE IS A SILVERLINING. IF THE DEMOCRATS HAD LOST THE HOUSE AND LOST THE SENATE, THE DEMOCRATS WOULD WHITE RISE UP AND DEMAND THAT JOE BIDEN NOT RUN FOR REELECTION. WE WILL HAVE AN 80 TWO-YEAR-OLD DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE. JOE BIDEN HAS NOT BEEN STRONGER HE IS GETTING OLDER.  THE PROBLEM IS WE'RE GOING T HAVE HIS POLICIES IN PLACE AND THERE WILL BE NO CHANGES OR ADJUSTMENTS AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OUR SUFFERING GREATLY. YOUR RIGHT FOUNDATIONAL WAY, AL OF THOSE ELEMENTS NORMALLY WOUL FIT A PARTICULAR PATTERN, BUT I'M HAVING A HARD TIME ONE THIN I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THI COMPREHENDING HOW REPUBLICANS CAN WIN A POPULAR VOTE FOR THE HOUSE BY 6 MILLION VOTES ACCORDING TO THE LATEST ESTIMATES I SAW, BUT NOT PICK U THAT MANY MORE SEATS, ENOUGH TO BE IN THE MAJORITY, BUT NOT MOR BEYOND THAT. WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THAT? I THINK WHAT HAPPENED HERE AS W WENT AND WON A LOT OF SEATS BY HUGE MARGIN, BUT IT WE LOST SO MANY OF THE CLOSE RACES BY A VERY SMALL MARGIN. THAT IS THE PROBLEM FOR THE OTHER ISSUE AND I LOOK THIS UP IN 2018, THE LAST MIDTERM, 12 PERCENT OF THE VOTERS WERE INDEPENDENT, THIS YEAR IS JUST TUPLES IN AMERICA WHERE IT ALMOST DOESN'T MATTER IF SOMEON CANNOT SPEAK ARTICULATELY IF THEY HAVE A D AFTER THEIR NAME THE VOTERS ARE FOR AFTER THAT IMPAIRED THERE ARE SO LITTLE TICKET SPLITTING LEFT IN AMERICA . I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO THAT I YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE A RUBBERSTAMP, THEY WILL TAKE YOU. JASON J FITZ, I ALSO THINK THE ISSUE OF ABORTION PLATE OUT BIG TIME WITH THE GUBERNATORIAL RAC IN PENNSYLVANIA WHERE THE REPUBLICAN LOST BY 14 POINTS. TUTOR DIXON I THINK WOULD HAVE GIVEN GRETCHEN WITMER RUN FOR HER MONEY HAD SHE HAD THE EXCEPTIONS FOR FOR THE MOTHER'S LIFE. BUT NEITHER HAD THOSE POSITIONS VERY DO YOU THINK THAT WAS A FACTOR?  I AM MAPPED ABOUT THOSE RESULTS AND REPUBLICANS BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW DEMOCRATS PLAY THE GAME. THEY LEVERAGE UNIONS, THEY TAKE NOT FOR PROFITS, THEY, THEY CAN WORK ON IT 365 DAYS A YEAR. THEY GO THROUGH AND DO THIS ALL THE TIME GREATLY GET THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT BIDEN SIGNED MARCH 10TH OF LAST YEAR. IT WAS ORDER 14019. THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER LEVERAGE THE ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT T SAY YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU NEED TO GET OUT THE VOTE. USE FEDERAL FACILITIES IN FEDERAL EMPLOYEES TO GO OUT AND GET PEOPLE TO REGISTER TO VOTE AND THEN WHEN YOU TRY TO SEE WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS DOING, THEY ARE CLAIMING EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE. WHAT WE'RE THOSE PLANS, THEY AL BENEFIT DEMOCRATS. 99 PERCENT OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES.  HOW MUCH OF THIS RESULT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN THE WAY AMERICA NOW VOTES, VOTING EARLY, VOTING BY MAIL?  HAS ASPIRATES.  HOW MUCH OF THAT HAS IMPACTE THIS VERY JASON, GIVE ME A QUIC ANSWER.  A LOT OF IT'S BRIGHT I WISH COULD GIVE YOU A PERCENTAGE, BU LOOK AT QUESTION THREE IN NEVAD THEY'RE GOING TO MOVE TO A RANKED CHOICE VOTING LIKE ALEXI GET DEBRIS DEMOCRATS DID THE THEY GET BALLOT INITIATIVES TO DRAW PEOPLE TO THE POLLS PRAYER.  HOW MUCH BECAUSE OF EARLY VOTING, HOW MUCH OF THAT IS IMPACTING THE RESULTS OF THESE ELECTIONS?  I DON'T THINK IT HAS. I DON'T LIKE IT BECAUSE I WOULD RATHER HAVE ONE ELECTION DAY AN WE ALL KNOW IT'S ON THAT SAME DAY IT'S A NATIONAL DAY, BUT WE ARE STILL A NATION OF ONE MAN AND ONE VOTE. WITH YOU VOTED BY MAIL OR WHETHER YOU SHOWED UP IN PERSON.  OUR DEMOCRATS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF IT AND ARE THEY USING IT BETTER THAN REPUBLICAN ARE? I THINK THE ANSWER IS OVERWHELMINGLY YES.  THEN REPUBLICAN SHOULD DO TH SAME.  THAT'S THE ONLY ANSWER? IT SHOULD BE DAY OF VOTING, PAPER BALLOTS, COUNTED, WATCH THE VOTE. EVERYBODY WATCHES A. DONE. GET THE RESULTS THAT NIGHT. COMING UP, THE GEORGIA SENATE RACE HEADED TO A RUNOFF AND GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP HITTING THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WITH HERSCHEL WALKER. WE HAVE THOSE DETAILS STRAIGHT AHEAD. 20221112024954.573|20221112025212.678",

        "trs": "\u266a  I'M NOT SURE I BELIEVE THE POLLS. YOU GIVE ME THE POWER TO ASK THE QUESTION THE WAY I WANT, I WILL GIVE YOU WHATEVER RESPONSE YOU WOULD LIKE.  LIKE THE ELECTION, IS THERE A DISCONNECT THAT THE POLLS ARE NOT SHOWING?  WELL, THE POLLS AREN'T GOD, AS WE LEARNED IN 2016.  Bret: OUR LATE COLLEAGUE DR. CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, WE MISS HIS VOICE. I WANT TO BRING IN TWO MORE VOICES LOOKING AT THE ELECTION. A PAIR OF POLLSTERS TO TALK ABOUT THE RESULTS. JOINING US TONIGHT KELLYANNE CONWAY AND MARK PENN. WE HAVE HAD A COUPLE DAYS TO DIGEST EVEN AS THIS IS GOING ON WHAT IS YOUR TAKE AWAY NOW.  TWO TAKEAWAYS T STOPPING RED WAVE. IN THE PREVIOUS FOUR ELECTIONS INDEPENDENCE BROKE FOR THE PARTY OUT OF POWER DIBLE DIGITS. THIS TIME EXIT POLLS THE INDEPENDENTS FAVORED DEMOCRATS 49-47 NARROWLY BUT JUST ENOUGH, I THINK, TO PUSH OVER IN A COUPLE OF THESES RACES. THE OTHER THING IS THE YOUTH VOTE FAVORED 18 TO 29-YEAR-OLD FAVORED DEMOCRATS BY 28 POINTS. LOOK AT A PLACE BY MICHIGAN GRETCHEN WAS NOT PENALIZED FOR LOCKING DOWN GEN Z ACTIVATED BY ACT 3 ON THE BALLOT. REPORTS OF STUDENTS AT MICHIGAN AND MICHIGAN STATE SITTING IN THE COLD WITH PLAN DOTES VOTE ON THE ABORTION REFERENDUM. WE GOT OUR CLOCKS CLEANED IN MICHIGAN STATE LEGISLATIVE RACES LOST. I'M REALLY HAPPY FOR THE REPUBLICANS. I THINK THIS WAS TRANSITIONAL ELECTION TRANSFORMATIVE ONE. WE WILL HAVE MAJORITY CONTROL IN THE HOUSE IN THE SENATE GET BACK TO 50/50 MAYBE. THE DEMOCRATS SPENT A LOT OF MONEY AND HONESTLY DIDN'T HAVE MUCH OF A MESSAGE EXCEPT SCARE PEOPLE. DEMOCRACY IS ON THE BALLOT. BIDEN WASN'T BUT HE WILL BE NEXT TIME. BEST THING FOR REPUBLICANS COMING OUT IN ADDITION TO MAJORITY CONTROL IN THE HOUSE IS THAT JOE BIDEN SAID HE WOULD CHANGE, QUOTE, NOTHING. AND YOU KNOW HE IS RUNNING IN 2024. THAT'S GREAT FOR US.  Bret: , THIS MARK, IS THE BEST A PRESIDENT HAS DONE IN A MIDTERM SINCE GEORGE W. BUSH. YOUR THOUGHTS A COUPLE DAYS OUT NOW AS YOU ARE DIGESTING ALL OF THIS. DID POLLSTERS TAKE OVERCORRECT THINKING THAT THERE WAS AN UNDERCOUNT FOR REPUBLICANS?  LOOK, THE POLLS SHOWED PRETTY MUCH THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE A CLOSELY DIVIDED RACE. AND I THINK THERE WERE PARTICULARLY SOME EXUBERANT POLLS MAYBE IN THE LAST WEEK, PARTICULARLY CENTRAL FALL GARR POLLS BUT WE HAD BEEN RUNNING 5050 IN THE CONGRESSIONAL RACE. A LOT OF PEOPLE VOTED JOE BIDEN WHO DIDN'T DEMOCRATIC AND STICKING WITH THE DEMOCRATS. I THINK THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED HERE. THE ARGUMENT ABOUT THREAT TO DEMOCRACY BECAME A CODE FOR TRUMP. I THINK TRUMP WAS ON THE BALLOT BETH TRUMP AND NEGATIVES. I THINK THE VOTERS DIDN'T LIKE EITHER OF THEM. FEAR TRUMP KEPT PEOPLE WHO VOTED DEMOCRATIC ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. I ALSO THINK THE DEMOCRATS DID REALLY WELL WITH THE MAIL-IN BALLOTS. I THINK THAT UNLESS REPUBLICANS LEARN HOW TO GET THEIR VOTERS TO MAIL IT IN THAT MORE PEOPLE DROP OFF WHETHER OR NOT THEY THINK THEY ARE GOING TO GO TO THE POLLS THAN MAIL IT IN. AND IF THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE MAIL-IN BALLOTS 60-40. MAIL-IN BALLOTS ARE HERE TO STAY. THEY WILL LOSE A LOT OF ELECTIONS WHERE DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE AN EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD TURNOUT PARTICULARLY WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. PLAYED OUT AS WELL, KEEPING MORE WOMEN AND INDEPENDENTS ON THE DEMOCRATIC COLUMN THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT.  Bret: RIGHT. REPUBLICANS HAVE ELECTION DAY. IT SEEMS THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE ELECTION, YOU KNOW, FOUR WEEKS, FIVE WEEKS. LET ME LOOK AT A COUPLE POLLS HERE, THE RCP HAD LAXALT 58.8, CORTEZ MASTO 44.4. NOW WE SEE WHERE THAT IS TODAY. AS THESE COUNTING CONTINUES IN NEVADA. IT'S 49-48. ROUGHLY IN THE REAL VOTE AS THE TOTAL IS COME IN. ARIZONA MASTERS 48.3 AND THE AVERAGE OF POLLS TO 48. AND THAT IN THE REAL VOTE IS 51.7 TO 46.1. ARE YOU SURPRISED AS YOU TICK DOWN, THAT'S THE TREND THAT YOU SEE ABOUT THE POLLS.  WELL, ARIZONA MAY BE A LITTLE. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. YOU HAVE SAW HOW STRONG GOVERNORS WERE ABLE TO PULL ACROSS SOME OF THESE DOWN BALLOT RACES AND THE OPPOSITE WAS ALSO TRUE. MASTRIANO IN PENNSYLVANIA HURT OZ. I DON'T THINK OZ'S CLOSING MESSAGE BRINGING BALANCE TO WASHINGTON IS VERY COMPELLING TO YOUR BASE. THE DEMOCRATS ARE OUT THERE TURNING OUT THE BASE LATE IN THE GAME AND WE ALREADY HAVE BALANCE IN WASHINGTON. THAT'S THE PROBLEM. IT'S 50/50. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WAS A COMPELLING MESSAGE. LOOK, I'M VERY PLEASED AT THE REALIGNMENT GOING ON FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. LOOKS ADORABLE AND PERMANENT IN SOME WAYS. THE FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SHOWED A 15 POINT SWING AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS, HISPANIC VOTERS, THE 13 POINTS BEING AMONG WHITE SUBURBAN FEMALE VOTERS. THESE ARE BIG 6 POINTS UP AMONG JEWISH AMERICAN VOTERS. THIS IS BIG BECAUSE THOSE TEND TO BE DURABLE. AND STATES FLORIDA, OHIO, IOWA ARE NOW SOLIDLY RED. THE DEMOCRATS WON'T WIN THOSE BACK IN 2024.  Bret: MARK, QUICKLY, THE NEXT MAP DOES NOT SET UP WELL FOR DEMOCRATS. THE NEXT ELECTION, BUT YOUR THOUGHTS AS YOU KIND OF COME TO THE END OF THIS ONE?  WELL, I THINK AS WE THINK FORWARD, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, EVEN IF THEY GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE HERE AND WON THE HOUSE OR NOT I THINK THEY ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A WAR THAT IS GOING TO DOMINATE POLITICS BETWEEN TRUMP, BETWEEN DESANTIS, BETWEEN McCARTHY, BETWEEN THE FREEDOM CAUCUS, OH MY GOD. WHEREAS I THINK THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS GOING TO BE MORE UNITED. I THINK -- I DIDN'T THINK JOE BIDEN WOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I THINK HE IS AFTER THIS GOING TO TRY TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. AND WE'RE GOING TO SEE, YOU KNOW, HOW FAR HE MAKES -- HE CERTAINLY GETS A LOT MORE SUPPORT FROM DEMOCRATS AND MUCH MORE UNIFIED, SATISFIED PARTY COMING OUT OF THIS ELECTION THAN PEOPLE EXPECTED.  Bret: I WILL SAY SEAN PATRICK MALONEY AND AOC EXCHANGED SOME BARBS TODAY. MARK, KELLYANNE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PRESIDENT BIDEN SPOKE EARLY TODAY IN EGYPT TO A GLOBAL SUMMIT ON CLIMATE CHANGE. HE IS NOW ON HIS WAY TO CAMBODIA FOR ANOTHER SUMMIT AND A MEETING WITH CHINESE LEADER XI JINPING. BUT HE IS STILL GETTING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MIDTERMS. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT PETER DOOCY IS TRAVEL G WITH THE PRESIDENT IN CAMBODIA, NOW.  IT'S STILL ALIVE. DRAWING AN INSIDE STRAIGHT STILL ALIVE.  THE PRESIDENT WHO INSISTED BEFORE TUESDAY THESE MIDTERMS WOULD NOT BE A REFERENDUM ON HIM SAYS THE RESULTS VALIDATE HIM.  WHAT IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS DO YOU INTEND TO DO DIFFERENTLY?  NOTHING.  THAT INCLUDES HIS ECONOMIC PLAN, WHICH HE OUTLINED ALONG WITH A PLEDGE TO MEET AMBITIOUS EMISSIONS GOALS BY 2030 AT THE 27 CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE IN EGYPT.  PROVING A GOOD CLIMATE POLICY IS GOOD ECONOMIC POLICY.  PRESIDENT BIDEN AND RUSSIAN PRESIDENT PUTIN WERE INVITED TO SOME OF THE SAME MEETINGS IN ASIA THIS WEEK BUT PUTIN WON'T SHOW. INSTEAD, THIS TRIP'S MARQUEE ONE-ON-ONE WILL BE WITH BIDEN AND CHINA'S XI JINPING.  WELL, I HOPE THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY PRESS XI JINPING PUBLICLY. DETERRING THE PLA FROM INVADING TAIWAN IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS IS AMONG OUR NATIONAL SECURITY CHALLENGE.  THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SAYS THE LEADERS WILL EXPRESS EFFORTS TO DEEPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. BUT, LINES OF COMMUNICATION GO BACK DECADES. PRESIDENT BIDEN JUST BOASTED ABOUT THIS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.  I SPENT A LOT OF TIME, MORE TIME WITH XI JINPING THAN ANY OTHER HEAD OF STATE.  NOT CLEAR WHAT ALL THAT TIME GOT HIM OR THE U.S.  SO, IS THERE GOING TO BECOME A TIME WHERE YOU MIGHT CALL HIM OLD FRIEND TO OLD FRIEND.  LET'S GET SOMETHING STRAIGHT. WE KNOW EACH OTHER WELL. WE ARE NOT OLD FRIENDS. IT'S JUST PURE BUSINESS.  THIS IS THE RARE MAJOR INTERNATIONAL SUMMIT. THIS IS THE RARE HOST CITY I SHOULD SAY FOR A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL SUMMIT WHERE CARS ARE OUTNUMBERED BY MOTORBIKES AND CABS CALLED TUKS, SECURITY IMPRINT INCREASE AHEAD THE SUMMIT LOCALS GREW CONCERNED BY ALL THAT SECURITY. THERE'S AN ITEM IN THE LOCAL PAPER AN ENGLISH COPY OF THE LOCAL PAPER WHERE THEY TRY TO CALM SOME OF THOSE NERVES RIGHT HERE ON PAGE 4 GOVERNMENT REJECTS RUMOR U.S. SECURITY FORCES WILL SHOOT ONLOOKERS. THEY REJECT THAT BRET.  Bret: PETER DOOCY, TRAVELING WITH THE PRESIDENT IN CAMBODIA. PETER, THANK YOU. UP NEXT, THE VETERANS DAY STORY YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE FEATURING OUR OWN FOX NEWS EMPLOYEES AND HIS CONNECTION TO A FORMER PRISONER OF WAR.

TRUMP AT 71, RON DESANCTIMONIOUS AT 10%.  I DO NOT CALL PEOPLE NAMES. I REALLY WORK HARD TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.  DO YOU SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE SURROUNDING YOU SAYING GEE I CAN'T WAIT TO BE ARM IN ARM WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP?  WE HAVE A CLEAR MESSAGE AND IT IS TIME TO MOVE ON.  WE HAVE GOT THE BEST POLICIES AND MESSAGES. WE DON'T HAVE UNITY RIGHT NOW.  Bret: WELL, THE 11TH COMMANDMENT WE ARE NOT SURE IT'S STICKING AS OF YET AS WE GET READY FOR WHAT'S AHEAD IN 2024. WE MENTIONED YESTERDAY THE GOVERNOR DESANTIS AND THE 45TH PRESIDENT GOING AFTER HIM. NOW IT HAS AS YOU JUST SAW GOVERNOR YOUNGKIN OF VIRGINIA POST LAST NIGHT FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING YOUNGKIN THAT'S INTERESTING TAKE SOUNDS CHINESE DOESN'T IT. IN VIRGINIA COULDN'T HAVE WON WITHOUT KNEE. I ENDORSED HIM DID A RALLY FOR HIM FELL PHONICALLY GOT MAGA TO VOTE FOR HIM WHERE HE COULDN'T COME CLOSE TO WINNING HE KNOWS THAT BESIDES HAVING A HARD TIME WITH DEMS IN VIRGINIA BUT HE WILL GET IT DONE. LET'S START THERE. BRING IN OUR PANEL. HUGH HEWITT FOX NEWS LEGAL CORRESPONDENT ANCHOR OF \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" SHANNON BREMEN AND FOX NEWS SENIOR ANALYST JUAN WILLIAMS. WELL, SHANNON, WE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO START. JUST DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS GOING TO START BEFORE WE DIDN'T FINISH. [LAUGHTER]  WELL, 2024 WAS ALWAYS IN THE WINGS READY TO BURST FORTH AND IT HAS NOW THOSE THIS TRUMP WORLD SAY TUESDAY THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS COMING. \"ROLLING STONE\" HAD AN INTERESTING ARTICLE SAYING THEY ACCUSED THE PRESIDENT OF GOING OUT AND ACTUALLY ASKING FOR DIRT ON RON DESANTIS AND IS HE STARTING THE RUMOR MILL POLITICS IS A CONTACT SPORT. WE KNEW 2024 WAS GOING TO GET ROUGH. THE PARTY IS GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHICH WAY THEY GO.  Bret: JUAN, EVEN STILL, YOU HAVE THIS RUNOFF DECEMBER 6TH. AND THIS, YOU KNOW, POTENTIALLY EFFECTS SOME OF THAT WHO IS CAMPAIGNING FOR HERSCHEL WALKER, WHAT HAPPENS? DOES THE 45TH PRESIDENT GO IN THERE? YOU KNOW, WHERE DOES IT GO?  WOW, SEE, THAT'S THE VERY CURIOUS THING BECAUSE YOU ARE LOOKING AT DYNAMICS NOW. DYNAMICS TAKING SHAPE. IF YOU ARE HERSCHEL WALKER DO YOU REALLY WANT DONALD TRUMP COMING IN? DOES HE HELP OR DOES HE HURT? LAST TIME HE WAS TELLING PEOPLE DON'T COME OUT TO VOTE. DON'T TRUST IN THE ELECTION PROCESS. NOW HE HAS BECOME EVEN MORE OF A DIVISIVE FIGURE. SECOND THIN IS DOES HE ANNOUNCE BEFORE HE GOES IN? IF HE ANNOUNCES TUESDAY, I'M NOT SURE THEN THAT HE SOME WAYS IS NOT MORE LIKE KRYPTONITE TO SUPERMAN HERSCHEL WALKER. ALL OF A SUDDEN LOOT OF PEOPLE WILL BE SAYING, YOU KNOW WHAT THE PARTY SHOULD BE GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND HE IS PUSHING AGAINST THAT TREND. IT'S VERY -- AND ALSO, LET ME SAY, TUESDAY IS A CURIOUS TIME. KIND OF IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ELECTION. PEOPLE ARE LIKE LET'S HAVE A LITTLE BEFORE WE PICK UP THE PACE.  Bret: HUGH?  I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP IS BEGINNING THE 2016 STRATEGY ALL OVER AGAIN. WHICH IS TAKE ON YOUR MOST SIGNIFICANT RIVAL EARLY THE WAY HE TOOK ON JEB BUSH AND THEN MOVE DOWN THE LINE TO GLENN YOUNGKIN SO HE IS GOING TO REPLAY HIS 2016 PLAYBOOK. DOLLS IT WORK THE SECOND TIME YOU RUN IT IN MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL THE SECOND TIME THE BATTER COMES UP USUALLY HITS BETTER AND FOOTBALL YOU TRY TO GET THE QUARTERBACK THE SECOND TIME AROUND, SO I'M NOT SURE IT WILL WORK. I DON'T LIKE SHOOTING INSIDE OF THE TENT EVER. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK IT HELPS HERSCHEL WALKER. IT DOESN'T HELP HIM AT ALL.  Bret: WHAT ABOUT WHAT THE FALL OUT FROM THIS MIDTERM INSIDE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY? I MEAN, THERE WAS SUCH EXPECTATION. THERE WAS SUCH KIND OF HOPE AND BUILD UP AND THEN TO HAVE PRESIDENT BIDEN BE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL MIDTERM PRESIDENTS SINCE GEORGE W. BUSH.  I WAS AMONG THE MOST EXSUE EXSUEENTER TANT. OUGHT TO BE DISAPPOINTED WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO WIN BIG AND GOING TO WIN LITTLE. HERE'S THE DEAL THOUGH IT'S A WIN AND A WIN IS A WIN AND S. WIN. RIGHT NOW GOT ATTACK ON MITCH McCONNELL BY SOME REPUBLICANS IN THE CAUCUS. THAT MAKES NO SENSE TO ME. WE WILL TALK ABOUT McCARTHY LATER. NEVER SHOOT INSIDE THE TENT, CERTAINLY NOT UNTIL YOU HAVE TO.  Bret: SHANNON, YOU HAVE GOT THIS WEEKEND ON \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" SOME OF THAT DEVELOPING HOUSE DRAMA THAT IT APPEARS THAT LEADER McCARTHY WILL BECOME SPEAKER McCARTHY BUT THERE IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE.  YEAH. THE CONSERVATIVES ARE SPEAKING UP AND SAYING THEY WANT TO EXTRACT SOME PROMISES, SOME CON TETION IS BEFORE THEY GET IN LINE AND VOTE FOR HIM. THEY ARE SAYING PUBLICLY THE VOTES ARE NOT THERE YET. CONGRESSMAN JIM BANKS WITH US. ONE OF THE MORE CONSERVATIVE VOICES IN THE HOUSE. IS HE RUNNING FOR THE WHIP POSITION AGAINST TOM EMMER WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF TURNING THE HOUSE FROM BLUE TO RED. HE SAYS HE DID IT SO HE SHOULD HANG ON. MAYBE NOT IN THE WAY THAT HUGH WAS LOOKING FOR. BUT THOSE INTERPARTY VALUES ARE GOING TO CONTINUE AND LEADERSHIP IS GOING TO BE A FIGHT.  Bret: CHIP ROY FROM TEXAS. WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE TO STAND FOR SOMETHING. WE HAVE FIGHT FOR SOMETHING. DOING SO WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON REAL POLITICAL RISK TO FIGHT FOR THE PEOPLE WE CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS HAVE TAKEN NO SUCH POLITICAL RISK THUS FAR. LEADERSHIP HAS NOT DEMONSTRATED THE WILLINGNESS TO USE ALL THE TOOLS THE AT OUR DISPOSAL TO CHECK RADICAL WHITE HOUSE AND CHECK PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM ITS POLICIES. SEEMS LIKE A BUMPY RIGHT FOR McCARTHY, JUAN. IS HE GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE SOME CONCESSIONS BUT HE DID HAVE JIM JORDAN ON HIS SIDE, SCALISE ON HIS SIDE. KIND OF DID SOME PREP WORK PRIOR TO THIS MOMENT.  RIGHT. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY JIM JORDAN BECAUSE JIM JORDAN HAS BEEN SORT OF THE UNOFFICIAL MAYBE I DON'T KNOW IF HE IS OFFICIALLY THE LEADER OF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS, BUT, HE IS THE SPIRITUAL LEADER. IS HE KIND OF THE FIERY FACE. AND FOR HIM TO SAY RIGHT NOW LET'S STICK WITH McCARTHY, I THINK WAS CRITICAL. SCALISE COULD HAVE STUCK HIM IN THE BACK YOU KNOW AND SAID I'M RUNNING AND HE DIDN'T DO THAT THOSE ARE BOTH GOOD SIGNS. BUFF THE REALITY IS THAT YOU GOT TO MAKE SOME OF THESE CONCESSIONS. YOU HAVE GOT PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE AT THE EXTREMES. I THINK ONE OF THE REASONS DEMOCRATS DID WELL IS I THINK THEY WERE ABLE TO SOME MIGHT SAY CARICATURE BUT CERTAINLY PORTRAY REPUBLICANS AS AN EXTREME ALTERNATIVE. MADE IT LESS OF THE REFERENDUM ON BIDEN. AND MORE OF A CHOICE BETWEEN EXTREMISM AND WHAT LOOKED LIKE NORMALCY.  Bret: HENCE, THE ABORTION AND THREAT TO DEMOCRACY CLOSE THAT THEY USED.  EFFECTIVE AS WELL AS THE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE WHICH I DIDN'T THINK WORKED ANYMORE BUT IT DID. IT WORKED WITH ENOUGH PEOPLE. EVEN THOUGH REPUBLICANS ARE WINNING THE NATIONAL VOTE, IT WORKED IN ENOUGH PLACES TO GET THEM CLOSE.  Bret: LET'S DO WINNERS AND LOSERS.  MY WINNER IS KEVIN McCARTHY. SINCE PAUL RYAN ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMENT IN APRIL OF 2018, LEADER McCARTHY HAS PUT TOGETHER WHAT APPEARS TO BE A MAJORITY. AND HE HAS DONE SO THROUGH HARD WORK BY BEING A BIG TENT REPUBLICAN, BY BEING CONSERVATIVE. WHAT JUAN JUST SAID IS IMPORTANT. HE WILL NEED A GOOD TEAM. SHANNON IS TALKING TO THE GUY I HOPE HE BECOMES THE WHIP BECAUSE OF JIM BANKS I THINK KEVIN McCARTHY IS THE BIG WINNER. THE LOSER OF THE WEEK IS CHINA. BECAUSE KEVIN McCARTHY WINS, HE SETS UP A SELECT COMMITTEE ON CHINA AND THEY WILL BE GOING DEEP INTO WHAT IS OUR NUMBER ONE ADVERSARY IN THE WORLD.  Bret: SHANNON, WINNER AND LOSER?  WINNER I HAVE ALL OF US AS AMERICANS. IT'S VETERANS DAY TODAY. WE ARE SALUTING THEM AND BECAUSE OF THE SACRIFICES THEY HAVE MADE IN THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL, WE HAVE FREEDOM. HAVE YOU GOT MAKE CAMO YOUR CAUSE IF YOU ARE WEARING IT TODAY TO SALUTE OUR VETS. GOD BLESS THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES. MY LOSER IS CHRIS IMA MAGNUS ATP WHETHER HE HANGS ON OR NOT A PUSH TO PUSH HIM OUT THE DOOR. WHETHER HE HANGS ON OR NOT, IT HAS BEEN A ROUGH HISTORICALLY BAD YEAR AT THE BORDER FOR HIM.  Bret: WINNER AND LOSER, JUAN?  I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR FROM THE TONE OF OUR CONVERSATION THE WINNER IS PRESIDENT BIDEN. THE DEMOCRATS YOU KNOW, THEY BALKED HISTORY AS YOU POINTED OUT EARLIER IN THE SHOW, BRET, BEST MIDTERM PERFORMANCE BY INCUMBENT PARTY IN POWER IN 20 YEARS. AND NOBODY, I THINK, UNDERSTOOD THE DYNAMICS AT PLAY BUT PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS CONSISTENT IN HIS MESSAGING AND IT WAS EFFECTIVE. HE AVOIDED THE RED WAVE. THE LOSER OF THE WEEK I THINK IS DONALD TRUMP. AND YOU KNOW, IT'S ODD FOR KNEE SAY THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE SAY WELL, YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT. NO, BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU, POLITICALLY, HE IS MORE DAMAGED NOW. HIS RIVALS, IT SEEMS TO ME, RON DESANTIS IN FLORIDA, YOUNGKIN, I THINK THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING VERY WELL RIGHT NOW, OBVIOUSLY DESANTIS HAD A GREAT WEEK. GREAT PERFORMANCE. AND I THINK THAT THE POLLS SHOW RIGHT NOW BIDEN IS MORE POPULAR THAN TRUMP. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE WHERE IS HE GOING EXCEPT SELF-SERVING ATTACKS.  Bret: YEAH. I WAS GOING TO TAKE A TRIP DOWN TO CANDIDATE CASINO BUT I NOTICED YOU ARE ALL ABOUT 50/50 ON THE SENATE CONTROL. SO, THE CASINO IS CLOSED. [LAUGHTER]  THANK GOODNESS.  I LOST EVERYTHING LAST WEEK.  LOCK IT UP.  Bret: ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. \u266a \u266a  Bret: IT IS FRIDAY. IT'S FRIDAY. TIME FOR \"NOTABLE QUOTABLES.\"  IT IS 7:00 P.M. IN THE EAST AND POLLS HAVE NOW CLOSED.  YOU DID IT, JOE. [LAUGHTER]  WHAT'S YOUR NEW REALITY GOING TO BE LIKE IN WASHINGTON?  MORE DIFFICULT.  FLORIDA IS WHERE WOKE GOES TO DIE.  AND YOUR WORDS FREAKIN' NIGHTMARE.  WE'RE FEELING GOOD ABOUT WHAT WE ARE SEEING.  THERE WAS NO RED WAVE, IT WAS A RIPPLE.  I THINK IT WAS NOT A GOOD NIGHT FOR DONALD TRUMP.  I'M GOING TO BE MAKING A VERY BIG ANNOUNCEMENT ON TUESDAY NOVEMBER 15TH.  WE ARE EXACTLY WHERE WE WANT TO BE IN THIS RACE.  THE VOTES ARE STILL BEING COUNTED. WE KNOW THIS WILL TAKE TIME.  YOU MARK MY WORD, THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA ARE GOING TO GET THIS RIGHT.  I THINK THE LORD PREPARED ME FOR A MOMENT LIKE THIS RIGHT HERE.  NICOLE EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING ALL OF THE SURGE FROM THE SEA AND THE CHURNING WAVES JUST ATE AWAY THE SANDY FOUNDATIONS.  PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY AND THE UKRAINIANS HAVE TO BE OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF NEGOTIATIONS BUT ON THEIR TERMS. NOT ON RUSSIA'S TERMS.  BY LENDING YOUR TALENTS TO THE UNITED STATES MILITARY, YOU MADE US STRONGER AND SMARTER. YOU REMINDED US THAT THIS DEMOCRACY IS WORTH DEFENDING.

WE REJOIN THE PARIS AGREEMENT, I APOLOGIZE WE EVER PULLED OUT OF THE AGREEMENT, AND SEND THE LAW OF THE PROPOSAL FOR THE BIGGEST MOST IMPORTANT CLIMATE BILL IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT. WE ARE PROVING A GOOD CLIMATE POLICY IS GOOD ECONOMIC POLICY. RACING FORWARD TO DO OUR PART TO REVERT THE CLIMATE HELL THAT THE GENERAL WARNED ABOUT SO PASSIONATELY EARLIER THIS WEEK.  Dana: HE DID NOT COMPLAIN ON THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT, BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT FUELED INFLATION.  Harold: BEFORE I ANSWER THAT QUESTION, THE PULLING INDUSTRY NEEDS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AS WELL, AND I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR, I WILL NEVER HIRE POSTER, LET EVERYBODY ELSE RUN THEM AND TRY TO REACT, BUT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT TELL US WHAT THE ISSUES WERE AND MOST IMPORTANT TO VOTERS AND MUST BE SOME MISALIGNMENT. THERE HAS TO BE SOME MISALIGNMENT, TO HIS POINT, BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION, I'M NOT SURPRISED AT ALL THAT HE CHOSE TO GO TO THE CONFERENCE IN EGYPT AND MAKE THE STATEMENTS HE HAS MADE. I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TALKED AS I HAVE FOR A LONG TIME THAT WE NEED IN ALL OF THE ABOVE INTERVIEW STRATEGY AND NEED TO TALK ABOUT UKRAINE AND HOW WE HELP LEAD THE EUROPEANS OFF OF THAT ENERGY SOURCE, BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED BY WHAT HE DID AND I THINK FOR THOSE THAT ARE OPPOSED TO WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT WOULD BEHOOVE THEM AND HELP THE COUNTRY, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN ELECT TO OFFER A SET OF PROPOSALS AND NOT COUNTER WHAT HE IS SAYING, BUT SAY I CAN IMAGINE ANYBODY ONCE THE ENVIRONMENT TO BE DIRTY, EVERYBODY WANTS -- WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO HOW YOU DO IT, SO AUTHOR A DIFFERENT APPROACH IF YOU DON'T LIKE HIS APPROACH, BUT RIGHT NOW HE IS THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN, BECAUSE IT REVEALS JUST AS HE IS WRONG, IT'S NOT AN IMPORTANT ISSUE, I DON'T EVER WANT TO HEAR A PERSON QUOTE OH POLE AGAIN ABOUT WHAT IS IMPORTANT.  Dana: WE WILL KEEP THAT IN MIND BECAUSE I KNOW YOU WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT. I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU SOMETHING ABOUT SOME NUMBERS, BUT THEY ARE NOT A POLE. SO THEY HAVE 40,000 REGISTERED PARTICIPANTS, THAT INCLUDES 22,000 DELEGATES, 14,000 OBSERVERS AND 4,000 PEOPLE FROM THE MEDIA TO GET TOGETHER EVERY YEAR TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THEY ALL AGREE ON.  Greg: EXACTLY, NO ONE OPPOSES THE ENVIRONMENT, WHAT WE OPPOSE IS THIS. THIS IS PHONY. THESE PEOPLE LOVE THESE TRIPS. IT'S FREE MEALS, ITS FREE BEDS TO BREAKFAST AND HOOKERS AND GOD KNOWS WHAT ELSE, JUDGE, I KNOW, IT'S DISGUSTING. IT DISCUSSED ME. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF HE SHOWS AT A FRACTION OF CONCERN ABOUT THE STUFF WE CARE ABOUT RATHER THAN A FERRY IN SCOTLAND, BUT HE GOES WHERE THE VIRTUE SIGNAL GETS THE MOST PAYOFF, THAT'S WITH ENVIRONMENT, GENDER, YOU CAN'T BE THE BAD GUY IF YOU GO THERE. SO IT'S VERY EASY. YOU CAN SMILE BECAUSE YOU JUST PLEDGE AMERICAN TAXPAYER MONEY, THIS IS A GREAT ISSUE FOR SOMEBODY LIKE JOE BIDEN BECAUSE IT IS A NO-BRAINER.  Dana: I SEE WHAT YOU DID.  Greg: IN YOUR FACE, HAROLD. IT  Dana: THEY ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WILL BE A CLIMATE GENDER EQUITY FUND. THE WORLD NEEDS THAT.  Will: WE HAVE BEEN SEEKING THAT JUSTICE. YOU GUYS HAVE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION THAT I WANT TO GRAB ONTO, SO FIRST OF ALL, I LIKE HOW YOU SAID THIS, EVERYBODY WANTS A CLEAN ENVIRONMENT, AND YOU AGREED WITH THAT CONCEPT AS DO I.  Greg: I WAS LYING.  Will: EVERYBODY AGREES THAT THERE IS SOME INTEREST IN CONSERVATION, BUT THAT IS NOT THE SAME THING AS A GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE INITIATIVE WHICH IS A CATCH-ALL BUCKETS THAT HAS BEEN THE USE I THINK VERY SUCCESSFULLY TO CONTROL ALL MANNER OF OUR LIVES. AND THAT'S WHERE THE FIGHT, HAROLD, BEGINS, BUT I'M VERY FASCINATED BY YOU SAYING YOU DISTRUST POLLING IN THE WAKE OF THESE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. I'M JUST ASKING OUT OF GENUINE CURIOSITY, ARE YOU SAYING THEREFORE BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE MIDTERM HASBROUCK COME YOU DON'T BELIEVE FOR EXAMPLE INFLATION, AND CRIME WERE ACTUALLY AS IMPORTANT TO VOTERS AS AND THAT'S WHY WE GOT THE RESULTS WE GOT?  I THINK THAT PEOPLE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS, WOULD NOT HAVE PICKED REPUBLICANS, THE FOUR SEATS HERE IN NEW YORK BUT FOR CRIME, BUT VOTERS IN MICHIGAN WHERE CRIME IS HAPPENING DECIDED TO ELECT THE HOUSE IN THE SENATE TO DEMOCRATS, THEY HAD AN ABORTION BUILT LEGISLATION ON THE BALLOT AS WELL, ALL I'M SAYING, TAKE THE POLL FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH, THAT WHEN PEOPLE RELY ON THEM SOLELY I THINK THAT'S WRONG. IN ADVANCE THE ANSWER AGAINST. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, I GET THAT. BUT REPUBLICANS I DON'T BELIEVE DID THAT ON THE ISSUES, WHICH IS WHY AT THE END OF THE DAY VOTERS DO NOT REWARD THEM WITH THE MARGINS THAT THEY WANTED.  Dana: GRIDLOCK IN WASHINGTON IS COMING, BUT THAT WILL MEAN THAT THERE IS NOT A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE TO REVERSE THE BIDEN POLICY IS IN TODAY THEY ANNOUNCED ANOTHER REGULATION THAT THEY WANT TO PUT ON FOR THE METHANE. AND SO THAT'S NOT GOING TO STOP AND THOSE POLICIES WILL CONTINUE.  Judge Jeanine: I THINK THAT JOE BIDEN GOES WHERE EVER HE THINKS HE WILL BE WELL RECEIVED. AND SO WITHIN 48 HOURS OF AN ELECTION COME OVER 75% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THINK THE COUNTRY IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, WHERE THE HOUSE IS NOT SETTLED YET, THE SENATE IS NOT SETTLED YET, THE GUY RUNS TO EGYPT. I GET IT. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE IN EGYPT, IT IS FABULOUS OVER THERE, I LOVE EGYPT, OKAY, BUT THE ISSUE OF GOING OVER THERE AND SAYING WE ARE GOING TO GIVE ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION TO DEVELOPING NATIONS, ANOTHER HUNDRED 50 MILLION FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR OTHER AFRICAN NATIONS, $11 BILLION TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE IN NATIONS THAT ADMIT FEWER GREENHOUSE GASES WHEN HE GAVE $700 BILLION OF HIS INFLATION REDUCTION ACT THAT DOES NOT REDUCE INFLATION IS TO ME AND OUTRAGE IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE ARE SUFFERING DOUBLE-DIGIT INFLATION IN THE ECONOMY IS TERRIBLE. OKAY, AND TO LET ME JUST SAY ONE THING. IF HE THINKS HE IS GOING TO GET ANY OF THIS MONEY PASSED THROUGH THE HOUSE HE IS OUT OF HIS MIND. BECAUSE THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO CONTROL THE HOUSE. AND THERE IS SOMETHING THAT JESSE SAID SEVERAL MONTHS AGO THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC, AND I HAVE TO QUOTE HIM AGAIN, THAT CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE HIT RECORD HIGHS DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN NOBODY WAS DRIVING, WHEN THERE WERE NO FACTORIES OPEN, WHEN THERE WAS A PANDEMIC DIP, OMISSIONS DROPPED THAT YEAR, WHICH MAKES NO SENSE, THERE WERE NO POWER PLANTS, THERE WAS NOTHING GOING ON PAIRED SO WHAT ARE WE DOING BY POURING MONEY THAT PEOPLE NEED TO SURVIVE TO LIVE TO OTHER COUNTRIES SO THAT THEY CAN BE OKAY? YOU KNOW WHAT, TAKE CARE OF AMERICANS.  Dana: I READ A STATISTIC IN THE DAILY TELEGRAPH THAT CHINA WILL ADMIT MORE POLLUTION THAN THE ENTIRE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IN ENGLAND.  Greg: YOU KNOW WHAT THAT POLLUTION IS? TIKTOK.  Dana: TIKTOK. PARENTS MAKING THEIR VOICES HEARD AT THE BALLOT BOXES, BUT ONE DEMOCRAT THINKS SUPPORTING PARENTS RIGHTS IN EDUCATION IS STUPID. \u266a \u266a 20221111222400.404|20221111222808.752",

TODAY IS VETERANS DAY AND WE HONOR ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED OUR GREAT NATION IN UNIFORM AND WE THANK THEM FOR THEIR SERVICE AND SACRIFICES. WE ARE SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE ROB ON THE COUCH THEY'VE DECORATED WAR VETERAN WHO SERVED TWO TOURS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. ROB, THEY GET FOR YOUR SERVICE AND FOR JOINING US TODAY.  Rob: THANK YOU, ALWAYS.  Emily: TURNING TO OUR TOP STORY, THE BALANCE OF POWER IN WASHINGTON, THE SENATE DOWN TO THE WIRE WITH RECEIPTS AND PLAY IN GEORGIA AT A RUNOFF WITH THE VOTE COUNTING IN THE ARIZONA END ABOUT A. WE MAY NOT KNOW THOSE RESULTS OUT WEST UNTIL THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. OVER IN THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE EDGING CLOSE TO THAT MAGIC NUMBER OF 218 FOR A MAJORITY. THEY ARE CONFIDENT THEY WILL GET THERE, BUT IT IS STILL NOT A DONE DEAL. PRESIDENT BIDEN BELIEVES DEMOCRATS STILL HAVE A PATH TO KEEPING THE IN THEIR CORNER.  President Biden: YOU KNOW, IT IS STILL ALIVE. IT IS STILL ALIVE. LIKE DRAWING AN INSIDE STRAIGHT, STILL ALIVE.  Emily: MEANWHILE ON WEDNESDAY HE CLAIMED HE IS READY TO WORK WITH THE G.O.P.  President Biden: REGARDLESS THERE STILL SOME COUNTING GOING ON. I AM PREPARED TO WORK IN MY REPWITH MYREPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES. THEY MADE CLEAR I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE CLEAR TO BE WORK WITH ME AS WELL.  Emily: DOES HE REALLY WANT TO BURY THE HATCHET? AFTER ALL HE SAID THIS AT THE SAME NEWS CONFERENCE.  President Biden: I WILL NOT SUPPORT ANY REPUBLICAN AND DON'T PROPOSAL IT WILL MAKE INFLATION WORSE. AND TO TAKE ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS THEY ARE NOT COVER MY CIVIL ISSUES TO ME AND I WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL I SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD BY SENATOR JOHNSON AND FROM DOWN IN FLORIDA. TO CUT OR MAKE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN SOCIAL SECURITY/MEDICARE. THAT IS NOT ON THE TABLE. I WILL NOT DO THAT. I WILL VETO ANY ATTEMPT AT PASSING A NATIONAL BAN ON ABORTION, I WILL BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS AND CRY LIKE THE DEVIL.  Emily: I HAVE A LOT OF WHIPLASH THERE FROM THAT PRESIDENT GOING BACK AND FORTH.  Rob: ITS BACK AND FORTH AND REALLY FUNNY BECAUSE YOU WATCH THAT CLIP OF HIM AND HE IS VERY STATESMANLIKE, I WILL WORK WITH REPUBLICANS, WE WILL ALL WORK TOGETHER BUT YOU CAN'T TRUST THAT TO THE SPEECHES HE HAS GIVEN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS WITH THE SUPER-DUPER MEGA MARIO BROTHER REPUBLICANS, THE MAGA REPUBLICANS AND HOW THEY WILL DESTROY AMERICA. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY WILL PUT THE EVIL JOE BIDEN, THE ONE WHO DEMONIZES MAGA REPUBLICANS THAT'S A REAL JOE BIDEN AND THAT'S WHAT A G.O.P. CONTROLLED CONGRESS WILL BE DEALING WITH.  Emily: WHAT YOU THINK THE VOTERS THINK AS THE VOTERS WENT TO THE POLLS HAVE WHIPLASH AS WELL IS WHAT ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS BECAUSE HE WASN'T COMMITTED TO UNIFICATION OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.  Carley: AT THE GREAT QUESTION AND I UNDERSTAND WHY THE PRESIDENT IS FEELING COMPETENT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE RESULTS PANNED OUT BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE ONE OF THE REPORTERS ASKED HIM 75% OF THE COUNTRY FEEL WE ARE GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'RE GOING TO CHANGE AND HE SAID HE IS NOT CHANGING ANYTHING AND PEOPLE WILL SOON REALIZE ALL THE GOOD HE HAS DONE WHICH HASN'T KICKED IN YET. THAT'S LIKE A GUY SAYING HE WILL WILL, SHE WILL LET ME ONE DAY.  SHE JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT YET.  Carley: AND THE CNBC STUDY, 73% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO GET STUDENT LOAN RELIEF PLAN TO USE THE MONEY ON TRAVEL AND DINING OUT.  Emily: WHAT A SHOCKER.  Carley: THAT IS PEOPLE WHO DECIDED TO SKIP DEGREE OR PAYING OFF THEIR LOANS PAYING FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S DINNERS AND VACATIONS AND BY THE WAY, THAT MONEY WILL INCREASE INFLATION. OVER ALL WHEN IT COMES TO MIDTERM ELECTION RESULTS I WAS TALKING TO ONE POLLSTER, REPUBLICAN POLLSTER AND SHE SAID REPUBLICANS ARE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE PLACE BECAUSE IF REPUBLICANS DID GET A LOT OF SEATS AND WE HAD A LARGE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE, IT WOULD BE GRIDLOCK AND REPUBLICANS COULD GET PLAYED FOR THAT. NOW WE ARE NOT. A CYNICAL POSITIVE SPIN ON THINGS BUT THAT'S ONE PERSPECTIVE I WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO THE TABLE TODAY.  Emily: I LOVE THAT AND I WOULD LIKE TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS AS WELL, LAURA, WHICH IS AN INTERESTING SORT OF NOTION ON VOTER TURNOUT AND WHERE DEMOCRATS SHOULD FOCUS OUR EFFORTS HERE HE ARGUES ESSENTIALLY THAT THEY SHOULD FOCUS ON STATES LIKE MISSISSIPPI, NOT FLORIDA, TAKE A WATCH.  IT IS NOT BAD MISSISSIPPI. I THINK THERE'S NOT AS MANY ELECTORAL VOTES BUT I THINK DEMOCRATS MIGHT BE BETTER OFF LOOKING AT MISSISSIPPI THEN FLORIDA. I DON'T KNOW THAT, I'M JUST RIFFING OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. BUT IT HAS BEEN VERY FRUST FRUSTRATING.  Emily: I WOULD SAY THAT SINCE LOUISIANA'S 33.% BLACKWATER POPULATION HE SAID IT MIGHT BODE WELL FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. OR PUTTING THAT INTO OLD BOX BUT IT'S AN INTERESTING NOTION BECAUSE LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI HAVE 13 ELECTORAL VOTES COMPARED TO FLORIDA'S 29 BUT HAS THIS PUT DEMOCRATS BACK ON HIS LITTLE BIT AS THEY ATTEMPT TO GO DOWN THE RAMP THE NEXT TWO YEARS?  Lara: NOW THAT WE ARE, GOSH WE ARE NOT OFFICIALLY DONE WITH MIDTERMS, STILL WAITING IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT, AMERICA, FOR ALL OF THESE VOTE COUNTS TO COME OUT. NOW THAT WE ARE COMING FROM THE MIDTERMS EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT 2024 OF COURSE AND A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THAT MAGIC NUMBER IS 270 ELECTORAL VOTES. FLORIDA HAS 29 AS HE MENTIONED, I DON'T THINK HE IS WRONG. I THINK FLORIDA IS A SOLID RED STATE. I LIVE IN FLORIDA AND I DID WHAT SO MANY PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN NEW YORK, DID. WE MOVED TO FLORIDA. IF YOU LOOK SIMPLY AT THE MARGIN BY WHICH LEE ZELDIN LOST THE GOVERNOR'S RACE HERE IN THE MARGIN THAT RON DeSANTIS WON OVER WHAT HE HAD IN 2018, YOU SEE IT WAS LESS THEN 300,000 VOTES BY WHICH LEE ZELDIN LOST HERE. AND IT WAS AROUND 500,000 MORE VOTES FOR RON DeSANTIS IN 2022 VERSUS 2018. THOSE PEOPLE MOVE FROM NEW YORK TO FLORIDA. ARGUABLY LEE ZELDIN COULD BE THE GOVERNOR RIGHT NOW OF NEW YORK IF THOSE PEOPLE HAD STAYED HERE BUT I THINK IT TELLS YOU WHAT PEOPLE WANTED WHEN THEY MOVED TO FLORIDA. THEY WANTED THE POLICIES OF REPUBLICANS, THAT IS A STATE THAT THEY ARE NOT SEEING IS A SWING STATE AS WE HEAD TOWARD THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2024. THEY MAY SAY WHY DO WE EVEN WASTE OUR TIME LOOKING AT FLORIDA AND BOTHERING DOWN HERE WHENEVER MAYBE THEY ARE GOING TO SEE IF THEY CAN PICK UP A FEW SEATS OR NUMBERS. FROM MISSISSIPPI OR LOUISIANA OR SOMEWHERE ELSE.  Emily: CARA, YOUR THOUGHTS?  Kara: I THINK IT'S INTERESTING THAT REPUBLICANS ARE ON TRACK TO WIN THE POPULAR VOTE, ONE WAS A LESSON WE HEARD THAT? WE TALK ABOUT THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE AND WHAT NOT. THAT IS A REPUDIATION OF WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD, RIGHT? REPUBLICANS WORRY WANT RON DeSANTIS, J.D. VANCE, THESE ARE BOLD POLICY AFFIRMATIVE AGENDAS. REPUBLICANS NEED TO BE FOR SOMETHING. THAT'S WHERE WE WERE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL. WE CAN'T BE AGAINST WITH THE DEMOCRATS ARE DOING, THAT IS HUGE, WE NEED OVERSIGHT WHEN WE FINALLY TAKE THE HOUSE BUT AT THE SAME TIME REPUBLICANS WE CAN GOVERN AND I THINK AMERICA UNDERSTANDS GOOD GOVERNANCE IS REPUBLICAN AND CONSERVATIVE GOVERNANCE APPEARED I'M HAPPY ABOUT THAT.  Emily: ME TOO, MY DEAR. WORLD LEADERS ARE IN EGYPT FOR CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND CRITICS ARE CALLING THEM HYPOCRITES BECAUSE OF HOW THEY GOT THERE, THAT IS NEXT. \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a no upfront costs 20221111170845.573|20221111171300.394",

        "trs": " Laura: ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THING ABOUT THE DOBBS DECISION IS ABOUT TO CHALLENGE AMERICAN WOMEN WHEN THE JUSTICE SAID THEY HAVE IT IN THEIR POWER TO SAY LET'S SEE WHAT THEY'LL DO? GUESS WHAT? YA'LL SHOWED UP AND BEAT THE HELL OUT OF THEM.  Laura: HOW LOVELY. IF YOU WONDERED WHY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WORKS SO HARD TO PUSH ABORTION AND BRING ABOUT THE DETERIORATION OF THE NUCLEAR FAMILY, LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THESE RESULTS. MARRIED MEN BROKE FOR REPUBLICANS BY 20 POINTS. MARRIED WOMEN BROKE FOR REPUBLICANS BY 14 POINTS. WHILE UNMARRIED MEN BROKE FOR REPUBLICANS, IT WAS BY SEVEN POINTS. BUT UNMARRIED WOMEN, THEY WENT DEMOCRAT BY 37 POINTS. JOINING ME NOW, KIRA DAVIS, HOST OF THE JUST LISTEN TO YOUR IS SELF PODCAST. BY 2010 FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR COUNTRY'S HISTORY, MOST HOUSEHOLDS DIDN'T INCLUDES A MARRIED COUPLE AND MARRIAGE CONTINUES TO DECLINE SINCE THEN. IS THIS THE DEMOCRAT'S NEW SOCCER MOMS? WHAT IS THIS?  IT'S ALWAYS BEEN THIS WAY. HASN'T IT, RIGHT? WE'VE SEEN THIS IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THIS WAS THE DEMOCRAT'S STRATEGY IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT HAS DESTROYED THE BLACK COMMUNITY. MANY PEOPLE WARNING ABOUT THE ISSUES SPREADING OUT TO GENERAL AMERICA AND THEY HAVE. WE'VE SEEN THE WHAT THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NUCLEAR FAMILY DOES IN BLACK AMERICA. AND WE ALSO -- IT'SES WILL NOT COINCIDENTAL THAT BLACK AMERICA DOES VOTE HELY TO DEMOCRATS. YOU NEED A STRONG NUCLEAR FAMILY TO HAVE STRONG PRINCIPLES TO HAVE STRONG CHARACTER. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FAMILY PROVIDING FOR YOU. YOU'LL SEEK OUT SOMEONE TO PROVIDE FOR YOU. IN THE CASE OF A LOT OF SINGLE WOMEN, THAT'S THE GOVERNMENT.  Laura: AND FORMER KAMALA HARRIS ADVISER SIMONE SANDERS HAD SOMETHING TO SAY TODAY ABOUT THE ABORTION ISSUE.  WE HEARD FOR WEEKS AT POST KANSAS HOW DEMOCRATS OVERCALCULATED ON ROE, ABORTION IS NOT A KITCHEN TABLE ISSUE. IF YOU ARE A WOMAN, A PERSON WITH A ADULTSER A FAMILY A MAN IN THIS COUNTRY, IT IS A KITCHEN TABLE ISSUE FOR YOU. ABORTION IS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE AND WE'RE SEEING THAT IN THE VOTES.  Laura: WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS PUSH TO MAKE ABORTION JUST AN ECONOMIC ISSUE LIKE A CHILD IS JUST A NUMBER?  IT'S MORBID. IT IS. IT'S VERY DISTURBING. TO HEAR A BLACK WOMAN SAYING SHE'S ADVOCATING FOR FEWER BLACK WOMEN IN THE WORLD, YEAH, I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT. SINCE THE DAWN OF HUMANITY, FAMILIES HAVE BEEN THE KEY TO ECONOMIC SUCCESS. AT ONE TIME, YOU NEEDED A BIG FAMILY TO HELP WORK AND SUPPORT THE FAMILY. NOW FAMILIES ARE THE KEYS TO MAKING US MATURE, MAKING US IN TO THE TYPE OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO CARE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES, CARE FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. SO THE FAMILY ISN'T JUST ABOUT A MOM, A DAD, KIDS AND PEOPLE HOLDING HANDS AND MAYBE TRYING TO DO THEIR BEST IMITATION OF LEAVE IT TO BEAVER. THE FAMILY IS THE BASIS OF A STABLE AND THRIVING SOCIETY. SO IT'S NO WONDER THAT AMERICA IS IN A LOT OF CHAOS RIGHT NOW. THE NUCLEAR FAMILY IS IN A TON OF CHAOS.  Laura: NO WONDER IT'S A THREAD TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THANK YOU. THERE'S EVIDENCE THAT THE FBI TONIGHT KNEW ABOUT JANUARY 6 MONTHS BEFORE IT HAPPENED AND DID NOTHING. WHILE EVERYONE WAS FOCUSED ON THE MID-TERMS TUESDAY. THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" CONVENIENTLY DROPPED THIS PIECE SAYING AN INFORMANT LIKELY TO TESTIFY AS DEFENSE WITNESS IN OATH KEEPER'S SADITION TRIAL. JOINING ME NOW, JULIE KELLY, SENIOR WRITER FOR AMERICAN GREATNESS AND AUTHOR OF JANUARY 6, HOW DEMOCRATS USE THE CAPITOL PROTEST TO LAUNCH A WAR OF TERROR AGAINST THE POLITICAL RIGHT. THIS IS A STUNNING DETAIL LENDING CREDENCE TO A LOT OF THE WORK IN YOUR BOOK.  IT CERTAINLY IS QUITE A BOMB SHELL. THE IDEA THAT THE NUMBER 2 WHO THEY CALLED THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE OATH KEEPERS, THIS ALLE ALLEGED MALITIA GROUP, THE IDEA THAT HE WAS WORKING WITH THE FBI AS AN INFORMANT FOR MONTHS BEFORE JANUARY 6 IS PRETTY EXPL EXPLOSIVE. THIS MIRRORS THE GRETCHEN WHITMIRE FED NAPPING HOAX WHERE THE TOP FBI INFORMANT PAID ROUGHLY $60,000 FOR HIS WORK ALSO WAS THE NUMBER 2, THE COMMANDING OFFICER OF AN ALLEGED MALITIA GROUP INVOLVED IN THAT CASE. HE USED HIS POSITION TO LURE PEOPLE IN TO THIS ENTRAPMENT SCHEME. SO ONCE AGAIN, WE HAVE A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE WHITMIRE FED NAPPING HOAX, WHICH INVOLVED DOZENS OF FBI SUPERVISING AGENTS AND UNDERCOVER AGENTS. ANOTHER COMPARISON BETWEEN THAT AND THE EVENTS OF JANUARY 6.  Laura: JULIE, WE'LL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THIS. I KNOW THERE'S A PRETRIAL DETENTION FINALLY LIFTED FOR 20 MONTHS WHEN A FORM MARINE WAS IN PRETRIAL DETENTION AFTER JANUARY 6. THAT ALSO HAPPENED THIS WEEK. THANK YOU. JOE BIDEN IS CONFIDENT TUESDAY PUT HIM IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT FOR 2024. SOME OF HIS MEDIA CHEERLEADERS NOT SO CERTAIN.

ACCORDING TO THE NEW REPORT, THE SECOND DUDE WANTS TO BE THE FIRST DUDE. DOUG EMHOFF, SECOND GENTLEMAN, HAS TOLD THE PARTY MUST RALLY AROUND HARRIS SHOULD BIDEN NOT RUN. THERE ARE OTHER IDEAS ON WHO SHOULD SUCCEED JOE BIDEN.  THIS IS A GUY YOU KNOW WHO HE IS, YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS GETTING AND THAT ULTIMATELY MATTERS IN POLITICS.  FETTERMAN AT SOME POINT AS A NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT, I KNOW THERE ARE SOME VARIABLES, OBVIOUSLY, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT -- WHAT HE DID IN THE SUPER RED, DEEP RED PARTS OF PENNSYLVANIA AND THE WAY HE RAN AHEAD OF BIDEN, AS YOU WERE SAYING, REDHEAD OF TRUMP, IT MAKES YOU WONDER ABOUT HIS FUTURE.  Jesse: SOMETIMES, IN CABLE, DATA, YOU JUST SAY THINGS.  Dana: I WAS GOING TO SAY -- [LAUGHTER] GET A LITTLE REACTION. TO BE ON ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS --  Dana: AND NO CONSEQUENCES.  Greg: THERE SHOULD BE. YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY STUPID STUFF LIKE THAT. I SAY AT LEAST SIX STUPID THINGS A DAY --  Jesse: THIS SEGMENT.  Dana: JUST PUT IT OUT THERE.  Jesse: PROVOCATIVE, GREG.  Dana: FOR THE STORIES ARE ON DOUG EMHOFF TRYING TO RALLY THE TROOPS BEHIND KAMALA HARRIS, THEY REPORTEDLY MET WITH ROLLING EYES IN THE WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE, FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD NEVER WANT MY HUSBAND TO DO THAT FOR ME. IF YOU ARE NOT -- IF PEOPLE ARE NOT GROWLING AT AROUND YOU, YOU CANNOT HAVE YOUR HUSBAND -- WE HAVE NEVER HAD A SECOND GENTLEMAN BEFORE, BUT I ASSUME IF THE PEOPLE IN THE WEST WING AREN'T TAKING HER SERIOUSLY, HOW SERIOUSLY ARE THEY TAKING HIM?  Jesse: YOU KNOW COUPLES WHERE THE HUSBAND REALLY ENCOURAGES THE WIFE'S CAREER AND IT IS NOT REALLY TAKE OFF.  Greg: SECOND GENTLEMAN SOUNDS LIKE THE TITLE OF, LIKE, A CINEMAX -- REMEMBER CINEMAX, THOSE LATE-NIGHT SIX? MAY BE A ROMANCE COVER WITH FAR BEYOND THE COVER.  Dana: STACEY ABRAMS MIGHT WANT TO WORK ON IT.  Greg: I AM MORE INTERESTED IN HOW FETTERMAN HAS RUINED THE LOOK OF THE HOODIE FOR ME. I USED TO LIKE TO WEAR A HOODIE BUT WHEN YOU START WEARING IT IN INAPPROPRIATE PLACES, IT KIND OF STAINED ITS BEAUTY SO THAT IS WHEN I'M NOT VOTING FOR HIM FOR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU.  Jesse: DO YOU WANT TO TAKE ON, JUDGE, FETTERMAN FOR PRESIDENT LINE, OR DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE DUDE, THE SECOND DUDE?  Jeanine: I WANT TO TALK ABOUT KAMALA. HOW COULD HE PUSH HER? SHE HAS THE LOWEST APPROVAL RATINGS, DID NOT EVEN MAKE IT TO THE IOWA CAUCUSES, THE WOMAN HAS BEEN GIGGLING LIKE SHE HAS BEEN LAUGHING THE WHOLE TWO YEARS SO FAR. SHE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING SMART. AND SHE JUST GIGGLES. EVERY PICTURE, I MEAN, IT IS SO DISAPPOINTING FOR WOMEN. EMHOFF, I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS, I DON'T CARE WHO HE IS ABOUT I DON'T THINK SHE IS GOING ANYWHERE. LET'S TALK ABOUT FETTERMAN, THE GUY CANNOT GET OUT OF HIS OWN WAY BUT IT WORKS FOR A DEMOCRAT. IF YOU'RE NOT A QUALITY CANDIDATE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE YOU, YOU DO NOT GET ELECTED, BUT IF YOU ARE AN IDIOT WHO HIDES EITHER IN A TROJAN HORSE LIKE JOE BIDEN OR FETTERMAN OR, WHAT'S HER NAME, KATIE HOBBS, YOU GET ELECTED.  Jesse: THE BEST FETTERMAN LINE, WHILE THE RHYTHM OF TO SUPPORT FRACKING? HE IS LIKE, YES. YOU USED TO NOT SUPPORT FRACKING. HE WAS LIKE, I SUPPORT FRACKING. GREAT CANDIDATE, RIGHT.  Jessica: YEAH COME IN A LOT OF WAYS, HE WAS. IF YOU WATCH THE PRIMARY PLAY OUT, I WAS SUPPORTIVE OF CONOR LAMB, I THOUGHT HE WAS THE BETTER CHOICE FOR IT, BUT --  Jesse: WHAT DO YOU KNOW? L.A.M.B. WOULD HAVE GOTTEN CRUSHED. FETTERMAN, THAT IS THE GUY YOU WANT.  Jeanine: I WANT TO HEAR FROM A DEMOCRAT WOMAN, WHAT YOU THINK OF KAMALA, IS SHE PRESIDENTIAL MATERIAL?  Jessica: SHE HAS VICE PRESIDENTIAL MATERIAL. LISTEN, I HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN MS, KAMALA HARRIS WAS NOT MY CHOICE IN THE PRIMARY, HE WAS NOT THE CHOICE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE, GO AND VOTE, WHY SHE DROPPED OUT FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE HUGE HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTERS, AND IT WAS A BIG ISSUE THAT DID NOT FEEL SHE WAS WORTHY OF THAT MANTLE, THAT SHE WAS AS STRONG A CANDIDATE AS HILLARY CLINTON WAS, BUT WHAT I WILL SAY, EVERYONE ALWAYS TALKS ABOUT HER, WHAT DOES SHE DO? SHE DOESN'T GET ANYTHING DOES COME SHE IS IN CHARGE OF THE BORDER, ROOT CAUSES, YOU KNOW WHAT ISSUE SHE WAS IN CHARGE OF? ABORTION. SHE WAS THE ONE WHO IS OUT FRONT IN THE ADMINISTRATION, TALKING ABOUT THE THREAT TO WOMEN, ESPECIALLY --  Greg: WHAT A STRETCH.  Jesse: YOU GET ALL THE CREDIT, KAMALA.  Jessica: PEOPLE TALK ABOUT JOE BIDEN'S LEGACY, THEY TALK ABOUT SAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND HE WAS IN CHARGE OF THAT.  Jesse: THE CRIMES HE HAS COMMITTED OVERSEAS.  Jessica: YOU DO, BUT NORMAL PEOPLE TALK ABOUT --  Jesse: WHAT DOES THE SECOND GENTLEMAN DO ALL DAY?  Jessica: THE SAME THING WHEN A LADY DOES THE JOB -- HE PEES STANDING UP, THAT IS DIFFERENT.  Jesse: HE DOESN'T HAVE OTHER THINGS GOING ON?  Jessica: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?  Jesse: I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT HE DOES ALL DAY.  Greg: THIS IS FOR \"PRIME TIME.\"  Jesse: WE ARE GOING TO LOOK INTO THAT.  Greg: SECOND GENTLEMAN, WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN?  Jesse: NOT EVEN JOKING.  Greg: I KNOW YOU ARE.  Jesse: \"ONE MORE THING\" IS UP NEXT. \u266a \u266a . 20221110225423.058|20221110225812.154",

Neil: DOES THAT FLY WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, TO DONALD TRUMP? IT'S TIME TO STEP OFF THE STAGE?  YES. HOUSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF CANNOT STAND. INDEED, THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY.  Neil: ALL RIGHT. THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA MAKING IT CLEARS THAT SHE THINKS THE PARTY SHOULD BE DONE WITH DONALD TRUMP. SHE CALLED INTO QUESTION THE RACES THAT WE SAW ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT WERE LOST BECAUSE OF DONALD TRUMP. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA FEELS THE SAME WAY, GLENN YOUNGKIN, BUT SHE'S AMONG MORE PROMINENT REPUBLICANS THESE DAYS THAT HAVE BEEN SAYING CERTAINLY THE TIMING OF A TRUMP ANNOUNCEMENT NEXT WEEK, PRESUMABLY TO ANNOUNCE ANOTHER BID FOR THE PRESIDENCY SHOULD BE AT THE VERY LEAST PUT OFF. OTHERS SAY PERMANENTLY. SENATOR SHELLY MOORE CAPITO IS HERE IN THE FLESH. I WAS TALKING TO YOU REMOTE. GREAT TO HAVE YOU. THE GREAT STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA. HER DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTER WERE HERE. ALL RIGHT YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER WAS BOARD. SHE WENT TO LOOK AT CARTOONS.  SHE'S READY NOR THE BIG SCREEN.  Neil: I THINK SO, TOO. LET ME ASK YOU WHAT YOU'RE HEARING ON THIS AND THE FRUSTRATION AMONG SOME REPUBLICANS, THAT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS CANDIDATES MIGHT HAVE COMPROMISED A WINNABLE GETTABLE SENATE?  I THINK RIGHT NOW TODAY, THE ELECTORATE IS FATIGUED. THEY'RE TIRED OF CAMPAIGNING. SO I THINK TO TURN AROUND AND START TALKING ABOUT 2024 IS A LITTLE TOO SOON.  Neil: TOO SOON FOR YOU IF YOU WERE ADVISING DONALD TRUMP --  I WOULD THINK SO. THERE'S A LOT OF INTEREST ON OUR SIDE. OTHER NEXT BESIDES FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP TO RUN. SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A BIG FIELD. I ALSO THINK WE HAVE LOOKS LIKE A RUN-OFF COMING. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN NEVADA YESTERDAY.  Neil: AND GEORGIA.  AND GEORGIA. SO I'M HOPING FOR GOOD RESULTS THERE, WHICH I THINK WILL DECIDE WHAT KIND OF MOMENTUM WE HAVE GOING INTO THE NEXT SESSION AND HOW THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES WILL REACT TO THAT. SO I THINK IT'S A WAIT AND SEE TYPE OF SITUATION. BUT I DO THINK THAT THE ELECTORATE IS TIRED. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE WHAT THE FOLKS IN GEORGIA WILL FEEL LIKE FOR ANOTHER FOUR WEEKS.  Neil: I HEAR YOU. ONE THING I FOUND INTERESTING, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID LET'S WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE MID-TERMS TO KNOW. NOW WE KNOW A RUN-OFF ELECTION IN GEORGIA. THAT IS PUSHED OFF TO DECEMBER 6. NOW, DO YOU THINK THAT ANY CANDIDATE, THE FORMER PRESIDENT INCLUDED SHOULD WAIT TILL DECEMBER 6?  I WOULD THINK SO. CANDIDATES DO MATTER. IT IS A MESSAGE THAT YOU HAVE TO CARRY AND IT'S TOUGH. THERE WERE A LOT OF ISSUES OUT THERE. INFLATION AND JOB LOSS AND THE BORDER, THE ABORTION ISSUE. ALL OF THESE ISSUES VERY HOT BUTTON ISSUES. A TOUGH CAMPAIGN. SOME OF OUR CANDIDATES FELL SHORT.  Neil: DID THEY FALL SHORT BECAUSE THEY WERE TRUMP PICKS OR --  YOU CAN'T APPEAL I DON'T THINK TO THE SMALL -- TO A LARGE PORTION OF ONE PARTY AND EXPECT TO WIN. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BROADER APPEAL. THAT'S WHERE WE FELL SHORT.  Neil: YOU MIGHT TAKE THIS -- AFTER ALL, THREE OF THOSE STATES, ARIZONA, NEVADA COULD GO YOUR WAY. GEORGIA IS A MOOT POINT. BUT IT IS CLOSE. THE HOUSE ENDS UP BEING VERY CLOSE. WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENS?  WHAT DO I THINK HAPPENS GOING FORWARD?  THE SURGE AND ALL THAT.  PEOPLE TOOK THEIR POSITIONS AND STAYED WITH THEM. THE INDEPENDENTS SPLIT 50/50, I THINK. NORMALLY WHEN YOU HAVE A PRESIDENT THAT HAS UNPOPULARITY, DISAPPROVAL RATINGS, YOU'LL SEE THAT MIDDLE, THAT INDEPENDENTS SWING TO THE OPPOSING PARTY. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN IN THE NUMBERS THAT WE NEEDED IT TO. SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE FELL SHORT. YOU KNOW, PENNSYLVANIA, I'M RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO PENNSYLVANIA IN WEST VIRGINIA. PENNSYLVANIA IS NOT EXACTLY A RED STATE. HATS OFF TO PAT TOOMEY FOR GETTING ELECTED THERE. THAT IS A TOUGH STATE FOR ANY REPUBLICAN. AND SO I'M NOT SURPRISED --  Neil: MEHMET OZ WAS THAT BAD OF A CANDIDATE BY SOMEONE THAT PERFORMED MISERABLY AND DIDN'T MATTER.  AND THE PRESIDENT MAKING COMMENTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE COAL PANTS. PENNSYLVANIA IS THE SECOND LARGEST PRODUCER OF NATURAL GAS AND HE STILL WON. A LOT OF THE VOTES WINTERLY BEFORE THE DEBATE. THAT'S SOMETHING TO LOOK AT FOR FUTURE ELECTIONS WHEN LEGISLATURES GET -- MAKE THOSE DECISIONS.  Neil: YOU AND YOUR FELLOW SENATOR DOS REGROUP, SENATOR, IS IT TOO EARLY TO START TALKING ABOUT WHAT SHOULD BE YOUR LEADER? MITCH McCONNELL'S NAME COMES UP THAT HE WOULD BE A GOOD SENATE MAJORITY LEADER. DONALD TRUMP MADE IT CLEAR RICK SCOTT, ANYONE BUT MITCH McCONNELL. WHERE ARE YOU ON THIS?  I'M IN MITCH McCONNELL'S CAMP AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN. HIS BOOK THE CALLED \"THE LONG GAME.\" LEADER McCONNELL CAN LOOK SO MUCH FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO STRATEGY, TO FIGURING OUT THE BEST WAY ON A VERY NARROW 50/50 SPLIT. THAT IS TOUGH STUFF. THE OTHER THING I THINK THAT SENATOR McCONNELL HAS DONE FOR ALL OF US AND CERTAINLY I'M INCLUDED, HE WILL TAKE THE INCOMING FIRE. HE WILL MAKE THE TOUGH DECISIONS FOR US AS A CONFERENCE AND AS REPUBLICANS AND BE THE MESSENGER FOR THAT. THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT IN A LEADER. OF THE 50 OF US LOOKING OUT FOR THE REST OF US.  Neil: SO NO MATTER WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS ABOUT IT -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE SAID, IF HE WERE THE LEADING AND PASSING ALONG LEGISLATION, HE WOULDN'T PAY ATTENTION TO HIM. YOU CONTINUE DO THAT, CAN YOU?  YOU KNOW WHAT? DONALD TRUMP IS NOT ONE OF THOSE 50. SENATOR McCONNELL HAS -- HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE 50, HOPEFULLY 51. THAT'S HIS CONSTITUENCY RIGHT NOW. COUNT ME IN ON HIS TEAM.  Neil: REAL QUICKLY, ON PRESIDENT BIDEN, HE'S HAT NOT BUDGED ON A LOT OF ISSUES. HE THINK DEMOCRATS DID BETTER THAN THEY FEARED AND HE DOESN'T HAVE TO. HIS ATTACK ON COAL IS PRETTY STILL ON. I JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT.  FOR MY STATE THAT IS DEVASTATING. WE'RE JUST NOW DIGGING OUT FROM THE OBAMA BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN ALMOST WORSE IN TERMS OF THE REGULATORY NO PERMITTING. WE HAVE A MOUNTAIN VALLEY PIPELINE THAT IS 95% COMPLETED THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION WON'T LET GO FORWARD. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING. YET WE'RE GOING TO BEG OTHER COUNTRIES FOR MORE NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION. THE PRESIDENT IS READING THE WRONG TEA LEAVES HERE. THE BORDER SITUATION, THE CRIME SITUATION, ALL THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW ARE IMPORTANT. CHANGES ARE IN THE AIR AND HE NEEDS TO MAKE THEM.  Neil: WE'LL WATCH CLOSELY. SENATOR SHELLY MOORE CAPITO. YOU HAVE TO WAKE YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER UP NOW. VERY GOOD SEEING YOU IN THE FLESH.  THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON.  Neil: WE ARE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON POLITICAL STORMS, BUT ONE THAT WAS BREWING AND IS NOW SWEEPING THROUGH FLORIDA. COULD HAVE BEEN A LOT WORSE. NICOLE IS NO IAN, BUT STILL SHE PACKED A PUNCH. WE'RE ON THAT AFTER THIS. 20221110212650.039|20221110212955.107",

        "trs": " Martha: ALL RIGHT. WELCOME BACK TO THE ONGOING ELECTION. NO MATTER WHO WINS CONTROL OF CONGRESS FOR 2023, THEY WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE INFLATION MONSTER AND DO SOME BATTLE WITH IT. IT'S NOT GOING AWAY YET. IT CAME IN AT 7.7%, WHICH WAS OFF THE HIGHS, BUT IT'S STILL A FAR CRY FROM THE 1.4% WHEN THE PRESIDENT STARTED OR THE 2%, WHICH IS THE TARGET. THE ECONOMY AND JOBS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR ALMOST HALF OF AMERICANS THAT VOTED IN THE FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS. GERRI WILLIS AND LAUREN SIMONETTI ARE HERE WITH US. GERRY, GREAT TO SEE YOU BOTH.  GREAT TO SEE YOU.  Martha: GERRIE, LET'S START WITH YOU. IT WASN'T ABOUT INFLATION AND THE ECONOMY AND CRIME. THE NUMBERS SHOW THAT WAS THE NUMBER 1 ISSUE.  IT'S THE NUMBER 1 ISSUE AND A REAL DISCONNECT IN THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION WITH THE NUMBERS WE'RE SEEING TODAY WITH A BETTER REPORT. REMEMBER, THAT 7.7% NUMBER, THE TOP LINE NUMBER FOR CPI, COMPARE THAT TO WAGE GAINS. 4.7%. SO STILL IN THIS SITUATION, INDIVIDUAL WAGES ARE NOT KEEPING UP WITH INFLATION. YOU'VE GOT TO THINK THAT THE PEDAL WILL HIT THE METAL SOON. THERE COULD BE OTHER ISSUES LIKE ABORTION. THAT WAS AN ISSUE THAT PLAYED OUT IN THIS ELECTION. THE ECONOMY, I DON'T THINK IT'S GETTING BETTER ANY TIME SOON. IF IT DOESN'T HIT THIS ELECTION, PERHAPS 2024.  Martha: ALL RIGHT. LET'S JUST DIP INTO THIS. THE PRESIDENT IS TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY RIGHT NOW. WE'LL TAKE A SECOND OF THIS. WATCH.  ELECTRIC RAIL ALL ACROSS AMERICA. IT'S GOING TO TAKE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD, REDUCING POLLUTION. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S HIGH SPEED INTERNET IN EVERY HOME IN AMERICA. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY REALIZE WE MEANT WHAT WE SAID, LEAD PIPES START BEING PULLED OUT OF SCHOOLS, DAY CARE CENTERS, HOMES ACROSS AMERICA. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS IN JANUARY WHEN SENIORS WITH DIABETES ON MEDICARE ONLY HAVE TO PAY $35 A MONTH INSTEAD OF $400 A MONTH FOR INSULIN. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BIG CORPORATIONS PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE. A 15% TAX. ISN'T THAT TERRIBLE? YA'LL PAY MORE THAN THAT. LOOK, IN 2020, THE 55 LARGEST -- OF THE 55 OF THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA PAID ZERO ON $40 MILLION IN PROFITS. THOSE DAYS ARE OVER. WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN NEW FACTORIES ARE BEING BUILT IN COMMUNITIES WITH AMERICAN WORKERS MAKING THE MOST ADVANCED COMPUTER CHIPS IN THE WORLD. THAT WILL CREATE THOUSANDS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS. JOBS BETWEEN 120 AND 125,000 A YEAR. YOU DON'T NEED A COLLEGE DEGREE TO DO THEM. LOOK, YA'LL MADE THIS POSSIBLE. WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. WE SAW EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS IN THESE MID-TERM ELECTIONS THAT NOBODY THOUGHT POSSIBLE. MORE INDEPENDENTS VOTED FOR DEMOCRATS. YOUNG PEOPLE VOTED IN HISTORIC NUMBERS. YOUNG PEOPLE VOTED TO CONTINUE ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS, GUN VIOLENCE, PERSONAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOM, STUDENT DEBT RELIEF. ALL OF THOSE THINGS. AS I SAID, WOMEN IN AMERICA MADE THEIR VOICES HEARD, MAN.  Martha: OKAY. THE PRESIDENT TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY. LAUREN SIMONETTI, IS HE RIGHT? THE ECONOMY THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAVE PUT IN PLACE ARE STILL NOT BEING FELT AND THAT ONCE THEY'RE FELT, THINGS WILL GET BETTER?  I THINK HE THINKS THE MID-TERMS SENT A MESSAGE THAT HIS POLICIES ARE A-OKAY AND HE'S DOUBLING DOWN AND WILL WANT TO DO MORE. HE SPOKE ABOUT THE YOUTH VOTE COMING OUT. YEAH, THEY WERE PROMISED $10,000 IN STUDENT DEBT RELIEF. YEAH, FREE STUFF IS POSSIBLE. BECAUSE LIFE IS SO EXPENSIVE RIGHT NOW. RIGHT? IS THE ECONOMY GETTING BETTER? THE FED WILL FRY TO BREAK THINGS TO GET THE 7.7 INFLATION RATE DOWN TO 2%. THEY'RE BREAKING THE HOUSING MARKET. MORTGAGE RATES AT 7% RIGHT NOW. RENT, THE BIGGEST ANNUAL INCREASE OF 7.5%. A QUARTER OF AMERICANS RENT. THE BIGGEST INCREASE SINCE 1982. RENT IS STICKY. IT GETS NEGOTIATED ONCE A YEAR. DOESN'T COME DOWN. THIS WINTER, DO YOU WANT TO HEAT YOUR HOME? FUEL OIL PRICES ARE UP 68% IN THE PAST YEAR. ALL OF THAT IS STILL WITH US. I DON'T SEE ANY OF THAT COMING DOWN SOON.  Martha: THEIR APPROACH HAS BEEN IF YOU CAN LOWER CERTAIN DRUGS -- ONLY TEN DRUGS THAT ARE ON THE LIST THAT WILL BE COMING DOWN. RIGHT? ONLY TEN DRUGS THAT CAN BE NEGOTIATED. IF YOU HAPPEN TO USE ONE OF THOSE TEN DRUGS AND THAT'S NOT EVEN UNTIL NEXT YEAR, GERRI IS NODDING --  YEAH.  Martha: SO YOU KNOW, THESE THINGS THAT HE SAYS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO FEEL, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL FOR SOME TIME. ONE OF THE THINGS I FIND INTERESTING, YOU TALK ABOUT THE $10,000. THERE'S A LOT OF GIVE-AWAY. THE GIVE-AWAY REALLY CHANGED THE JOB MARKET. LOOK AT THIS FROM THE PEOPLE FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE. INDUSTRIES THAT RECEIVED LARGER PPP LOANS THAT GOT MORE MONEY, EXPERIENCED ELEVATED QUITS. PEOPLE LEAVING THEIR JOBS. THE MORE PP THAT CAME IN, THE MORE PEOPLE QUIT THEIR JOBS. EVEN 12 MONTHS AFTER THE PPP DISBURSEMENT. SUGGESTING THE AVAILABILITY OF THOSE FUNDS PREVENTED USUAL REALLOCATION FROM HAPPENING AND SUBSEQUENTLY CREATED A PENT-UP DEMAND FOR LABOR MARKET REALLOCATION. PEOPLE QUIT BECAUSE THEY GOT PAID NOT TO WORK IS THE MEANING THERE.  IT'S THE GREAT RESIGNATION. PEOPLE LEFT THEIR JOBS, THEY SAT AT HOME, THEY TOOK EARLY RETIREMENT. YOU SEE IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. NOW THEY'RE GETTING SLAMMED WITH THE WORSE INFLATION WE HAVE SEEN IN 40 YEARS. THE ONLY PEOPLE CELEBRATING TODAY'S NUMBERS ARE WALL STREET. THE MARKETS ARE CELEBRATING BECAUSE THEY THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT THE FED WILL SLOW DOWN IN TERMS OF RAISING RATES. BUT IF YOU'RE AT HOME, AS LAUREN SAYS, YOU'RE SEEING HIGHER PRICES NOR SO MANY THINGS. A COUPLE OF CATEGORIES DECLINED IN THIS REPORT. WE SAW LOWER PRICES FOR -- HELP ME OUT HERE.  AIR FARE WENT DOWN A LITTLE BIT. GOODS, CLOTHING. SERVICES ARE STILL HIGH.  Martha: REALLY HIGH PRICES FOR CORE. YOU TAKE OUT ENERGY, YOU TAKE OUT THE REALLY VOLATILE ELEMENTS OF CPI, WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT CORE INFLATION IS GROWING. THAT IS SUPER STICKY. THAT IS WHAT THE EXPERTS USE TO FORECAST FUTURE INFLATION. THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE HIGHER NUMBERS AND THEY'RE SAYING THIS IS GOING TO BE WITH US FOR A LONG, LONG TIME. I SPOKE TO AN ECONOMIST SAYS HE SEES THE NUMBERS GOING HIGHER AND HIGHER.  Martha: AND THE FED IS NOT DUMB IS WHAT I'M HEARING. EVEN THOUGH WALL STREET IS CELEBRATING TODAY -- MAYBE WE CAN PUT THIS NUMBER UP. IT'S UP 1,100 POINTS. THE FED IS PROBABLY HAS A FEW MORE RATE HIKES IN THEIR QUIVER.  WE SAW 475 BASIS POINT HIKES IN A ROW. THAT IS TREMENDOUS. IF YOU HAVE A BALANCE ON YOUR CREDIT CARD RIGHT NOW, THE API HIT A RATE OF OVER 19%. LET'S SAY YOU LOSE YOUR JOB BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM AMAZON AND WE HEARD FROM META, FACEBOOK. YOU'RE JUST HANGING ON. YOU HAVE TO PAY THAT BALANCE. YOU'RE PAYING ALL OF THESE HIGH PRICES FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON TO PUT GIFTS UNDER THE CHRISTMAS TREE. LET'S SAY YOU CAN'T PAY THEM OFF, THAT IS A HUGE DEAL RIGHT NOW.  Martha: THANKS, GUYS. GREAT TO SEE YOU BOTH. SO COMING UP ON THE ISSUE OF THE ECONOMY, ELON MUSK HAS A DIRE ASSESSMENT THAT HE REPORTEDLY MADE CLEAR TO THE STAFFERS THERE TODAY. HOWIE KURTZ ONLY ON \"THE STORY\" NEXT. 20221110204720.202|20221110205137.426",

THE STORM HAS BEEN DOWNGRADE I HAD BACK TO A TROPICAL STORM AFTER MAKING LANDFALL OVERNIGHT. IT KNOCKED OUT POWER FOR 300,000 PEOPLE. VERY RARE NOVEMBER HURRICANE LED TO EVACUATIONS AND SHUTTING DOWN OF AIRPORTS AND THEME PARKS. HOPEFULLY THE WORST IS BEHIND PEOPLE.  Bill: WE WAIT FOR A WET WEEKEND. SO MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE ON THE HILL. WHICH PARTY TAKES CONTROL OF THE HOUSE AND SENATE. IF REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE IS KEVIN MCCARTHY THE NEXT SPEAKER? CHAD PERGRAM HAS THE NEWS THIS MORNING AND READING THE TEA LEAVES IN D.C. GOOD MORNING.  CONGRESSIONAL CLIFFHANGER ALSO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI. FOR REPUBLICAN STEVE SCALISE WILL NOT CHALLENGE MCCARTHY.  I'M SUPPORTING KEVIN. I THINK KEVIN WILL WIN NEXT WEEK AND WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT GETTING TO WORK. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO FOCUS ON THE DRAMA IN WASHINGTON. WE'RE GOING TO GET TO WORK FOR THE HARD WORKING FAMILIES WHO GAVE US THIS MAJORITY.  CONJECTURE CONSERVATIVES COULD SEEK AN ALTERNATIVE TO MCCARTHY. MCCARTHY MAY HAVE OVERPROMISED. FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBERS COULD EXTRACT GUARANTEES FROM MCCARTHY ON SPENDING OR IMPEACHMENT. THAT'S IN EXCHANGE FOR THEIR VOTES. THEN LORD THAT OVER MCCARTHY.  THEY WILL WANT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE HIM DOWN IF HE BECOMES -- THAT'S A SWORD HANGING OVER HIM. IT HAS THWARTED OTHER SPEAKERS AND CAUSED SPEAKER BOEHNER TO RESIGN. THAT'S A LARGER PROBLEM NOW WITH THE NARROW MAJORITY FOR HIM.  DEMOCRATS ARE CAUTIONING REPUBLICANS AGAINST PUSHING TOO HARD ON INVESTIGATIONS OR EXTREME BILLS ABOUT THE BORDER AND ABORTION.  WE PICKED UP RACES THAT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE PICKED UP, EITHER, BECAUSE THERE WERE RAZOR THIN MARGINS. PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND THE VITRIOL AND HATE.  WHEN IT COMES TO PELOSI'S FUTURE SHE MAY NOT SAY ANYTHING UNTIL HOUSE RACES ARE SETTLED. WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHAT PELOSI WOULD DO ONE SENIOR HOUSE DEMOCRAT REPLIED WHO THE BLANK KNOWS? THEY DID NOT USE THE WORD BLANK.  Bill: I BET.  Dana: WOW.  Bill: OVERUSE OF THE WORD BLANK. THANK YOU, CHAD.  THANK YOU.  WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE TO REPUBLICANS WHO ARE CONSIDERING INVESTIGATING YOUR FAMILY AND PARTICULARLY YOUR SON HUNTER'S BUSINESS DEALINGS?  LOTS OF LUCK IN YOUR SENIOR YEAR AS MY COACH USED TO SAY. I THINK THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WANTS US TO MOVE ON AND GET THINGS DONE FOR THEM. IT'S ALMOST COMEDY. I CAN'T CONTROL WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO.  Dana: PRESIDENT BIDEN SEEMED TO MOCK HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO SAY THEY WILL INVESTIGATE HIS SON HUNTER'S BUSINESS DEALINGS SHOULD THEY TAKE BACK THE MAJORITY. LET'S BRING IN BYRON YORK. IT HAS BEEN BUILDING SINCE 2020, THE MONTH BEFORE THE ELECTION WHEN THE HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP STORY WAS SUPPRESSED BY BIG TECH AND 51 NATIONAL SECURITY OFFICIALS SAID IT WAS DISINFORMATION. THIS HEARING IS GOING TO HAPPEN.  ABSOLUTELY IT IS. THE PRESIDENT TRIED TO SOUND KIND OF CAVALIER ABOUT THE WHOLE THING. GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. BUT THE FACT IS IF REPUBLICANS DO TAKE CONTROL OF EITHER HOUSE OF CONGRESS, THERE ARE GOING TO BE HUNTER BIDEN HEARINGS. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WILL SAY HUNTER BIDEN IS NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE IS NOT EVEN A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS? WELL, CONGRESSS INVESTIGATED THE CHILDREN OF PRESIDENTS. A FEW YEARS AGO IN 2019 THE HOUSE SUBPOENAED DEUTSCHE BANK FOR THE FINANCIAL RECORDS OF DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR, ERIC DONALD TRUMP, IVANKA TRUMP AND EARLIER TRUMP JUNIOR HAD TESTIFIED IN THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION. THIS SORT OF THING HAPPENS A LOT. WHAT REPUBLICANS WILL BE LOOKING AT IS HUNTER BIDEN'S BUSINESS DEALINGS SPECIFICALLY HIS FOREIGN BUSINESS DEALINGS AND MORE SPECIFICALLY HOW THOSE MAY HAVE INTERSECTED WITH HIS FATHER. IT WILL BE A JOE BIDEN INVESTIGATION MORE THAN A HUNTSER BIDEN INVESTIGATION.  Dana: WE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES. THE PRESIDENT GAVE THE PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY. YOU HAVE WATCHED MANY PRESIDENTS AND OBSERVED THEM AS THEY USUALLY DO LOSE SEATS IN A MID-TERM. PRESIDENT BIDEN'S REACTION YESTERDAY.  President Biden: I WILL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO REUNITE THE COUNTRY. HARD TO SUSTAIN YOURSELF AS A LEADING DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD IF YOU CAN'T GENERATE SOME UNITY. SO I'M NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING IN ANY FUNDAMENTAL WAY.  Dana: HE SAID HE WANTED TO COMPROMISE AND HEARD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND NOT GOING TO CHANGE. HOW WILL THAT WORK?  IT WAS VERY ODD. HE STARTED OFF FINE SAYING HE WOULD COMPROMISE. HE THREW SOME BONES TO HIS BASE AND SAID THERE ARE SOME THINGS I AM ABSOLUTELY NOT GOING TO COMPROMISE ON LIKE ABORTION AND SOCIAL SECURITY. ON OTHER STUFF WE CAN COMPROMISE AND WORK TOGETHER WITH REPUBLICANS. THEN ASKED THIS SIMPLE QUESTION WHAT DO YOU PLAN TO DO DIFFERENTLY AND HE SAID NOTHING, WHICH WAS JUST A REAL SURPRISE. I THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS IF AGAIN REPUBLICANS TAKE OVER EATS HOUSE OF CONGRESS, MORE LIKELY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. IF THE PRESIDENT HAS A LEGISLATIVE AGENDA FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS IT IS DEAD. NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SO WHAT YOU SEE SOMETIMES IN THESE SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS NO REAL HOPE OF THE PRESIDENT PASSING ANY BILL THAT HE REALLY WANTS IS THEY PUT FORTH CALLED MESSAGING BILLS. BILLS THAT APPEAL TO A PARTY'S BASE. THEY KNOW THEY WILL NEVER GET PASSED BUT GET TO SAY WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS AND THE TERRIBLE REPUBLICANS ARE STOPPING US. THAT CAN BE VALUABLE IN A CAMPAIGN. THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE IT VERY CLEAR DESPITE HIS ADVANCING AGE, HE WANTS TO RUN AGAIN IN 2024.  Dana: HE SAYS HE WILL TALK TO HIS FAMILY BETWEEN THE HOLIDAYS BUT SEEMS TO ME THEIR MINDS ARE MADE UP. I WONDER, BYRON, IF THE MINDS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ARE STILL UNDECIDED.  I'M NOT SURE THEY ARE UNDECIDED. WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF POLLS WITH SIGNIFICANT MAJORITIES OF DEMOCRATS WHO SAY THEY WANT SOMEBODY ELSE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AS A DEMOCRAT IN 2024. NOW SOMEBODY ELSE IS A BROAD CATEGORY, NOT A SPECIFIC PERSON THEY WOULD PREFER OVER JOE BIDEN. SO PERHAPS IF THE CHOICE ACTUALLY CAME DOWN TO A JOE BIDEN VERSUS A SPECIFIC DEMOCRAT, BIDEN WOULD DO BETTER. BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT HE WILL BE 82 YEARS OLD AT THE END OF THIS TERM AND IF HE WERE ELECTED HE WOULD BE 86 AT THE END OF THE SECOND TERM. THIS IS COMPLETELY UNCHARTED TERRITORY IN AMERICAN HISTORY AND A LOT OF PEOPLE BELIEVE THEY CAN WATCH THE PRESIDENT SLOWING DOWN BEFORE THEIR EYES. AGE IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE.  Dana: I FEEL IT. I WAS ONLY UP FOR 24 HOURS ONE DAY AND IT WAS A LOT. BYRON YORK, GOOD TO SEE YOU.  Bill: A NEW TWIST FOR TWITTER. WHAT THE NEW OWNER ELON MUSK IS TELLING WORKERS ABOUT THEIR OWN FUTURE. A DEEPLY MOVING DOCUMENTARY THAT YOU MUST SEE. A U.S. MARINE AND HIS SELFLESS GIFT TO SAVE HIS COMRADES.  PUT HIS HELMET AND JUMPED ON TOP OF ME. IT WAS BEYOND BELIEF.

Dana: THE NEW INFLATION NUMBERS COMING IN GIVING AMERICANS ALITTLE RELIEF IN THEIR POCKETS BOOKS. IT IS UP 7.7% FROM A YEAR AGO. MEANTIME INFLATION UNDER THE BIDEN PRESIDENCY GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION PUTTING BASICS LIKE FOOD AND GAS FURTHER OUT OF REACH FOR SO MANY. MARIA BARTIROMO IS HERE TO BREAK IT DOWN.  IT WAS A GOOD NUMBER. NICE TO SEE A LITTLE RELIEF ON THIS. WE DO ACTUALLY NOW HAVE EVIDENCE THAT WE'RE COMING OFF OF THE HIGHS. I DON'T THINK WE'VE PEAKED. I DO THINK THIS IS A ONE-MONTH NUMBER AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE THIS PRESSURE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COMPONENTS WITHIN THIS NUMBER YES, YEAR-OVER-YEAR UP 7.7% VERSUS AN ESTIMATE OF 8%. LOOK WHERE YOU HAVE SHELTER AND RENT. RENT IS CONTINUING TO SKYROCKET. THAT'S NOT SHOWING ANY SIGNS OF ABATEMENT. SOME AREAS OF FOOD ARE ALSO ACTUALLY WORSE THAN LAST YEAR SO LIKE WHEN YOU LOOK FOR EXAMPLE GASOLINE UP 17 1/2%, ENERGY OVERALL UP 17% IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER. THAT WAS A VERY BAD NUMBER. LOOK WITHIN FOOD, A DOZEN EGGS UP 43% YEAR-OVER-YEAR. SO YES, THINGS ARE --  Bill: CHICKENS ARE COMING HOME TO ROOST.  IT'S A BETTER NUMBER THAN EXPECTED. NICE TO SEE BUT DOES NOT TO ME INDICATE THAT WE'RE OUT OF THE WOODS BY ANY MEANS.  Bill: LAST WEEK JEROME POWELL SAID WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO. WE'LL SEE HOW THAT GOES. OUR VOTER ANALYSIS. YOU WERE WITH US ON ELECTION NIGHT. OUR VOTER ANALYSIS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE ECONOMY AND JOBS 48%. OKAY, ABORTION AT NINE, IMMIGRATION NINE, CLIMATE CHANGE EIGHT. ECONOMY AND JOBS AT 48%. DO YOU THINK THAT SHOWED UP IN THE RESULTS?  I THINK THAT ABORTION WAS A BIGGER ISSUE TO THE DEMOCRATS THAN MANY OF US GAVE IT CREDENCE BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW INFLATION AND ECONOMY AND JOBS ARE THE NUMBER 1, 2, 3 ISSUES. SO I THOUGHT THAT ABORTION SORT OF KNOCKED DOWN A FEW PEGS. DEMOCRATS DID NOT FEEL THAT WAY. THAT WAS A DARK HORSE ISSUE. YES, I THINK THAT INFLATION WAS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE VOTED ON BUT THERE WAS A BIG PORTION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ONE-ISSUE VOTERS AND THAT WAS THE DEMOCRATS AND THEY WANTED TO, YOU KNOW, HAVE THEIR VOICE HEARD ON ABORTION.  Dana: THERE WAS THIS OTHER ONE, CALL FOR NUMBER TWO. THE REASON FOR INFLATION, 55% OF PEOPLE SAYING BIDEN'S POLICIES. 45% SAYING OUTSIDE HIS CONTROL. HE SAYS HE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING.  I COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT HE SAID HE IS WILL NOT CHANGE ANYTHING. WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE VOTERS REACT TO ISSUES. YOU SEE A PRESIDENT GO TO THE MIDDLE AND SAY I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU. HE IS STILL ATTACKING PORTIONS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND HE SAYS HE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE ANYTHING. I THINK THAT AT THIS POINT, YOU ARE SEEING INFLATION CONTINUING TO BE AN ISSUE. I THINK THAT IS GOING TO BE THE MAIN ISSUE. BUT LOOK, YOU'VE GOT KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES GOING INTO THE HOLIDAYS AND WE'LL SEE THIS IMPACT SPENDING. WE WILL ALSO SEE THE JOBS PICTURE CATCH UP. SO FAR JOBS HAVE BEEN REAL PLENTIFUL. WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE OR GET A JOB, THESE ARE SERIOUS ISSUES. SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING AWAY. I THINK IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN ISSUE GOING INTO THE HOLIDAYS. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT DEMAND. DEMAND IS WEAKENING BECAUSE INFLATION IS KUHNT INTO IT. WHAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IS THE SUPPLY SIDE OF THE STORY. JUST MAKING STUFF. GOODS. THIS PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO ALIENATE INDUSTRY. HE IS THREATENING A WINDFALL TAX FOR THE ENERGY COMPANIES. NO WONDER ENERGY PRICES ARE UP 17% IN OCTOBER. NO WONDER OIL PRICES ARE ACTUALLY HIGHER THAN WHERE THEY WERE WHEN HE STARTED SELLING OIL FROM THE STRATEGIC RESERVE. SO YOU'VE GOT TO START MAKING STUFF. YOU HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE SUPPLY SIDE OF THINGS ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE ON THE DOORSTEP OF A POTENTIAL RAIL STRIKE.  Bill: TAKE US INTO 2023. IT IS LATE JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MAYBE YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT ABOUT THESE NUMBERS NOT GETTING MUCH BETTER. KEVIN MCCARTHY IS THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. YESTERDAY BIDEN SAID I'M WILLING TO COMPROMISE. HE DID SAY THAT AT THE TOP OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE. WHAT WOULD THEY COMPROMISE ON WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY? WHAT POLICIES?  THEY HAVE TO COMPROMISE ON STOPPING THE RECKLESS SPENDING. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT $5 TRILLION IN BORROWING AS INTEREST RATES GO HIGHER, THAT BORROWING IS GOING TO BECOME MORE EXPENSIVE. THAT'S JUST ADDING TO THE PRESSURE ON AMERICAN FAMILIES THAT THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY HIGHER TAXES TO PAY FOR ALL OF THIS BORROWING. ONE COMPROMISE COULD BE THAT THEY WILL AGREE TO STOP THE SPENDING. I WOULD EXPECT 2023 IS GOING TO BE A VERY TOUGH YEAR ECONOMICALLY. I SAID THE OTHER DAY WHEN I WAS WITH YOU, I EXPECT A DOUBLE DIP RECESSION. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE NEGATIVE READINGS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY QUARTER OF 2023. SO YOU DON'T HAVE THINGS LIKE LARRY SUMMERS TALKING ABOUT STAGFLATION. THESE ARE NOT COINCIDENCES. THEY ARE SEEING WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES AND SEEING PEOPLE'S SAVINGS ACCOUNTS BEING TAPPED INTO JUST TO PAY FOR THE ESSENTIALS. FUEL, FOOD, RENT. THEY STILL ARE AT VERY ELEVATED LEVELS. FEDERAL RESERVE WILL RAISE RATES AGAIN. EXPECT A HALF POINT HIKE. 2023, WHILE IT IS GOING TO BE A NEW DAY, IT IS ALSO GOING TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS WHERE WE ARE. IT WILL LIKELY BE RECESSION.  Bill: DON'T LIKE THAT.  Dana: YOUR GUEST THIS MORNING, YOU WERE ASKING A LOT OF THEM IF THEY THINK THERE WILL BE A DOUBLE DIP RECESSION.  KEVIN HAS YET SAID WE'LL SEE EVERY SINGLE QUARTER NEGATIVE FOR 2023. JASON SMITH GOING TO LIKELY BE THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE IS TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY WEAKENING. YEAH, I THINK EVERYBODY ON THAT PANEL IS EXPECTING THAT 2023 WILL BE A TOUGH ROAD.  Bill: IMPORTANT STUFF AND YOU'LL TAKE US THROUGH IT. WE'LL GET A BUMP WHEN THE MARKET OPENS.  700 POINTS HIGHER RIGHT NOW.  Bill: THANK YOU SO MUCH. REPUBLICANS NOW INCHING CLOSER TO HOUSE MAJORITY. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE OR WHEN IT LANDS. WHAT CAUSED REPUBLICANS TO FALL SHORT OF EXPECTATION, NO SHORTAGE OF ANALYSIS ON THAT AGAIN TODAY. NICOLE IS A TROPICAL STORM GOING TO HAMMER FLORIDA THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND GO UP THE EAST COAST FOR A NOR'EASTER THIS WEEKEND IN NEW YORK PERHAPS. WE'LL TAKE YOU THERE COMING UP.

        "trs": " A COUPLE SHARKS MOVING ON THE STREETS. [LAUGHTER]  Dana: INCREDIBLE VIDEO FROM HUTCHINSON ISLAND, FLORIDA. SHARKS SWIMMING OVER A ROAD AFTER FLASH FLOODING THERE MORE THAN 320,000 PEOPLE IN FLORIDA ARE WITHOUT POWER AS TROPICAL STORM NICOLE BATSS THE STATE WITH STORM SURGE, HEAVY RAINS AND A COUPLE OF SHARKS. PHIL KEATING IS LIVE IN MELBOURNE, FLORIDA WITH THE VERY LATEST. HI, PHIL.  GOOD MORNING, DANA. THE ONLY SHARKS HERE ARE LAND SHARKS. THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE RAGING SURF OUT THERE. RIGHT NOW TROPICAL STORM NICOLE IS POUNDING CENTRAL AND WEST COAST OF FLORIDA RIGHT NOW WITH HEAVY RAINS AND WINDS. SOME OF THOSE WINDS STILL MAXING OUT AT 60 MILES-PER-HOUR. IT CAME ASHORE OVERNIGHT AS A CATEGORY 1 HURRICANE. IN BETWEEN FORT PIERCE AND VERO BEACH. POWER IS OUT. NO ELECTRICITY FOR AN ESTIMATED QUARTER OF A MILLION PEOPLE. THAT INCLUDES THIS ENTIRE BARRIER ISLAND WE'RE ON. THAT'S A LIVE WIRE JINGLING FROM THE UTILITY POLL AND WHY FIREFIGHTERS ARE HERE TO KEEP ALL THE LOOKERS FROM GETTING THEMSELVES ELECTROCUTED. EVERY INTERSECTION RIGHT NOW NO RED, YELLOWS OR GREENS. POWER IS OUT MAKING ALL THOSE INTERSECTIONS NON-FUNCTIONAL AND FOUR-WAY STOPS. 500 MILES END-TO-END IS THE WIND FIELD FOR THIS STORM. THAT IS ESSENTIALLY THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE STATE. THE SKYWAY BRIDGE ON THE WEST COAST SOUTH OF ST. PETERSBURG IS CLOSED RIGHT NOW AS WINDS EXCEED 50 MILES-PER-HOUR. ANYWHERE BETWEEN 3 AND 8 INCHES OF RAIN EXPECTED THROUGHOUT THE DAY. NEAR CAPE CANAVERAL WIND GUSTS REACHED 90 MILES-PER-HOUR. A LOUD AND HOWLING NIGHT FOR MANY. DIFFICULT TO SLEEP THROUGH IT. DAYTONA BEACH MAJOR BEACH EROSION IS THREATENING MULTIPLE HOMES. SO MUCH SAND WAS SWALLOWED UP BY THE STORM SURGE AND CRASHING WAVES THE BUILDINGS ARE ON THE VERGE OF FALLING INTO THE ATLANTIC. CONDO DO YOUERS WERE EVACUATED FOR NOT BEING STABLE OR SAFE ENOUGH. 2 TO 4 FEET OF STORM SURGE CAME ASHORE LAST NIGHT AT HIGH TIDE AND WHY MANY COUNTIES IMPOSED MANDATORY EVACUATIONS. TORNADOES REMAIN A SERIOUS CONCERN THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS THE STORM MARCHES NORTH THROUGH GEORGIA AND THE CAROLINAS.  Dana: STAY SAFE. BE AWARE OF THE LOOKERS.  Bill: THE BALANCE OF POWER IN CONGRESS IS UP IN THE AIR. REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO MAKE GAINS IN THE HOUSE. HOPES OF A RED WAVE NEVER REACHED THE SHORELINE. THE SENATE ALSO A TOSS-UP AS SOME CRITICS BLAME POOR CANDIDATES AND THEY BLAME A FORMER PRESIDENT. FORMER RNC COMES DIRECTOR AND A POLLSTER FOR THE -- DOUG, KARL ROVE WRITES IN THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" A NUMBER OF PIECES ON THE EDITORIAL PAGE TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, TALKING ABOUT THE RESULTS. HERE IS ROVE'S TAKE. WITH NO RED WAVE TRUMP IS OUT AT SEA. THE GOP FIELDED TOO MANY NOVICES WHO STRUGGLED CRAFTING A MESSAGE AND WAGING EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGNS. SOME WERE KNUCKLE HEADS. MANY OF THESE WEAK CANDIDATES CAME COURTESY OF DONALD TRUMP WHO DID NOT VET HIS ENDORSEMENTS. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT POINT?  YES. WE COULD GO BACK TO 2010 AND 2012 WHERE WE SAW A LOT OF THESE TERRIBLE FIRST-TIME CANDIDATES THAT CAUSED SENATE RACES TO FALL BY THE WAYSIDE IN NEVADA, DELAWARE, INDIANA, MISSOURI. THIS IS WHY MITCH MCCONNELL WAS WARNING WELL IN ADVANCE WE HAVE A CANDIDATE QUALITY PROBLEM. WE'VE SEEN AN INTENSIFICATION OF THIS PROBLEM FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. HOUSE AND SENATE CANDIDATES, SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDATES AND GOVERNORS AND THE LIKE. IT IS WHAT I CALL THE MY PILLOWIZATION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE HAVE ATTRACTED THE MORE CARTOON CHARACTERS. IF SOMEBODY SPEAKING AT A RALLY WITH A PRESIDENT OR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS BEST KNOWN AS A PILLOW SALESMAN RUN TO HIGH HEAVEN. YOU WILL SEE MORE CARTOON CHARACTERS TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF THE PARTY BECOME INSTAGRAM INFLUENCERS AND CELEBRITIES MORE THAN THEY ARE ABOUT BEING SERIOUS LEGISLATORS. THERE IS A REASON MADISON CAWTHORN LOST THE PRIMARY IN NORTH CAROLINA. HE SAID I'M NOT SERIOUS.  Dana: THE VOTERS DID VOTE THEM IN, RIGHT? THEY CHOSE THEM. IT WASN'T JUST THE ENDORSEMENT, RIGHT? I THINK -- I'M CURIOUS DID DEMOCRATS LEARN ANYTHING FROM THE RESULTS THAT MAKE YOU THINK WOW, THIS REALIGNMENT OF BOTH PARTIES CONTINUES. I WAS REALLY AMAZED AT THE YOUTH VOTE AND INCREASES THERE. CAN DEMOCRATS HOLD ONTO THOSE? WHAT DOES IT MEAN IF YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR REPUBLICANS WHAT THEY SHOULD THINK ABOUT FOR 2024?  CANDIDATE QUALITY HURT REPUBLICANS ESPECIALLY IN KEY SENATE AND GUBERNATORIAL RACES WHERE TRUMP'S HANDPICKED CANDIDATES STRUGGLED OR LOST IN RACES THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE BEEN WINNABLE. THAT BEING SAID, ABORING WAS A HUGE ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS AND REALLY HAD HELPED PEOPLE TURN UP. DEMOCRATS WERE CRITICIZED LEADING UP TO MID-TERM ELECTIONS SPENDING TOO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT ABORTION AND NOT SPENDING ENOUGH TIME TALKING ABOUT INFLATION AND ECONOMY. IT TURNS OUT TALKING ABOUT ABORTION HELPED THE DEMOCRATS AVOID WHAT WAS EXPECTED TO BE HUGE LOSSES IN THE MID-TERMS. WE SEE THAT IN SOME OF THE EXIT POLLS THAT ABORTION WAS A TOP ISSUE FOR VOTERS AND EVEN ABOVE THE ECONOMY IN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA AND MICHIGAN.  Bill: REPUBLICANS THE GOVERNORS RAN AWAY WITH THE RACES. RON DESANTIS AND MIKE DEWINE AND ABBOTT IN TEXAS, KEMP IN GEORGIA. NOT MUCH OF A CHALLENGE WITH STACEY ABRAMS DESPITE ALL THE ATTENTION THAT RACE GOT DESPITE THE MONEY THAT WENT INTO THE RACE AS WELL. HERE IS MARCO RUBIO LAST NIGHT ON THESE WHAT HE SEES AS REPUBLICAN SHIFTS WITH SEAN HANNITY.  PEOPLE ARE MOVING HERE THEY WANT TO GET AWAY FROM THE LUNACY. IT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING TO PEOPLE THAT DON'T IDENTIFY WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WHO DON'T WANT SCHOOLS INDOCTRINATEING THEIR KID. FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE WITH SOCIALISM AND DON'T WANT IT IN THIS COUNTRY. PUT THOSE ISSUES AHEAD AND THEY'LL PUNISH THEM.  HE IS RIGHT ABOUT THAT IN FLORIDA AND ALSO IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN THE HOUSE SEATS. I WAS LOOKING AT NUMBERS FROM A FEW YEARS AGO. ANDREW CUOMO WON AN ELECTION IN NEW YORK BY 29 POINTS. WHO KNEW? THAT'S ASTOUNDING. ZELDIN LOST BY FIVE. HIS POINT IS WELL TAKEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CONGRESSIONAL RACES.  THE FACT THAT THE ZELDIN RACE WAS AS CLOSE AS IT WAS HELPED OTHER REPUBLICANS HAVE VICTORIES IN WAYS WE EXPECTED. WE WERE TOLD IT WOULD BE A WAVE. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS DON'T SAY A YEAR IN ADVANCE YOU'LL HAVE A WAVE. DON'T SAY THE WORD TSUNAMI. YOU BUILD EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE UNREALISTIC. SAY WE'LL TAKE IT ONE RACE AT A TIME AND DO OUR BEST AND GOOD LORD WILLING WE'LL GATE MAJORITY. THEN YOU CAN BE EXCITED ABOUT A HOUSE MAJORITY INSTEAD OF HAVING YOUR PARTY FEEL LET DOWN.  Dana: BIDEN SAID EVEN 80% OF THE COUNTRY IT'S GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION HE SAID HE WON'T CHANGE ANYTHING. IS THAT SUSTAINABLE?  AT THE END OF THE DAY AS LONG AS THE REPUBLICANS HAVE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, WHICH IS WHAT WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN, IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. HE WILL HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT HE IS NOW HAVING TO NEGOTIATE WITH NOT HAVING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN POWER. SO HE IS, YOU KNOW, RIGHT TO YOUR POINT THE EXPECTATIONS WERE SUCH THE DEMOCRATS WOULD HAVE A HUGE LOSS AND WORTH NOTING THAT THEY DIDN'T. IT WASN'T THIS WAVE THAT THERE WAS A TALK ABOUT. AT THE SAME TIME THINGS WILL BE DIFFERENT WITH THE REPUBLICANS HAVING CONTROL OF THE HOUSE.  Bill: WILL SLOW THINGS DOWN CERTAINLY. THERE IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT PLANNED OR EVENT PLANNED FOR NEXT TUESDAY ON BEHALF OF FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. WHAT DOES HE DO? DOES IT HAPPEN OR IS IT DELAYED?  I DON'T THINK ANYBODY KNOWS. TRUMP DOESN'T KNOW. WHAT WE KNOW FROM MAGGIE'S REPORTING TRUMP IS MAD AT MAR-A-LAGO AND BLAMING EVERYBODY FOR THE DR. OZ ENDORSEMENT INCLUDING MELANIA. NOT A GREAT PLACE TO BE.  Dana: YOU KNOW WHAT? HE WILL DECIDE WHAT HE WANTS TO DO. WE'LL FIND OUT IF IT HAPPENS ON TUESDAY.  Bill: SOME PEOPLE SAYING THE WALKER RACE IN GEORGIA WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT, STAY OUT OF THE WAY OF THE EVENT WALT OF THAT VOTE.  THIS IS WHERE CANDIDATE QUALITY MATTERS. MITCH MCCONNELL IS MINDFUL OF TRUMP -- WE'VE LOST SENATE MAJORITIES BEFORE BECAUSE OF TRUMP. IT IS STILL WINNABLE IN GEORGIA.  Dana: A WILD SCENE IN THE STREETS OF LOS ANGELES. POLICE AFTER A DRIVER HAVING THREE CRASHES. KATHY HOCHUL NOT JUST A CLOSER THAN EXPECT EDWIN AMID A BARRAGE OF CRIME IN THE EMPIRE STATE. WE WANT YOU TO HEAR FROM A GRIEVING MOTHER ON A MURDER VICTIM ON WHAT SHE IS HOPING FOR.  THE MOTHERS, THE FAMILIES OF THESE VICTIMS CARE NOTHING ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE THEORIES. WE CARE ABOUT RESTORING LAW AND ORDER TO OUR CITY. 20221110143959.613|20221110144441.027",

        "trs": " I WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE MILLIONS OF LATINOS WHO ARE WATCHING ME AT HOME TONIGHT -- REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU VOTED, ESTE ES TU PARTINO. WE'RE THE PARTY THAT WANTS HISPANICS TO PROSPER, NOT DEPEND ON THE GOVERNMENT. WE ARE THE PARTY THAT UNDERSTANDS THAT HIS PAN INS DO NOT WORSHIP GOVERNMENT. WE WORSHIP GOD.  LAURA: THAT WAS CONGRESSWOMAN EL ELECT MONICA DAY LA CRUZ WHO MADE HISTORY BY BECOMING THE FIRST REPUBLICAN TO WIN TEXAS'S 15th DISTRICT, EVER. THERE ARE RACES LIKE THAT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. IOWA'S THIRD DISTRICT, REPUBLICAN ZAK NUNN FLIPPED THE SEAT DEFEATING SYDNEY AXNEY. DESCRIBED AS A PAINFUL LOSS FOR THE DEMOCRATS BY \"THE NEW YORK TIMES.\" DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN VIEWING THE RESULT AS A HUGE VICTORY. THEY'RE LIKELY TO LOSE THE HOUSE AND CONTROL OVER MAJOR COMMITTEES AND LOSING RISING STARS IN THE PROCESS. JOINING US IS CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT MONICA DAY LA CRUZ AND IN IOWA, CONGRESSMAN ELECT, ZACH NUNN. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR VICTORIES. YOU RAN FANTASTIC CAMPAIGNS. MONICA, WE'RE GOING TO START WITH YOU. WHY DID YOU SUCCEED? SOME DIDN'T SUCCEED, REPUBLICANS WHO WANTED TO FLIP SEATS, BUT YOU DID. IN TURNING YOUR DISTRICT FROM DEMOCRAT TO NOW SOLIDLY REPUBLICAN IN THIS TURNOUT.  WELL, I THINK THAT OUR SUCCESS STARTED IN THE 2020 ELECTION WHEN WE RAN FOR THE FIRST TIME AND SWUNG THIS DISTRICT 18 POINT. IT WAS HISTORIC BECAUSE I WAS RUNNING BY TO -- EXCUSE ME, I WAS RUNNING AGAINST AN INCUMBENT. WE NEVER STOPPED RUNNING. SINCE 2020. AND I THINK THAT THE NAME RECOGNITION HELPED. THE FACT THAT WE DID SO WELL, WE SCARED THE INCUMBENT OUT OF THE DISTRICT. AND MADE IT ABOPEN SEAT WAS EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL FOR US TO GET OUR MESSAGE OUT TO THE VOTERS. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT CAME DOWN TO TWO THINGS -- NO. 1, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S DISASTROUS ECONOMIC POLICY, COUPLED WITH THE BORDER -- THE OPEN BORDERS THAT HE HAS CAUSED IN HIS ADMINISTRATION. THAT IS AFFECTING OUR BORDER PATROL AGENTS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THOSE THREE THINGS HELPED US PUSH OUR CAMPAIGN ACROSS THE LINE. THIS 2022 ELECTION.  LAURA: WOW, IT'S VERY EXCITING. AND IN IOWA, WELL, THIS IS FASCINATING. BECAUSE IOWA HAS BEEN A STALWART ON TWO THINGS NUMBER ONE, GETTING GOVERNMENT OFF YOUR BACK. NO. 2, THEY WERE GREAT ON HANDLING COVID. AND, ZACH, HOW DID YOU DO IT. HOW DID YOU CONTINUE THE SUCCESS THAT YOUR GOVERNOR OBVIOUSLY SAW IN GETTING RE-ELECTED.  LAURA, IT'S BEEN FANTASTIC, HERE IN IOWA LIKE TEXAS AND FLORIDA, CONGRATULATIONS TO MONICA ON HER INCREDIBLE VICTORY THERE. WE EXPERIENCE IOWA, A PERPETUAL PURPLE STATE HAD CLEAR CHOICES. WHAT WORKS IN GOVERNMENT, KIM REYNOLDS. GUYS FROM THE HEARTLAND, WE WAKE UP EARLY, BUT WE'RE NOT WOKE. THATE ARE SOUNDED WITH FOLKS WHO WANT TO SEE THEIR KIDS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM, SEE COMMUNITY AND COPS WORKING TOGETHER. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO START OUR ECONOMY. WE'RE ONE OF THE FIRST ONES THAT OPEN BACK UP. STATES LIKE IOWA, I'M A STATE SENATOR AND COMBAT VETERAN HAVE SEEN IOWA ONE OF THE BEST STATES RECOVER FROM COVID. WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THESE THINGS FROM PLAYBOOK OUT TO WASHINGTON, D.C. AND SHOW THEM HOW LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE DONE THIS EFFECTIVELY WHEREAS THE TAX AND SPEND AGENDA OF BOTH PRESIDENT BIDEN AND NANCY PELOSI AND CINDY AXNE THE FORMER INCUMBENT WE BEAT LAST NIGHT HAD TAKEN TO THE GOVERNMENT WOULD BE THE ONLY SOLUTION WE'RE GOING TO OFFER TO IOWIANS AND THEY SHOWED. NO, NOT ON OUR WATCH. TRUST IOWIANS AND AMERICANS AND THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL.  I WAS SO THRILLED TO SEE THAT. SHE WAS PEGGED AS A BIG RISING STAR FAR THE PARTY. IT WAS A CLOSE RACE. VERY CLOSE. YOU KNOCKED HER OFF.  YEAH, PRETTY CLOSE.  IT'S GOOD TO BE ABLE TO BEAT INCUMBENTS. IT CAN CHANGE THE COURSE.  LAURA: I WANT TO ASK BOTH OF YOU AFTER WE PLAY THIS SOUND BITE FROM A SAGE COMMENTATOR ON MSNBC ABOUT AMERICA FIRST CONSERVATISM, TRUMP ENDORSED BOTH OF YOU, WATCH.  TRUMPISM IS DEEPLY ENTRENCHED IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. TO DO IT SOLELY TO ELECTION DENIALS IS A MISTAKE. DESANTIS IS PUTTING MIGRANTS ON BUSES AND PLANES. THE MIAMI HERALD SAID THIS SHOULD BE A DISQUALIFIER FOR ELECTION AND FLORIDA VOTERS CAME OUT. YES, HE MAY NOT BE CARRYING WATER ON THE BIG LIE. BUT THERE'S STILL SO MUCH OF TRUMPISM THAT HE'S BRINGING TO HIS CAMPAIGN.  LAURA: THE BREATHLESS COMMENTARY. ISN'T IT JUST PRAGMATIC CONSERVATISM, THE ONE IN FLORIDA WINNING IN TEXAS, THE ONE IN IOWA. MONICA, WE'LL START WITH YOU. IS IT PRAGUE MATTISM AND POPULISM?  LOOK, AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE VOTERS ARE SAYING THEY WANT COMMON SENSE LEGISLATION. THEY WANT THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO HELP THEM BE PROSPEROUS, BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. LOOK, AS A SINGLE MOM MYSELF, I KNOW THAT SINGLE MOMS OUT THERE, IN ALL OF AMERICAN FAMILIAR AREALLIES ARE STRUGGLING. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THANKS GIVING COMING UP AND HOW THEY CAN AFFORD A TURKEY. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BASICS AT THIS POINT. AND I BELIEVE THAT COMMON SENSE AND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HITTING PEOPLE IN THE WALLET, THAT'S WHAT DROVE PEOPLE TOWARDS CONSERVATIVE CANDIDATES SUCH AS MYSELF.  ZACH, DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?  YEAH, YEAH. IT'S A SOLID POINT HERE. WE'RE A FAMILY OF FOUR. TWO FOSTER KIDS IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ELECTION CAMPAIGN. WE SAW THE IMPACT IT HAD ON THE CHILD CARE SIDE. I TALKED TO MY KID'S PRESCHOOLTEACHER AND SHE SAID SHE BOUGHT A PIZZA AND FILLED HER CAR UP WITH GAS. IT WAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE DATE NIGHT SHE HAD WITH HER HUSBAND SINCE HER HONEYMOON. THESE ARE REAL IMPACTS ON PEOPLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A FARMER TO FILL UP WITH DIESEL THIS FALL TO SHOW HOW MUCH THE IMPACT REDUCES YOUR ABILITY TO BE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS, SUCCESSFUL FARMER OF JUST YOUR FAMILY TO GET THROUGH THE WEEK. THIS DID RESONATE AT THE BALLOT BOX. WE DIDN'T SEE ANY SOLUTIONS BEING OFFERED BY THE LEADERSHIP ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE. I WILL COMPLIMENT THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP FOR COMING UP WITH A COMMITMENT TO AMERICA ON TANGIBLES THAT THE NEW CONGRESS CAN WORK DAY ONE TO START DELIVERING.  MONICA, ZACH, CONGRATULATIONS TO BOTH OF YOU. WE'LL BE WATCHING YOU CLOSELY WHEN WE GET TO WASHINGTON.  LAURA: EVERYONE RUNNING FOR PUBLIC OFFICE SHOULD AVOID IF THEY WISH TO WIN. THE UNSEEN FACTOR THAT TIPPED THESE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. THAT'S NEXT. UNSEEN SEGMENT WHERE WE EXPOSE THE FORCES THAT SHAPED THE MIDTERMS. RAY, YOU HAVE SOME LESSONS FOR THOSE SEEKING PUBLIC OFFICE IN THE FUTURE.  YOU KNOW, THESE MIDTERMS WERE INSTRUCTIVE, LAURA. THERE WAS MUCH TO LEARN FROM THE CANDIDATES WHO DIDN'T MAKE IT. FIRST RULE, DON'T TRY SINGING AT A CAMPAIGN EVENT IF YOU CAN'T SING. THIS IS DON BOLDUC -- \u266a COUNTRY ROADS TAKE ME HOME TO THE PLACE I BELONG \u266a \u266a WEST VIRGINIA MOUNTAIN MAMA TAKE ME HOME COUNTRY ROADS \u266a  OH, BOY. MAY I RECOMMEND THE MASKED SINGER FOR HIM. UNLESS YOU'RE AUDITIONING FOR DANCING WITH THE WANNABE STARS WHICH COULD BE CAREER OPTIONS FOR THE NEXT TWO CANDIDATES, DON'T DANCE IN PUBLIC LIKE STACEY OR BETO. \u266a THICK IN HIPS COME GET IN MY CAR THE LONG HAIRED STAR, THE THICK IN THE HIPS, COME GET IN MY CAR. \u266a  I DIDN'T KNOW --  QUALIFYING FOR OFFICE, LAURA. HOW DOES THAT PROVE YOUR LEADEVERSHIP ABILITY? I ASK YOU? LAURA: REMEMBER, OBAMA COULD SING. WHEN HE SANG AL GREEN, HE HAS A GOOD VOICE. BUT --  HE WON THE OFFICE BY THAT POINT, THOUGH.  LAURA: THAT'S TRUE.  HE WASN'T CAMPAIGNING.  THIS IS STILL WHAT THEY'RE DECIDING.  THE MOST VEXING MOMENT OF THE NIGHT CAME OUT OF PENNSYLVANIA THAT BROUGHT YOU JOHN FETTERMAN. YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS WRONG WHEN A MAN WHO'S BEEN DEAD FOR A MONTH IS ELECTED STATE REPRESENTATIVE. TONY DeLUCA DIED LAST MONTH. HE WAS RE-ELECTED LAST NIGHT. YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS UP. AFTER FETTERMAN, LAURA, EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE.  LAURA: OKAY, THAT IS TERRIFYING. RAY, WHY DO YOU THINK THE RED WAVE FAILED TO MATERIALIZE?  LAURA, WHAT DID I SAY? I GOT NASTY EMAILS AND TWEETS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS. I SAID OVER AND OVER, LET'S GO BRANDON IS NOT A GOVERNING AGENDA. YOU NEED A CLEAR ACTIONABLE SERIES OF POLICIES THAT YOU CAN DEFEND AND ADVANCE. GIVE THE VOTERSOMING TO ASPIRE TO. THE GOP DIDN'T DO THAT. THEY HAVE THAT COMMITMENT TO AMERICA, BUT, LAURA, I WILL READ TWO QUICK GOALS -- ECONOMY THAT'S STRONG, A FUTURE BUILT ON FREEDOM. THOSE ARE NOT POLICY ACTION ITEMS. THOSE ARE JUST HOPES. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO -- THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MEAT THERE ON THE BONE. LAURA, WHEN YOU PEAL BACK THE POLLING DATA, IT WAS YOUNG VOTERS THAT GAVE THE DEMOCRATS THE ADVANTAGE. OF ALL OF THE AGE GROUPS, IT WAS GENZ WHO DELIVERED FOR THE DEMOCRATS. I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP. THEY MOSTLY LIVE WITH THEIR PARENTS. THEY VOTED 6 % OF THEM FOR DEMOCRATS, THAT'S PLUS 28 POINTS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AND MAY HAVE BLUNTED THE RED WAVE THAT CAME FROM OTHER GROUPS.  LAURA: I THINK A LOT OF THE YOUNGER PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, THE LOCKDOWN WASN'T MAYBE SO BAD, RIGHT? FOR THEM? THEY GOT TO --  HMM.  LAURA: GOT TO ORDER UBER EATS AND CATCH UP ON THE NETFLIX AND GET THEIR CHECKS.  THE DEMOCRATS WERE ALSO VERY DELIBERATE IN THEIR PITCH TO YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY OFFERED THEM DRUGS, RECREATIONAL DRUGS, ABORTION, PAID OFF STUDENT LOANS. SO, THEY WERE, AGAIN, ACTIONABLE POLICIES THAT THEY WERE PROMISING TO ADVANCE AND CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THE GOP DID NOT GET IN THE MUD AND WRESTLE OVER ANY OF THESE ISSUES TRYING TO WIN THE YOUNG PEOPLE OVER. THAT WAS A MISTAKE. DESPITE THE SETBACK OF LOSING AT LEAST ONE HOUSE OF CONGRESS, BIDEN WAS BACK AT BEING THE OLD BIDEN APT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE TONIGHT, LAURA.  I'VE BEEN GIVEN A LIST OF TEN PEOPLE I'M SUPPOSED TO CALL ON. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO ASK ONE QUESTION, WHETHER OR NOT, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF, IN FACT, I THINK THE CONTEXT IS THAT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE PULLING BACK FROM FALLUJAH. AND THE -- I MEAN THE -- THE CITY OF KURSON BEING A -- A -- BY -- BIDEN'S BEING EXTREMIST.  OH, LAURA. CLARITY SHOULD BE THE MANDATE, I THINK, COMING OUT OF THESE MIDTERMS.  LAURA: THIS IS WHAT I'M SAYING, THE MSNBC GAL WAS LIKE, WOW HERSCHEL WALKER CANNOT STRING TWO SENTENCES TOGETHER. HAS SHE LISTENED TO BIDEN, FETTERMAN? COME ON. HE'S SOCRATES COMPARED TO THE OTHER TWO. COME ON. OF.  REMARKABLE.  LAURA: WHERE ARE YOU GOING NEXT, THE BOOK TOUR THAT NEVER ENDS.  BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA ON TUESDAY. NEW ORLEANS, SATURDAY. RAYMOND.COM. THE WISEMEN OF CHRISTMAS CONTINUES.   LAURA: NEW BATCHES OF VOTES ARE BEING DROPPED IN THE SENATE RACES IN NEVADA AND ARIZONA. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE GOP LEADERSHIP RACES.

WE NEED BETTER LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I PROMISED TO FIGHT FOR EVERY SINGLE DAY.  Bret: WINNERS AND LOSER THERE. BIG NIGHT LAST NIGHT. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE POLLS HAD RIGHT. WHAT THEY HAD WRONG AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING FROM THAT ELECTION. JEFF ROE FOUNDER OF AXIOM STRATEGIES AND DOUG SCHOEN FORMER CLINTON ADVISER AND DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER. GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.  THANK YOU.  Bret: LET'S GET 30,000 FEET A LOOK AT LAST NIGHT WHAT YOU TOOK FROM IT.  IRREMOVABLE OBJECT MET THE IRREVERSIBLE FORCE. WE LIKE TO HAVE ELECTIONS MIDTERMS TO BE A REFERENDUM BUT THE DEMOCRATS MADE IT A CHOICE THAT HURT SOME OF OUR GAINS. WE WANTED A SPLIT. WE HAVE ANOTHER ELECTION CYCLE TO TURN THAT PAGE.  Bret: DOUG, WHAT DID YOU TAKE FROM IT.  I THOUGHT IT WAS A VERY GOOD NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS GIVEN THE EXPECTATIONS BEFORE ELECTION DAY. BASICALLY, WE ARE A POLARIZED COUNTRY DEMOCRATS CAME OUT NOTWITHSTANDING THE NEWS THEY WERE FACING. VERY BIG WIN FOR JOE BIDEN PERSONALLY A GREAT NIGHT FOR RON DESANTIS. A PROBLEMATIC NIGHT FOR DONALD TRUMP GIVEN THAT MASTERS IS BEHIND IN ARIZONA DR. OZ LOST AND BOLDUC LOST IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND HERSCHEL WALKER IS TRAILING BY A POINT IN GEORGIA. SO, THAT'S WHAT I TAKE BUT JEFF'S VIEW IS BASICALLY RIGHT.  Bret: YEAH. PRESIDENT BIDEN JUST WRAPPED UP THIS NEWS CONFERENCE AND HE WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT HE TAKES FROM IT, WHAT CHANGE HE WOULD MAKE FROM IT. TAKE A LISTEN.  WHAT IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS DO YOU INTEND TO DO DIFFERENTLY TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S OPINION OF THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY AS YOU CONTEMPLATE A RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2024?  NOTHING. I BELIEVE WE TOOK THE RIGHT STEPS FOR THE COUNTRY AND FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IN FACT, IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS, OVERWHELMING MAJORITY -- I DON'T LOOK AT THEM MUCH ANYMORE BECAUSE I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW TO READ THEM ANYMORE. I HOPE YOU ARE UNCERTAIN AS WELL. BUT, OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUPPORT THE ELEMENTS OF MY ECONOMIC AGENDA.  Bret: NOW, IS THAT WHAT YOU TOOK FROM IT, DOUG?  NO. IT ISN'T. AND I DON'T THINK THEY DO. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT IT WAS A MOBILIZATION OF THE DEMOCRATIC BASE AROUND ISSUES LIKE ABORTION THE FACT THAT FORMER PRESIDENTS OBAMA AND CLINTON GOT INVOLVED TO GET OUT THE VOTE. AND THE REPUBLICANS, I THINK JEFF WAS RIGHT IN SUGGESTING DIDN'T CLOSE THE SALE. DIDN'T COME UP WITH THE KIND OF POSITIVE ARGUMENT THAT GOVERNOR DESANTIS SO COME PRESIDENTIALINGLY MADE IN FLORIDA.  Bret: THE ISSUES THAT WAS MOST IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE AND THE ECONOMY, JOBS, WAS NUMBER ONE BY FAR BUT NUMBER TWO IN OUR LIST WAS ABORTION DO YOU THINK THAT -- I HEARD YOU SAY IT'S A SHORT-TERM PLAY THAT MIGHT HAVE IMPLICATIONS LATER FOR DEMOCRATS.  YEAH. I THINK THEY ARE CREATING A REAL PROBLEM WITH THEIR BASE. HISPANICS ARE MORE PRO-LIFE THAN WHITES ARE. AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE MORE PRO-LIFE THAN THEY ARE REPUBLICANS. OBSESSION WITH TRUMP AND OBSESSION WITH ABORTION WILL COST THEM IN THE LONG TERM. AND LET'S MAKE IT CLEAR WE WON LAST NIGHT. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT FOR SURE IF WE WON ON DECEMBER 6TH IN GEORGIA IN THE SENATE. IT'S TOUGH TO BEAT AN INCUMBENT UNITED STATES SENATOR WHO IS GOING TO HAVE 150 MILLION BUCKS AT THEIR DISPOSAL AND AN OPERATION BASED ON TURNING OUT THEIR VOTERS THEY DID A NICE JOB OF THAT AND THAT HALTED SOME OF GAINS. TWO ISSUE PARTY. IT WILL HELP THEM WHEN 100 MILLION PEOPLE TURNING OUT. HELP THEM GET 150 MILLION OF THEIR VOTERS OUT. PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 125, 150 MILLION I THINK IT'S GOING TO COST THEM.  Bret: DO YOU THINK FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP COMES INTO THIS. HE COMES OUT THERE IS A RUMOR IS HE GOING TO DECLARE AT THE J.D. VANCE RALLY AND THE CLOSE TO DEMOCRATS IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE TOOK AS KIND OF A VEILED TRUMP REFERENCE. THEORETICAL ABOUT THE THREAT TO DEMOCRACY I DON'T THINK HE PLAYS IT NO MORE THAN PRESIDENT OBAMA PLAYS INTO IT. WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GETTING MORE VOTES THAN OUR OWN CANDIDATES. ASSET TO UTILIZE TO MOTIVATE YOUR BASE. EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT TURNED OUT FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP VOTED FOR OUR CANDIDATES LAST NIGHT WE WOULD HAVE WON OVERWHELMINGLY IT IS HARD TO MAKE THE CASE THAT HE HURTS FOR SURE. THERE IS AN ARGUMENT TO MAKE THAT CANDIDATES MATTER. THE DEMOCRATS HAD HEADWINDS TO FIGHT AGAINST AND WE HAD CANDIDATES THAT COULDN'T MAKE THE SALE. WHEN YOU ARE RUNNING UP AGAINST AN INCUMBENT UNITED STATES SENATOR OR INCUMBENT MEMBER OF CONGRESS WITH THAT MUCH MONEY, YOU BETTER PACK A LUNCH BECAUSE THEY ARE GOING TO BE TOUGH TO BEAT.  Bret: JEFF IS RIGHT, DOUG, THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THESE RACES ARE GOING TO GO YET. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THE DEMOCRATS COULD EKE OUT WINS IN NEVADA OR ARIZONA OR COULD GOT OTHER WAY AND GEORGIA THEN BECOMES THE CONTROL AS I POINTED ON THE MAP EARLIER. BUT NEXT CYCLE, DOUG, IT DOES NOT SET UP AS A GREAT ENVIRONMENT FOR DEMOCRATS AS YOU LOOK TWO YEARS DOWN THE ROAD.  YEAH. I AGREE WITH THAT AND WHERE I THINK JEFF IS EXACTLY RIGHT. THE DEMOCRATS NEED AN AFFIRMATIVE AGENDA BEYOND DEMOCRACY, ELECTION DENIAL BY DONALD TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES, THE ABORTION ISSUE AND STEADY AS WE GO. BIDEN HAS MADE REFERENCE TODAY TO BEING MORE BIPARTISAN, REACHING ACROSS THE AISLE. HE HAS GOT TO DO THAT IF HE WANTS TO HAVE A REAL SHOT AT RE-ELECTION, ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS A NOMINEE OTHER THAN DONALD TRUMP.  Bret: JEFF, DOUG, WE APPRECIATE IT.  THANK YOU.  Bret: VERY QUICKLY, GENTLEMEN, DID THE POLLS GET IT RIGHT? WRONG? WERE THEY WAY OFF? JEFF FIRST AND THEN DOUG?  YEAH. I THINK THEY ARE PRETTY CLOSE. WE HAVE A LOT OF ANTICIPATION AND A LOT OF ENERGY AT THE END THAT WASN'T REALLY REFLECTED IN THE POLLS. I THINK IT WAS WISHFUL THINKING ON OUR PART. BUT THE POLLS WERE PRETTY CLOSE TO BEING ON. AND SO THERE IS SOME LESSONS THOUGH IT'S VERY HARD AND GETTING VERY EXPENSIVE TO POLL PEOPLE THAT DON'T WANT TO ANSWER THE PHONE. AND WHEN YOU CALL 100 PEOPLE AND GET 1.7 TO ANSWER, WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE CONDUCTING POLLING FOR VERY MANY MORE CYCLES.  Bret: DOUG?  I WOULD JUST SAY, BRET, THAT WE HAVE SO UNDER POLLED REPUBLICANS FOR SO MANY YEARS ALL OF US IN THE BUSINESS THOUGHT THAT THERE WOULD BE A HIDDEN REPUBLICAN VOTE THIS IN MOST INSTANCES DID NOT SHOW UP AND MANIFEST ITSELF IN THE POLLS OR ON ELECTION DAY.  Bret: OVERCORRECTED MAYBE.  EXACTLY.  Bret: WELL, I'M JUST HAPPY TO NOT TALK ABOUT POLLS FOR A LITTLE WHILE.  ME TOO.  Bret: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, GENTLEMEN. APPRECIATE IT. UP NEXT, A LOOK AT THE BIG SENATE RACES STILL UNCALLED PLUS AN UPDATE ON THE GOVERNOR'S RACES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. \u266a 20221109232430.500|20221109232939.809",

PARADOXICALLY IT WAS A SURPRISING RESULT WITHOUT MANY SURPRISING RESULTS IF YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING THERE WEREN'T THAT MANY RACES WHERE PEOPLE SAID WHOA, THAT IS A STUNNER, MAYBE THE MARGINS IN FLORIDA WAS A BIG ONE. CERTAIN RACES WENT A CERTAIN WAY.  Bret: MAYBE FETTERMAN BY AS MUCH NOT A SHOCKER BUT AS MUCH AS HE DID.  I THINK THE OVERALL RESULT IS MORE SURPRISING THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL RESULT. AND AS I DIG DEEPER IN, AS OF RIGHT NOW, THIS COULD CHANGE IN A FEW DIFFERENT PLACES LIKE NEVADA, BUT, AS OF RIGHT NOW, NOT A SINGLE INCUMBENT SENATOR OR GOVERNOR IN THE COUNTRY LOST FROM EITHER PARTY. SO THIS WAS. ABOUT PRESIDENT BIDEN STATE OF THE COUNTRY. THIS WAS SOMEWHAT OF A STATUS QUO ELECTION EVEN THOUGH THE OPPOSITION PARTY STILL MIGHT WIN ONE OR BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS. A LOT OF STRANGE DISSIDENCE ABOUT THIS ONE.  Bret: YEAH, OLIVIA?  I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO HOUSE REPUBLICANS ALL DAY TODAY. YOU ARE SEEING ONE THING THEY ARE SAYING PUBLICLY. THEY FLIPPED THE HOUSE THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT. BEHIND THE SCENES POSTMORTEM OF WHAT WENT WRONG. THEY WERE SAYING I WAS FEELING THE ENERGY OF THESE VOTERS, TALKING ABOUT INFLATION AND CRIME. BUT MAYBE ABORTION WAS A BIGGER ISSUE AND THEY ARE TRYING TO ASSESS WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THEIR EVALUATIONS BECAUSE THEY REALLY DID BELIEVE THEY WERE GOING TO SEE A RED WAVE.  Bret: IS IT POSSIBLE, DAVID, THAT THAT CLOSE WITH THREAT TO DEMOCRACY HIT ON SOMETHING THAT WAS A BETTER CLOSE THAN WE THOUGHT IT WAS?  WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT SOMEBODY WHO GETS THEMSELVES ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE DOING. WE ALL LIKE TO SIT IN THE CHEAP SEATS AND LOOK AT POLLING AND SAYING THAT IS IDIOTIC WHY IS HE TALKING ABOUT THAT. I WILL TELL YOU I TRAVELED THE COUNTRY'S LAST SIX WEEKS, WISCONSIN, OHIO, WASHINGTON STATE, PENNSYLVANIA, NEVADA, GEORGIA, I TALK TO DEMOCRATS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AND WHEN I WOULD ASK DEMOCRATS WHAT THE ISSUE MOTIVATING YOU THEY WOULD TALK ABOUT KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES. I WOULD TELL YOU HOW MANY TIMES DEMOCRATIC ACTIVISTS KNOCKING ON DOORS AND DEMOCRATIC VOTERS TOLD ME I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE STATE OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. WHEN YOU WOULD LOOK AT THE POLLING IT WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT YOU WOULD TALK ABOUT INFLATION AND GAS PRICES AND HOW YOU ARE GOING TO ADDRESS AMERICANS' QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES. BUT WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT A MIDTERM ELECTION WHERE YOU NEED TO TURN OUT YOUR BASE AND, IN FACT, GIVE YOUR OWN VOTERS, EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT IN YOUR BASE, A RESEARCH TO SHOW UP, IF YOUR PRESIDENT BIDEN TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY AT LEAST AS A PART OF THE MENU OF ISSUES YOU ARE DISCUSSING, MAKES A WHOLE LOT OF SENSE AND I THINK THAT IT IS WHAT DEMOCRATS WANTED TO HEAR AND IT MAY BE WHY WE SAW A REAL ROBUST TURNOUT FROM DEMOCRATS WHICH YOU USUALLY DON'T SEE FROM THE PARTY IN POWER IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT IT'S ON ITS HEELS IN A MIDTERM ELECTION. USUAL LEAR THE OUT PARTY MAKES A LOT OF GAINS BECAUSE THE OTHER SIDE JUST DOESN'T SHOW UP.  Bret: YEAH. HERE IS PRESIDENT BIDEN. I WANT TO PLAY IT AGAIN BECAUSE IT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE WAS INTERPRETING, WHAT HE TOOK FROM THE ELECTION AND WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO. THIS IS A REPORTER QUESTION AND A LITTLE DIFFERENT PART OF HIS ANSWER.  WHAT IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS DO YOU INTEND TO DO DIFFERENTLY TO CHANGE PEOPLE'S OPINION OF THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY, PARTICULARLY AS YOU CONTEMPLATE A RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2024.  NOTHING. BECAUSE THERE IS JUST FINDING OUT WHAT WE ARE DOING. THE MORE THEY KNOW ABOUT WHAT WE ARE DOING, THE MORE SUPPORT THERE IS.  Bret: NOTHING, GUY? NOTHING? WRONG DIRECTION 75%. NOTHING? RECOMMENDATION HE IS SAYING WELL, LOOK, WE DIDN'T GET SHELL LACKED OR EVEN CLOSE TO IT KEEP DOING WHAT WE ARE DOING. I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN ANSWER THAT WILL PLAY WELL WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE. THIS WAS NOT AN ELECTION THAT WAS IN ANY WAY AN EMBRACE OF THE DEMOCRATS OR TRYING TO EMPOWER THEM FURTHER BUT ALSO VOTERS DID NOT GO RUNNING INTO THE OPEN ARMS OF THE OPPOSITION PARTY IN A MIDTERM ELECTION IN NIGHT OF ALL THE FUNDAMENTALS BEING AS BAD AS THEY ARE OR SHOULD BE FOR THE DEMOCRATS. THAT IS TO MARC THIESSEN'S POINT ON ELECTION COVERAGE LAST NIGHT REALLY AN INDICTMENT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY RIGHT NOW WHERE CERTAIN TYPES OF REPUBLICANS ESPECIALLY GOVERNORS DID QUITE WELL. EVEN MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED BUT OTHER TYPES OF REPUBLICANS WERE ULTIMATELY TOXIC TO AN AWFUL LOT OF VOTERS. AND THEY BETTER FIGURE IT OUT BECAUSE THERE IS ANOTHER ELECTION IN TWO YEARS AND I THINK THIS WAS JARRING ONE FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE EXPECTING TO WIN.  Bret: WE SHOULD POINT OUT THAT THERE IS STILL A POSSIBILITY THAT REPUBLICANS GAIN CONTROL OF BOTH CHAMBERS. AND THERE IS A PATH IN THE SENATE. THE PROJECTION NOW IS AND WE DON'T HAVE THIS NAILED DOWN BUT IT'S ROUGHLY 222 SEATS IN THE HOUSE FOR REPUBLICANS. WHICH IS THE SAME MAJORITY THAT DEMOCRATS HAD, WHICH IS VERY SLIM. IS THERE A THREAT TO LEADER McCARTHY POTENTIALLY SPEAKER McCARTHY IN THIS NEW CONGRESS IN THAT FORM?  IN THE PHONE CALLS THAT I HAVE HAD AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING WITH FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBERS AND PEOPLE ON McCARTHY WANTS RIGHT WING, THEY DON'T THINK THAT AT THE MOMENT THERE IS ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING TO CHALLENGE HIM. BUT HIS CHALLENGE IS IN ANOTHER FORM. FREEDOM CAUCUS IS LOOKING FOR CONCESSIONS ON INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES LIKE RESTORING THE MOTION TO VACATE THE CHAIR. AND I HAVE HEARD THAT HE HAS BEEN DOING SORT OF PHONE CALLS TRYING TO SEE HOW STRONGLY THAT RED SIDELINE WITH THESE FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBERS AS WELL AS OTHER SORT OF CONCESSIONS THAT FREEDOM CAUCUS IS PUSHING FOR LIKE HAVING SOME OF THEIR MEMBERS ON THE COMMITTEE THAT DECIDES HOT CHAIRMAN IS AND WHERE. GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES. WILL THAT SORT OF THREAT IS MAKING SURE. THE RED WAVE REALLY DID HIT IN FLORIDA. AND AXIOS WRITES IT THIS WAY. REPUBLICANS WIN BIG IN FLORIDA, FLIPPING LONG DEMOCRATIC MIAMI-DADE. TUESDAY'S ELECTION SERVES AS FURTHER PROOF THAT SOLIDLY RED FLORIDA PAST SWING STATE. DESANTIS WON THE MIAMI-DADE BECOMING THE FIRST GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE TO WIN THE COUNTY SINCE 2002. TODAY THE FORMER PRESIDENT POSTED THIS ON TRUTH SOCIAL AND NOW THAT THE ELECTION IN FLORIDA IS OVER AND EVERYTHING WENT QUITE WELL SHOULDN'T IT BE SAID THAT IN 2020 I GOT 1.1 MILLION MORE VOTES IN FLORIDA THAN RON D. GOT THIS YEAR. 5.7 MILLION TO 4.6 MILLION JUST ASKING. SURE, OKAY. LOOK. I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS IN THESE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, A LOT OF THE CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE AND FOR GOVERNOR THAT WERE RUNNING IN THE STYLE OF TRUMP, THAT HUGE HOLISTIC CULTURE WARRIOR FOUND THEMSELVES COMING UP SHORT. THE REPUBLICANS THAT DID WELL.  Bret: THE ONE WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT KARI LAKE IN ARIZONA.  CORRECT. AND BY THE WAY THERE WERE STILL PLENTY OF REPUBLICANS IN THE STYLE OF TRUMP THAT WON ELECTION THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE NEW HOUSE MAJORITY AND POSSIBLY THE NEW SENATE MAJORITY BUT I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT GOVERNOR -- LET'S LOOK AT GEORGIA WHERE I JUST RETURNED FROM, GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP WINS WITH 53 AND A HALF PERCENT OF THE VOTE. HE ROMPED. RIGHT? IN THE SAME ELECTION, IN THE SAME CONTEST, WHERE -- THE SAME STATE WHERE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATINGS WERE UNDER 40%, HERSCHEL WALKER IS BATTLING NECK AND NECK BEHIND IN A RUN OFF. HE RAN AS A CULTURE WARRIOR MORE SO THAN A KITCHEN TABLE ORIENT THE CANDIDATE. AND I THINK YOU SEE WHAT WORKS. WHAT WORKED LAST NIGHT AND WHAT DIDN'T.  Bret: WELL, WE WILL SEE YOU BACK IN GEORGIA DECEMBER 6TH. WE WILL SEE IF IT'S CONTROL OF THE SENATE. THANKS, GUYS. FINALLY TONIGHT, A PAIR OF \"SPECIAL REPORT\" SALUTES, FIRST, WE TAKE TO YOU ARIZONA, THEY ARE DOING SOME COUNTING THERE THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT.

        "trs": " Martha: WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE ELECTION LAST NIGHT. IT WILL HAPPEN A SHORT TIME FROM NOW. WE'LL SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY, WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S QUESTIONS TAKEN. THAT'S THE FIRST SOLO NEWS CONFERENCE THAT HE WILL GIVE ON U.S. SOIL SINCE JANUARY. SO WORD IS THEY'RE FIRED UP AT THE WHITE HOUSE. WE'LL SEE WHAT KIND OF TONE THE PRESIDENT TAKES. JOE CONCHA IS STANDING BY. FIRST TO LUCAS TOMLINSON AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH A LOOK AHEAD AT WHAT WE EXPECT TO UNFOLD HERE SHORTLY. HI, LUCAS.  THE PRESIDENT WILL HAVE HIS DAY AFTER ELECTION DAY NEWS CONFERENCE AT THE WHITE HOUSE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR. IT'S SCHEDULED FOR 4:00 P.M. EVEN AS VOTES COME IN. EDWARD LAWRENCE REPORTED, THE FEELING AT THE WHITE HOUSE IS VINDICATION AND EXCITEMENT. DEMOCRAT CANDIDATES RAN ON THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA AND DID NOT RUN AWAY FROM IT. THE ELECTION RESULTS CONSIDERED THE BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN. THE WHITE HOUSE FEELS DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES SPOKE TO THE ISSUES OF ABORTION, CLEAN ENERGY. NO DRILLING AND SCRAPPING THE COAL INDUSTRY COMMENTS RECENTLY. IT APPEARS PRESIDENT BIDEN'S STRATEGY OF NOT CAMPAIGNING IN BATTLEGROUND STATES BESIDES PENNSYLVANIA PAID OFF. THE FIRST LADY THAT WAS DISPATCHED TO THOSE STATES. JILL BIDEN CAMPAIGNED IN EIGHT BATTLEGROUND STATES. THE FINAL VOTES ARE STILL BEING COUNTED AND JUST THREE SENATE SEATS REMAIN UP FOR GRABS. RECALL MITCH McCONNELL'S DIRE WARNING. MOST GOP CANDIDATES DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP HAD A GOOD NIGHT. OTHERS POINTED TO STRONG WINS BY DESANTIS, SUNUNU AND DEWINE. LAST YEAR, THE DEMOCRATS GOT THE VOTES TO PAST THE $1.9 TRILLION COVID DEAL AND THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT.  Martha: THANK YOU. LUCAS TOMLINSON REPORTING FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. JOE CONCHA IS HERE. MEDIA AND POLITICS COLUMNIST FOR THE HILL. STRUCK ME AS LUCAS WAS REPORTING THAT NOT CAMPAIGNING SEEMS TO WORK WELL FOR JOE BIDEN.  WORKED IN 2020, WORKED AGAIN THIS TIME UNLESS YOU HEAR AND SEE FROM JOE BIDEN, THE LESS CLEANUPS ON AISLE 5, 6 AND 17. THE PRESIDENT'S HANDLERS HAVE DONE THIS AND HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE. HOPEFULLY THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE IN 2020 BELIEVING HE HAD A HUGE MANDATE HERE. RIGHT? LET'S THINK ABOUT THIS. RONNA McDANIEL BROUGHT IT UP EARLIER. THEY WON 14 SEATS IN 2020. THEY'RE PROJECTED TO WIN 13 TO 14 SEATS IN 2022. THAT IS 28 SEATS IN TWO YEARS GOING FOR THE GOP. THEY GET CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. SO WHILE IT'S NOT THE TWO TO THREE TOUCHDOWN VICTORY THAT SO MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN HERE, VICTORY IS STILL A VICTORY. IF HERSCHEL WALKER COULD WIN THAT RUN OFF, THEN THEY TAKE THE SENATE BY, IF WE KEEP USING THE FOOTBALL ANALOGIES, BY AN EXTRA POINT. SO YOU STILL LOSE THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE WHERE AT THE VERY WORST YOU LOSE THE HOUSE AND IT'S A 50/50 SENATE. DEMOCRATS AND THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T OVERPLAY THEIR HAND HERE TO THINK THAT THEY HAVE WON SOMETHING HERE.  GOOD POINTS. MAYBE YOU CAN POP UP THE MAP AGAIN. IF NEVADA GOES RED AND LET'S SAY ARIZONA POTENTIALLY GOES BLUE, SEEMS TO BE LEANING THAT WAY, WE HAVE NOT CALLED EITHER OF THOSE STATES AND WALKER WINS GEORGIA, YOU'RE AT 51 FOR REPUBLICANS. THEN THAT'S GOING TO TURN OUT TO BE A VERY DIFFERENT STORY. SO WE CAUTION EVERYONE, ELECTIONS TAKE TIME THESE DAYS AND THE NUMBERS ARE STILL COMING IN. IT'S INTERESTING THE PRESIDENT WILL -- WE'LL SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY. A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE TRUMP EFFECT ON THESE CANDIDATES. HERE'S WHAT SOME OF THE PUNDITS ON OTHER CHANNELS HAD TO SAY ABOUT IT. GET YOUR THOUGHTS.  WE SAID A LOSS, 57 SEATS EASY. AND THE REPUBLICAN IS REALLY DONALD TRUMP.  I THINK DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE FOR THE DEMOCRAT WHAT'S NOBODY COULD HAVE DONE FOR THE DEMOCRATS.  WHAT DO YOU THINK?  THE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO MAKE THIS A REFERENDUM ON DONALD TRUMP AND THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED TALKING AND JANUARY 6 AND THREATS TO DEMOCRACY SO MUCH. I LOOKED WHAT HAPPENED IN FLORIDA. WE DISCUSSED IT DURING THE BREAK. IT'S NOW THE UNITED STATES OF FLORIDA. IT'S LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT, IT'S ITS OWN COUNTRY. FOR RON DESANTIS TO WIN BY 20 PERCENT. 55% OF THE PUERTO RICAN AMERICAN VOTE. HE WON IN MIAMI-DADE. HE WIN THERE'S EASILY. YOU WONDER --  Martha: MARCO RUBIO BY 16 POINTS.  YEAH. DESANTIS DID NEED TRUMP IN ANY RALLIES. BRIAN KEMP IN GEORGIA ALSO DIDN'T NEED TRUMP. TRUMP IS A CRITIC OF HIS. WE SAW GLENN YOUNGKIN LAST YEAR. HE WON VIRGINIA WITHOUT DONALD TRUMP. SO YOU WONDER IF THE COMMON THREAD IS JUST LIKE WITH JOE BIDEN IS IT'S BETTER FOR THESE CANDIDATES TO NOT HAVE TRUMP THERE BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL VOTE AGAINST THE CANDIDATE AS MUCH AS THEY'RE VOTING NOR THE CANDIDATE. THAT MAKES SENSE?  Martha: WE'LL SEE. IT'S AN INTERESTING THEORY. WE'LL TALK TO KELLYANNE CONWAY IN JUST A MINUTE. GREAT TO SEE YOU ON THIS POST ELECTION DAY. KELLYANNE CONWAY AND DOUG SCHROEN BOTH IN THE HOUSE JOIN ME LIVE AFTER A FLORIDA TSUNAMI FOR GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS. THIS IS A HUGE PART OF THE STORY TODAY IN OUR POST ELECTION DAY COVERAGE NEXT.  THANKS TO THE OVERWHELMING SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA, WE NOT ONLY WON ELECTION, WE HAVE REWRITTEN THE POLITICAL MAP. THANK YOU FOR HONORING US WITH A WIN FOR THE AGES. 20221109202122.663|20221109202500.514",

        "trs": " WE SAW FREEDOM AND OUR VERY WAY OF LIFE AND SO MANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY WITHER ON THE VINE. FLORIDA HELD THE LINE. WE CHOSE FACTS OVER FEAR. WE CHOSE EDUCATION OVER INDOCTRINATION. WE WERE A REFUGE OF SANITY WHEN THE WORLD WENT MAD.  RON DESANTIS CELEBRATING HIS HISTORIC VICTORY BECOMING THE FIRST REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR TO WIN THE DEMOCRATIC STRONG HOLD OF MIAMI-DADE COUNTY IN 20 YEARS. FOUR YEARS AGO, DESANTIS LOST MIAMI-DADE BY 20 POINTS. THIS YEAR HE WON IT BY 11. GIVING HIM A JOLT OF MOMENTUM AND OBVIOUSLY FUELING A LOT OF TALK ABOUT A 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUN FOR HIM. KELLYANNE CONWAY AND DOUG SCHROEN ARE HERE. FIRST TO STEVE HARRIGAN JOINING US FROM TAMPA. HI, STEVE.  MARTHA, REALLY A DRAMATIC AND STARTLING RIGHT NOR RON DESANTIS THE PAST FOUR YEARS. FOUR YEARS AGO HE BARELY SQUEAKED BY AT LESS THAN 1%. NOW YOU TALK TO HIS SUPPORTERS, THEY ARE SURPRISED BY THIS MARGIN. DESANTIS SAYS THIS IS A WIN FOR THE AGES. HE ALSO SAID FLORIDA IS A STATE THAT HIGH SCHOOL BECOME A BASTION OF FREEDOM FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY.  WE REJECT WOKE IDEOLOGY. WE FIGHT THE WOKE IN THE LEGISLATURE. WE FIGHT THE WOKE IN THE SCHOOLS. WE FIGHT THE WOKE IN THE CORPORATIONS. WE WILL NEVER EVER SURRENDER TO THE WOKE MOB. FLORIDA IS WHERE WOKE GOES TO DIE.  BIG WINS, DRAMATIC WINS FOR REPUBLICAN AS CROSS THE STATE. SENATOR MARCO RUBIO EASILY WINNING RE-ELECTION BY 16 POINTS OVER REPRESENTATIVE VAL DEMINGS. IT MAKES A MOVE FROM A SWING STATE TO A RED STATE. ALSO SHAKING UP SOME TRADITIONAL COALITIONS. YOU MENTIONED THAT DESANTIS WAS ABLE TO WIN MIAMI-DADE COUNTY WITH ITS 70% HISPANIC POPULATION. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT NO REPUBLICAN HAS DONOR THE PAST 20 YEARS. OF COURSE, NOT A LOT OF TIME FOR DESANTIS TO SAVOR THE VICTORY. HE'S BACK IN TALLAHASSEE PREPPING FOR A POTENTIAL HURRICANE THAT MIGHT HIT FLORIDA OVERNIGHT. MARTHA, BACK TO YOU.  THANKS, STEVE. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. GOVERNOR DESANTIS ON THE CORR OF THE \"NEW YORK POST\" TODAY WITH THE HEADLINE DeFUTURE. YOUNG GOP STAR DESANTIS WALKED TO VICTORY IN FLORIDA. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT. LET'S BRING IN OUR PANEL, KELLYANNE CONWAY, FORMER COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP AND DOUG SCHROEN, FORMER ADVISER TO PRESIDENT CLINTON. WISE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN CAMPAIGNS AND POLLING FOR A LONG TIME. A TOP THOUGHT ON LAST NIGHT BEFORE WE DIG IN TO THIS DESANTIS ISSUE.  TOP LINE THOUGHT IS THE GOVERNOR DID VERY WELL INCLUDING UNFORTUNATELY SOME DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS. WE'LL HAVE A SWITCH IN NEVADA AND ARIZONA. I THINK THE OTHER TOP LINE ANALYSIS IS THIS. RE-ALIGNMENTS LIKE THIS ARE, THEY TAKE AWHILE TO BE DURABLE. SO THE FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS SHOWS SHIFTS TO THE GOP. PLUS EIGHT AMONG WOMEN, PLUS 15 AMONG BLACKS, A TEN-POINT SWING AMONG HISPANICS AND THE SUBURBAN WHITE WOMEN THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. THE ACTUAL SHIFTS WERE THERE. IT JUST DIDN'T READ DOWN TO THE BENEFIT OF EVERY INDIVIDUAL RACE. IN TERMS OF GOVERNOR DESANTIS, THERE'S NO QUESTION IT WAS A WIDE AND DEEP VICTORY. THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO HELPED. TRUMP LOST BY 30 IN 216. DESANTIS LOST I BY 24 TWO YEARS LATER. TWO YEARS TRUMP LOSES BY 7. TWO YEARS LATER, DESANTIS WINS I'M. THAT'S A SHIFT THAT I THINK WILL LAST. IT'S NOT ON ANY ONE ELECTION. PRESIDENT TRUMP GOT 5.6 MILLION VOTES IN FLORIDA. A MIDDLE MORE. JOB GOT 5.2 MILLION. TWO SHORT YEARS AGO. THIS IS HUGE AGAINST THE DEMOCRATS AS WELL.  THE QUESTION -- TWO QUESTIONS. THE QUESTION IS FLORIDA SORT OF ITS OWN UNIQUE THING OR DOES IT REFLECT THE COUNTRY? WE'RE TAUGHT TO LOOK AT ELECTIONS. YOU KNOW, OH, THIS HAPPENED IN FLORIDA SO HERE'S WHAT WE MIGHT SEE HAPPENING. YOU'RE RIGHT. THE SAME THING HAPPENED IN 2020. A BIG WIN FOR FLORIDA AND DIDN'T TRANSLATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. DOUG?  WE HEARD AN AFFIRMATIVE AND CLEAR AND I DARE SAY POSITIVE MESSAGE FOR GOVERNOR DESANTIS. I WOULD SAY KELLYANNE, I DON'T THINK THE REPUBLICANS DID AS GOOD A JOB NATIONALLY AS GOVERNOR DESANTIS DID ARTICULATE AGO RATIONALE. THE OTHER THING I SAW LAST NIGHT IS POLARIZATION IS STRONG. PUTS ANOTHER WAY, DEMOCRATS CAME OUT WITH TERRIBLE TERRIBLE NUMBERS WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED A MUCH BIGGER VICTORY AS KELLYANNE SUGGESTED. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN BECAUSE DEMOCRATS VOTED ON ISSUES LIKE ABORTION. THEY ALSO JUST VOTED PARTY IDENTIFICATION AND WERE MOBILIZED BY A PRESIDENT AND FORMER PRESIDENT AND IN THE CASE OF OBAMA AND CLINTON WHO GOT OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.  Martha: SO THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE FACT THAT THINGS COST SO MUCH MORE? THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT ENERGY INDEPENDENT? WERE THEY PAYING A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THE ISSUES? NOT --  THEY WERE PAYING ATTENTION, BUT THEY WERE NOT DOING WHAT VOTERS TYPICALLY DO, WHICH IS TO SWING AGAINST AN INCUMBENT PRESIDENT WHEN 75, 76% SAID THE COUNTRY IS HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION AND HIS OWN APPROVAL UNDER 50.  Martha: THAT'S WEIRD. USUALLY YOU SEE A PUNISHMENT FOR A 75% WRONG TRACK NUMBER.  I THINK WE HAVE. THE REPUBLICANS WILL TAKE THE HOUSE. NANCY PELOSI IS DONE AS SPEAKER. IT'S MORE THAN LIKELY THEY'LL HAVE A SLIM MAJORITY, A GOVERNING MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. KAMALA HARRIS WILL NO LONGER BE BREAKING THE TIE VOTES. THAT'S HOW WE GOT --  Martha: YOU SAY YOU THINK REPUBLICANS WILL WIN NEVADA IN THE SENATE?  YES.  AND ALSO WIN GEORGIA?  THEY HAVE TO WIN GEORGIA. WE HAVE TO HAVE EVERY NATIONAL STAR OUT THERE WHICH INCLUDES RON DESANTIS, KIM REYNOLDS AND GREG ABBOTT HELPING HERSCHEL WALKER. THE SENATE IS ON THE LINE. THE DEMOCRATS SAID DEMOCRACY IS ON THE BALLOT. YOU'RE DARN RIGHT IT IS IN THIS GEORGIA RUN-OFF. THEY TRIED TO DO EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO HERSCHEL WALKER AND HIS CANDIDACY. AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK WHO HAD ALL THE KINGS HORSES AND MEN AND ALL THE MONEY HE NEED AND WAS NOT ABLE TO CLEAR 50%. HE'S THE VULNERABLE ONE HERE. I THINK THE MOTIVATION IS STILL TO HAVE DIVIDED GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON. THE BIG LOSER LAST NIGHT IS JOE BIDEN IN THIS WAY. HE'S GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT NOW. THEY'RE GOING TO READ ALL THE WRONG TEA LEAVES HERE, MARTHA. THE PEOPLE THAT WANTED TO GET RID OF JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS AND MOVE ON AS THE LEFT LOVES TO SAY, THEY'RE STUCK WITH HIM NOW. HE WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN MORE LIKELY THAN NOT. HE WILL LOSE.  Martha: MARK PENCE SAID THE SAME THING.  IT IS TRUE TO THE DETRIMENT POTENTIALLY OF DEMOCRATS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THIS IS GOING TO BE A TOUGH RECORD TO DEFEND, MARTHA. I WOULD SAY I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH KELLYANNE THAT IT'S A BIG REPUBLICAN WIN OR INA REPUBLICAN WIN, BUT YOU WILL HAVE A REPUBLICAN HOUSE. THE SENATE WILL BE UP FOR GRABS. AND HOW THAT GOES WILL SAY A LOT --  A REPUBLICAN WIN IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, THAT'S A REPUBLICAN WIN. YOU AND MARK PENN HAVE BEEN URGING DEMOCRATS AND THE PRESIDENT TO PIVOT, TO CHANGE THEIR TONE, TO GET CLOSER TO THE MIDDLE.  RIGHT.  Martha: NOW AS A RESULT OF LAST NIGHT, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO YOU.  THEY WON'T.  Martha: THEY'LL SAY WE HAVE IT ALL RIGHT.  JOE BIDEN WILL RUN. IT'S ALSO THE CASE THAT MOST DEMOCRATS PRIVATELY DON'T WANT HIM TO RUN.  Martha: WHAT ABOUT THE TRUMP DESANTIS ISSUE? QUICK RESPONSE FROM BOTH OF YOU. DOUG?  BIG NIGHT FOR DESANTIS. TRUMP WILL GO TO KNOCK DESANTIS OUT QUICKLY AND STRONGLY AS HE STARTED DOING LAST NIGHT.  Martha: YOU EXPECT THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL STILL ANNOUNCE MID NOVEMBER, KELLYANNE?  THAT'S UP TO HIM. I THINK TRUMP CAN'T WAIT AND DESANTIS MUST AND CAN. HE JUST GOT RE-ELECTED. MY ADVICE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD BE TO DO WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING ALL A LONG. DON'T ANNOUNCE UNTIL AFTER THE MID-TERMS AND THE MID-TERMS ARE NOT OVER. WE HAVE TO GO TO THIS RUN-OFF. I'D WAIT --  Martha: YOU'D LIKE HIM TO NOT SAY ANYTHING --  I'D LIKE HIM TO FINISH WHAT HE AND OTHERS STARTED, GET HERSCHEL WALKER IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE SO WE HAVE A MAJORITY THERE. THE MID-TERMS ARE NOT OVER YET, MARTHA. LET'S LET THEM FINISH. DONALD TRUMP DESERVES CREDIT FOR HIS RESTRAINT IN NOT ANNOUNCING AND TRYING TO HELP CANDIDATES AS BEST HE COULD.  WE DEMOCRATS WOULD LIKE HIM TO ANNOUNCE NOVEMBER 15 AS HE SAID HE WOULD. THAT WOULD BE GREAT.  I WANTS HIM AND OTHER REPUBLICANS HELPING HERSCHEL WALKER WIN. SO WE'LL WAIT TILL THE MID-TERMS ARE OVER. THEY MAY NOT BE OVER THIS YEAR.  COME BACK SOON. THANK YOU.  Martha: GREAT COVERAGE LAST NIGHT. COMING UP, MIKE POMPEO WHO HAS ALSO BEEN A NAME FLOATED AS A POSSIBLE 2024 CONTENDER REACTS TO LAST NIGHT'S ELECTION THAT IS STILL SHAKING OUT, FOLKS. IT COULD GET REDDER OR BLUER. WE HAVE TO KEEP WATCHING THIS. THE STUNNING BLOW TO VLADIMIR PUTIN'S WAR MACHINE AS RUSSIAN RETREATS FROM A KEY CITY IN UKRAINE. 20221109203544.791|20221109203853.680",

        "trs": " Bill: BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA, DR. MEHMET OZ CALLING JOHN FETTERMAN EARLIER TODAY CONCEDING THE RACE. JEFF FLOCK IS IN THE STATE CAPITAL OF HARRISBURG. HOW GOES IT, JEFF?  GOOD MORNING. DANA MENTIONED THAT DEBATE THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN OZ AND FETTERMAN. WORTH NOTING BEFORE THAT DEBATE FETTERMAN HAD BEEN FAR AHEAD IN THE RACE. HE ENDED UP HOLDING ON TO WIN. PICTURES OF HIM LAST NIGHT GREETING HIS VOTERS IN HIS CHARACTERISTIC HOODIE AND JEANS TATTOOED ARMS HE WILL BE QUITE A FIGURE ON THE FLOOR OF THE U.S. SENATE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ARE ALLOWED TO WEAR A HOODIE ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE. THE CAMPAIGN WAS AS MUCH AS HOW JOHN FETTERMAN LOOKED AS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. HERE IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY LAST NIGHT.  FOR EVERY JOB EVER LOST AND EVERY FACTORY CLOSED AND EVERY PERSON THAT WORKS HARD BUT NEVER CAN GET AHEAD, I'M PROUD OF WHAT WE RAN ON. STANDING UP TO CORPORATE GREED. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MAKING MORE THINGS RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA AND RIGHT HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA.  SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THE GUBERNATORIAL RACE, THE ONE THAT HAD THE REPUBLICAN AGAINST SHAPIRO THE DEMOCRAT MAY HAVE DRAGGED DOWN THE OZ CAMPAIGN. THE REPUBLICAN WAS DRUBBED IN THE RACE AND TICKED OFF PEOPLE AND SAYING HOW HE COULD TAKE OVER VOTING MACHINES AND OPPOSED TO ABORTIONS WITH NO EXCEPTIONS IN ANY CASE. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS TALKING TO VOTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA. MAKE NO MISTAKE. THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR THEM IS STILL THE ECONOMY. EVEN PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE HOW JOE BIDEN HAS HANDLED THE ECONOMY, VOTED FOR FETTERMAN. IT CAME DOWN TO THE FACT WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY, A GUY IN A HOODIE AND BLUE JEANS WITH TATTOOS ON HIS ARMS HAS MORE OF A SYMPATHETIC FEEL THAN A GUY EDUCATED AT AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL WITH A LOT OF MONEY WHO MOVED INTO THE STATE JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO.  Bill: QUIT A STUNNER COMING OFF THAT DEBATE. NICE TO SEE YOU IN HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA.  Dana: JIM MASS ENA, YOU KNOW POLITICS AS WELL AS ANYBODY ELSE. GET YOUR OVERALL TAKE ABOUT THE ELECTION RESULTS. EVEN DEMOCRATS WERE THINKING THAT THE NIGHT WASN'T GOING TO GO THAT WELL FOR THEM AND THERE WERE BLIND QUOTES PRE-BLAMING THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND OTHERS AND IT TURNS OUT THEY DID PRETTY WELL.  LOTS OF DEMS ARE SAYING IT WAS MUCH BETTER THAN WE COULD HAVE EXPECTED. SURPRISING, ONCE AGAIN THE POLLS WERE WRONG FOR THE FOURTH CYCLE. THEY MISSED THIS WAVE OF DEMOCRATIC WOMEN VOTING. THE BIG WINNER WAS DEMOCRACY. WE HAD MASSIVE TURNOUT ALL OVER THE PLACE. VERY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT. THE OTHER THING IS PEOPLE CRITICIZED BIDEN FOR STEERING INTO THE DEMOCRACY ARGUMENT AND IT WORKED WITH HIS BASE. YOU LOOK AT THESE RACES AND THEY HAVE MASSIVE TURNOUT FROM BOTH PARTIES. YOU WOULD EXPECT IT FROM THE REPUBLICANS, NOT THE DEMOCRATS. WE'LL HAVE THE LARGEST MID-TERM ELECTION TURNOUT IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY.  Bill: PEOPLE ARE WAKING UP SAYING WHAT IN THE WORLD HAPPENED? OUR THOUGHTS ARE SPINNING BETWEEN OUR EARS RIGHT NOW. LET ME TRY AND DO THIS FOR YOU, OKAY? FLORIDA WAS A WIN FOR THE REPUBLICANS AGREED.  AGREE.  OHIO WAS A WIN FOR REPUBLICANS. GOVERNOR AND SENATE. A COUPLE HOUSE RACES WE CAN DEBATE. NEW YORK STATE WAS A WIN FOR REPUBLICANS WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE HOUSE RACES THAT WILL IN ALL LIKELIHOOD FLIP AT THE END OF THE DAY, AGREED ON THAT?  Dana:  --  THE GOVERNOR'S RACE NOTWITHSTANDING.  Bill: THE POINT IN THE UPPER MIDWEST NOT ONLY TO PENNSYLVANIA AND WE CAN SAY WAS A CLEAR WIN FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  FIRST TIME SINCE 1966 DEMOCRATS HELD THAT.  Bill: NOW I'M IN WISCONSIN. AS OF NOW THIS IS A WIN FOR REPUBLICANS BECAUSE RON JOHNSON IS HANGING ON. DANA, IF YOU REMEMBER WE WERE TALKING TO --  Dana: NOT THE GOVERNOR'S RACE, THOUGH.  Bill: EVERS WON THAT. WAS IT A MONTH AGO WHEN KEVIN MCCARTHY SAID WISCONSIN IS THE NEW OHIO? I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS HIS QUOTE. WISCONSIN WAS THAT CLOSE. NOW WE GO TO MICHIGAN. THIS WAS A RACE WHERE SEVERAL RACES IN THAT STATE. REPUBLICANS POURED A TON OF MONEY IN THERE AND THEY LOST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT SEVEN TO SLOTKIN AND THEY JUST LOST EIGHT TO KILDEE. THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD FLIP BOTH OF THEM.  THEY LOST THE HOUSE, SENATE AND SECURITY.  Bill: THERE WAS A STATE REFERENDUM ON ABORTION. IS THAT WHAT WE ARE LED TO BELIEVE IS THE DECIDER IN THESE?  ABSOLUTELY AND WHY YOU SAW THE BIG UNKNOWN WAVE OF DEMOCRATIC WOMEN VOTING. MICHIGAN UNBELIEVABLE HOUSE FLIPPED, STATE SENATE FLIPS. SIX MONTHS AGO YOU WOULD HAVE WRITTEN WHITMER OFF. SHE WINS HANDILY. FIVE STATES HAD ABORTION REFERENDUMS INCLUDING MONTANA. ALL OF THEM PASSED. ABORTION IS BECOMING THE ISSUE THAT'S DRIVING TURNOUT. LAST NIGHT EXIT POLLS YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT IT EARLIER. DEMOCRATS WIN INDEPENDENTS IN A NON-PRESIDENTIAL YEAR. NO POLL SAW THAT COMING BECAUSE THE WOMEN WENT CRAZY.  Bill: KENTUCKY YOU HAD A REFERENDUM TO MAKE IT ILLEGAL AND DEFEATED IN A RED STATE LIKE KENTUCKY.  Dana: DO YOU THINK IN 2024 YOU'LL SEE ANY STATE THAT DIDN'T HAVE A REFERENDUM PUT IT ON THE BALLOT TO HELP DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT.  IF I'M INVOLVED ABSOLUTELY. YOU HAVE TO NOW. IT'S STATE BY STATE AND GOOD POLITICS. THIRD IT IS PROOF THIS IS GOING TO BE THE DEFINING ISSUE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  Dana: HOW WOULD YOU FIX POLLING?  FIRE ALL OF THEM AND STOP DOING IT. STOP DOING IT. IT HAS BEEN WRONG OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  Dana: STOP PAYING ATTENTION TO IT?  STOP COVERING IT.  Bill: LOOK AT THE LIVE LOOK. RON DESANTIS IS ABOUT TO SPEAK BUT NOT ABOUT LAST NIGHT BUT THE TROPICAL STORM BLUING OFF THE EASTERN SHORES OF FLORIDA. THIS IS THE GUY TESTING THE LINE. JIM, THANK YOU. TO FLORIDA LIVE WE GO IN A MOMENT. FOX NEWS HASN'T YET CALLED THIS HOUSE RACE IN NEW YORK. NEW YORK 17. THE REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER MIKE LAWLOR SLIGHTLY AHEAD AS OF NOW. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY WILL HOLD A PRESS CONFERENCE IN 20 MINUTES. A HUGE LOSS FOR THE DEMOCRATS AND A BIG PICKUP FOR THE REPUBLICANS.

        "trs": " Bill: MOMENTS AGO FOX NEWS CONFIRMS THE SEAN PATRICK MALONEY THE HELPED OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE HAS JUST PHONED MIKE LAWLER THE REPUBLICAN OF NEW YORK 17TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT AND CONCEDED THAT RACE TO THE REPUBLICAN. MIKE LAWLER WILL BE OUR GUEST IN A MATTER OF MOMENTS.  Dana: INCREDIBLE OUTCOME. WENT AFTER THE KING AND GOT HIM. INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT KATHY HOCHUL OF NEW YORK HAS WON NEW YORK'S GOVERNOR'S RACE AGAINST CHALLENGER LEE ZELDIN. THE FIRST WOMAN ELECTED GOVERNOR OF THE EMPIRE STATE. THAT'S TRUE. ALEXIS MCADAMS HAS BEEN FOLLOWING ALL THESE NEW YORK RACES. GOOD MORNING, ALEXIS.  GOOD MORNING, DANA. A HISTORIC NIGHT FOR GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL. CONGRESSMAN LEE ZELDIN SAYS IT IS NOT OVER YET. THE LATEST NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW THIS MORNING. GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL WITH MORE THAN 52% OF THE VOTE AND LEE ZELDIN WITH 47%. 93% OF THE BALLOTS HAVE BEEN COUNTED. ALTHOUGH IT WAS A DEMOCRATIC VICTORY LAST NIGHT THE RACE WAS CLOSER THAN EXPECTED IN DEEP BLUE NEW YORK AND WHY IT WAS IN THE SPOTLIGHT IN THE FIRST PLACE. HOCHUL TOOK TO THE STAGE TO THANK SUPPORTERS FOCUSING ON MOVING FORWARD IN HER FIRST FULL TERM AS GOVERNOR.  I AM NOT HERE TO MAKE HISTORY. I AM HERE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]  AND BECAUSE OF ALL OF YOU, WE'LL KEEP MAKING PROGRESS BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS AND GLASS CEILINGS AND HELPING NEW YORKERS ACHIEVE THE GREATNESS IT IS CAPABLE OF.  BUT OVER AT THE ZELDIN WATCH PARTY IN NEW YORK CITY WHERE I WAS LAST NIGHT THE PARTY-LIKE ATMOSPHERE CONTINUED. HOCHUL WAS IN THE LEAD THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN WAS CLOSING THE GAP ON THE INCUMBENT FOR WEEKS HAMMERING HOME CRIME AND ECONOMY AS HIS TOP ISSUES. ZELDIN DID NOT CONCEDE SAYING HE WILL WAIT FOR ALL OF THE VOTES TO BE COUNTED.  SO WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IS THAT OVER THE COURSE OF THESE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS YOU ARE GOING TO SEE THE RACE CONTINUE TO GET CLOSER AND CLOSER AND CLOSER AND CLOSER. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THIS INCLUDES, BY THE WAY, ON LONG ISLAND YOU WILL SEE A MASSIVE VICTORY COMING OUT OF LONG ISLAND.  ZELDIN WILL WAIT FOR THOSE VOTES OUT ON LONG ISLAND AND SUFFOLK COUNTY. THEY HAD SOME TACTICAL DIFFICULTIES. THE CLOSE RACE HELPS OTHER CANDIDATES WHO WERE REPUBLICAN HERE IN NEW YORK.  Dana: THANK YOU.  Bill: CONTROL OF THE SENATE STILL UP FOR GRABS NOW EVEN AFTER DEMOCRATS FLIP THE SEAT IN PENNSYLVANIA. WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN GEORGIA? WISCONSIN? NEVADA? ARIZONA? MARTHA MACCALLUM HAS SOME ANSWERS.  Dana: YOU HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS, GO AHEAD.  ETCYES, I HAVE ALL THE ANSWE. THE WAY BACK MACHINE IN GEORGIA COMING BACK TO A QUESTION OF GEORGIA WILL PUT US BACK TO 2020. YOU KNOW, WE WERE TALKING IN THE BREAK. I WENT TO BED LAST NIGHT GOING WHAT HAPPENED? HOW DO YOU MAKE SENSE OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT THINGS? ACTUALLY OUR POLLING, FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS WAS PRETTY STRONG LAST NIGHT WHEN YOU GO BACK THROUGH IT AND LOOK AT WHAT THE INFORMATION THAT WE GOT FROM VOTERS AS THEY CAME OUT OF THE BOOTH AND PEOPLE WHO WERE VOTING PRIOR TO THAT. BUT I THINK THAT IT SOLIDIFIED THE FACT THE COUNTRY IS DUG IN IN MOST PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, RIGHT? WHERE ARE THE VARIABLES? THEY ARE IN GEORGIA, ARIZONA, RIGHT? YOU ARE RIGHT BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE IN THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. FLORIDA WAS SORT OF THIS KIND OF AMAZING ANOMALY TO WATCH LAST NIGHT. YOU HAVE TO WONDER, I LOOK AT NEW YORK AND LEE ZELDIN AND I SAID THIS LAST NIGHT DID ALL OF HIS VOTERS MOVE TO FLORIDA DURING COVID? AND THAT MAY HAVE PREVENTED HIM TO GET WHAT HE NEEDED IN THE NEW YORK CITY. BUT WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO DUG IN ON BOTH SIDES, YOU CAN'T MOVE THEM ALL AT ONCE. IT IS AN INCREMENTAL, SLOW PROCESS OF PEOPLE DECIDING TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS AND WE LIVE IN INCREDIBLY UNCERTAIN TIMES. CHANGE IS HARD. WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE VOTING BOOTH I AM STICKING WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT I HAVE. I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT CANDIDATE QUALITY THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A LOT LAST NIGHT. A MAJOR RE-EVALUATION. AND I THINK THE ISSUE OF ABORTION WAS THE SLEEPER ISSUE IN THIS RACE. I ALWAYS WONDERED AS WE FOLLOWED THIS HOW CAN IT BE POSSIBLE THAT AN ISSUE THAT HAS HAD MONEY POURED INTO IT FOR MY ENTIRE LIFETIME AND GROUPS WHO DEDICATED THEIR LIVES TO LOBBYING ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS ABORTION ISSUE, HOW COULD IT BE POSSIBLE THAT THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNS IT AND IT HAS BARELY AN EFFECT ON ELECTION, RIGHT? SO EITHER I THOUGHT ALL OF THOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WERE FOR NOTHING, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE OKAY WITH THE DECISION ULTIMATELY OR NOT AND THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND. I THINK THE VOTER TURNOUT EFFORT ON THAT PART WAS VERY DEEP UNDERGROUND THAT REALLY PERCOLATED LAST NIGHT. I ALSO THINK WHEN YOU SAW SOME OF THE SPLIT TICKET DECISIONS PEOPLE SAID I WILL KEEP THAT RIGHT AND WE SAW THE REFERENDUMS IN A NUMBER OF STATES AND SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN KENTUCKY. PEOPLE DID WANT A MORE STRICT VERSION OF THE KENTUCKY LAW. I THINK IT HAD A REAL IMPACT.  Dana: THE YOUTH VOTE WAS UP IN PLACES LIKE WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN IN PARTICULAR. JESSICA TARLOV SAID THEY HAD SAME-DAY REGISTRATION. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN HAD LINES AROUND THE BLOCKS TO BE PATIENT AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THEY VOTED ON. ZBLIE WAS ON A CALL THE OTHER DAY WITH A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST WE LEFT THAT ISSUE TO THE SIDE AND DECIDED NOT TO TALK ABOUT IT. IT WAS A MISTAKE. THEY NEEDED TO ARTICULATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SUPREME COURT DECISION AND HOW NOW EVERY STATE GETS TO DECIDE WHAT THEIR RULES ARE. WE SEE THEM UPHELD ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHEN THE OPPORTUNITIES STARTING IN KANSAS MONTHS AGO. AND THEY JUST CHOSE NOT TO TALK ABOUT IT AND DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT COULD MOVE THEIR VOTERS AND IT WAS PROBABLY A MISTAKE.  Bill: GREAT JOB LAST NIGHT. YOU AND BRET. I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'LL BE IN FOUR HOURS. YOU WILL KNOW.  WE'LL SEE YOU ON \"THE STORY.\"  Bill: RON DESANTIS IS TALKING ABOUT THE STORM. THAT'S DONE. WE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THERE.  TO BE CONTINUED.  Dana: CAMPAIGN CHAIR MALONEY HAS CALLED OUR NEXT GUEST AND CONCEDED THE RACE IN NEW YORK CONGRESSIONAL RACE 17. A FLIP FOR THE REPUBLICANS. REPUBLICAN MIKE LAWLER WILL JOIN US NEXT. 20221109155219.468|20221109155721.202",

        "trs": " Bill: BREAKING NEWS OUT OF PENNSYLVANIA NOW, FOX NEWS CAN CONFIRM THAT DR. MEHMET OZ JUST CALLED JOHN FETTERMAN AND CONCEDED THAT SENATE RACE IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE DEMOCRAT SPOKESM TELLING US HERE AT THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL. WE CALLED IT LATE LAST NIGHT. OZ CONCEDED A MOMENT AGO. PENNSYLVANIA THE KEYSTONE STATE GOES -- IT'S A PICKUP FOR THE DEMOCRATS AND THERE LIES THE DRAMA FOR THE FORECAST FOR WISCONSIN, GEORGIA, NEVADA AND ARIZONA AS WE WAIT ON THAT. BATTLEGROUND ARIZONA, MENTIONED THAT. WE'RE WATCHING TWO HOTLY CONTESTED RACES THERE. A SENATE RACE THERE, DEMOCRAT MARK KELLY IS INCUMBENT FIGHTING TO KEEP THAT SEAT. REPUBLICAN BLAKE MASTERS TRYING TO GAIN SOME TRACTION THERE. THE BATTLE FOR THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION BETWEEN KATIE HOBBS AND KARI LAKE, BOTH CONTESTS TOO CLOSE TO CALL. KELLY O'GRADY LIVE IN PHOENIX TO BRING US UP TO DATE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE. GOOD MORNING, KELLY.  GOOD MORNING, BILL. TOO CLOSE TO CALL IS RIGHT. ELECTION OFFICIALS ARE TELLING US THAT WE'RE LIKELY GOING TO BE WAITING UNTIL FRIDAY TO SEE 95 TO 99% REPORTED IN. THAT MEANS A LOT COULD CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. I WANT TO GIVE YOU CONTEXT ON HOW AND WHY THIS RACE IS EVOLVING. LET'S START WITH THE SENATE. 66% REPORTING. DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT MARK KELLY LEADING BY FIVE POINTS. HE WON HEAVILY IN EARLY VOTING BUT MASTERS IS CLOSING IT AS DAY OF VOTING DAY TRICKLES IN. THE SPREAD. KELLY STARTED 18 POINTS AHEAD. MASTERS HAS ALREADY MADE UP 13% OVERNIGHT AND WE'RE SEEING NEW PATCHES SKEW HEAVILY FOR THE GOP. 90,000 VOTES SEPARATING THE TWO. ON THE GOVERNORS SIDE A LOT TIGHTER. KARI LAKE JUST 12,000 VOTES SEPARATE THE TWO. HOBBS START EVIDENCE THE NIGHT 14% HIGHER AND NARROWED TO UNDER A POINT OVERNIGHT. THE BIG REASON IS LAKE HAS BEEN WINNING A LOT OF BATCHES BY 70 TO 80%. ONE OF THE BIG STORY LINES IS VOTING ISSUES. 27% OF COUNTY MACHINES WERE DOWN FOR A PERIOD YESTERDAY. ELECTION OFFICIALS TELL US THE SNAFU WAS WITH THE PRINTER. IT WAS FIXED BY 1:00 P.M.ENTER RNC LOSS A LAST-MINUTE SUIT TO KEEP THE POLLS OPEN THREE MORE HOURS. LAKE A ADDRESSED THE ISSUES.  WE HAVE INCOMPETENT PEOPLE RUNING THE SHOW IN ARIZONA. IF WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS FIGHT THROUGH WE WILL. IF IT TAKES HOURS OR DAYS, WE WILL.  THOSE VOTING SNAFUS MEAN A LOT OF MARICOPA COUNTY BALLOTS ARE OUTSTANDING IN SKEW REPUBLICAN AND MASTERS ENCOURAGED THEIR BASE TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. WE'RE HERE AT MARICOPA COUNTY THEY ARE TABULATING. 60% OF THE RESIDENTS ARE IN THIS COUNTY AND AN UPDATE HOW MANY BALLOTS ARE STILL REMAINING.  Bill: KELLY, THANKS. DON'T GO FAR, OKAY?  Dana: SHE WILL BE SEEN A LOT TODAY. FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR KATIE PAVLICH AND JESSICA TARLOV CO-HOST OF THE FIVE. JESSICA, EVEN DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THEY WOULD LOSE SEATS AND EVEN PRE-BLAMING JOE BIDEN WITH BLIND QUOTES IN MANY OF THE ARTICLES. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK MADE THE DIFFERENCE?  KNIVES WERE OUT FOR SURE. NOW THEY ARE BUTTER KNIVES, I THINK. THERE WILL STILL BE AN OVERWHELMING FEELING AND SOMETHING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT LAST NIGHT ON AIR UNTIL THE WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING. GREAT JOB, BILL WITH THE BOARD. DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. THIS WAS A PASS THAT WE DIDN'T NECESSARILY DESERVE IN TERMS OF HOW THE CAMPAIGN WAS RUN, RIGHT? WE WERE NOT ON MESSAGE. WE WERE NOT ON THE MESSAGE THAT THE EXIT POLLS SHOWED THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WANTED. I THINK MARC THIESSEN IS RIGHT AND A LOT MORE MEANINGFUL COMING FROM A CONSERVATIVE WHEN THEY SAY IT. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY JUST DID NOT GIVE PEOPLE A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO DEMOCRATS IN THE RACE. A LOT OF IT WAS CANDIDATE CHOICE. A LOT WAS POLICY. POLICY THAT AMERICANS THOUGHT WAS TOO EXTREME OR MISSING POLICY ESPECIALLY ON THE INFLATION FRONT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE COMMITMENT TO AMERICA, WHICH IS THE PLAN THE NEW CONTRACT FOR AMERICA THAT IS VERY SHORT AND VERY LIGHT ON DETAILS. I THINK PEOPLE TOOK IT TO HEART AND SAID INFLATION IS A PROBLEM. WE'RE ALL FEELING IT. THE SOLUTION IS TAX CUTS? THAT'S NOT SOMETHING HISTORICALLY THAT WILL HELP WITH INFLATION ANYWAY. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BETTER SOLUTION FOR PEOPLE THAN THAT. THOSE WERE MY BIG TAKEAWAYS.  WELL, CONSERVATIVE ACTIVISTS THIS MORNING ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE RESULTS LAST NIGHT AND BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT KEVIN MCCARTHY. I TALKED TO HIM YESTERDAY. THE LEADER. HE WAS VERY CONFIDENT THAT THINGS WOULD GO WELL NOT JUST IN RED STATES BUT ALSO IN DEEP BLUE DISTRICTS IN VIRGINIA, EVEN IN PLACES LIKE WASHINGTON AND OREGON. THERE ARE BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE LEADERSHIP GOT AHEAD OF THEMSELVES WHEN IT CAME TO WINNING THIS. THE FACT WE'RE SITTING HERE THIS MORNING WITH ALL OF THE ECONOMIC FACTORS WITH INFLATION AND JOE BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATING SITTING IN THE LOW 40s WITHOUT A FULL RESULT ON WHETHER REPUBLICANS HAVE EVEN TAKEN THE HOUSE BACK AT THIS POINT. IT SAYS A LOT.  Dana: SENATOR FROM FLORIDA AND HIS LEADERSHIP SAME?  RICK SCOTT WAS ON VACATION IN ITALY WHILE THE RNC WAS RUNNING OUT OF MONDAY. QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HIS PRIORITIES WERE GOING INTO SEPTEMBER RIGHT AHEAD OF PEOPLE STARTING TO PAY ATTENTION. HOWEVER, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS AND WHERE WE'LL END UP, REPUBLICANS IF THEY DO END UP WITH EVEN A SLIM MAJORITY, 1 OR 2 SEATS. THAT'S GOOD LUCK IN WASHINGTON. VOTERS WOULD SEND THE MESSAGE WE WOULD LIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO LESS. WE WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO HAVE DEBATES AND STOP PASSING THROUGH THESE MASSIVE PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT CAUSE INFLATION THAT ARE PASSED BY DEMOCRATS THAT ARE PASSED BY THE VICE PRESIDENT COMING IN AND BREAKING TIES.  Bill: GRIDLOCK WOULD BE GOOD?  IT'S NOT A BAD THING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WAY THE GOVERNOR'S RACES WENT. REPUBLICANS ARE DOMINATING STATE LEGISLATURES AND GOVERNOR'S RACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. INTERESTING TO WATCH FLORIDA AND IN NEW YORK, STEFANIK ALL OF HER WORK TO GET GOOD CANDIDATES IN THE NEW YORK RACES PAID OFF FOR HER.  Bill: WHAT I FIND OUT IN THE ELECTIONS WE REVERT TO OUR HOME STATES. YOU ARE FROM ARIZONA, YOU ARE FROM NEW YORK, AM I RIGHT? 30 SECONDS WHAT DO YOU SEE IN NEW YORK?  I SEE THAT PEOPLE IN NEW YORK ARE ACTUALLY DEMOCRATS AND HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT ALL ALONG. IT TAKES A LOT TO PERSUADE A NEW YORKER.  Bill: FOUR HOUSE SEATS THAT COULD FLIP REPUBLICAN.  WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH HOCHUL SHE WOULD WIN HER RACE BUT PULL THE PEOPLE BELOW HER DOWN. A BIG DEAL IF MALONEY LOSES. IT IS VERY -- THE MAGA BRANDING HAVING THE TRUMP ENDORSEMENT AND HAVING SUCH AN EXTREME PERSONAL POSITION ON ABORTION HE ACCEPTED THE FACT WE HAVE OUR LAWS HERE AND WE WILL BE PROTECTED IT'S A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE, MODERATE REPUBLICAN WOMEN WHO FEEL AS THOUGH THEY WOKE UP LESS FREE THE DAY AFTER THE DOBBS DECISION NO MATTER WHAT STATE THEY LIVE IN. WOMEN -- ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH PREGNANCIES AND BECOME PART OF THIS COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE AND THE TRAUMA IF YOU LOSE THE PREGNANCY. WHEN YOU TALK TO WOMEN IN LIBERAL STATES WHO DON'T HAVE NIGHING RE ANYTHING TO PERSONALLY WORRY ABOUT THEY ARE LOOKING AT WOMEN IN PENNSYLVANIA.  THE BIGGEST THING IN ARIZONA 25% OF THE VOTING MACHINES, THE BIGGEST COUNTY IN THE STATE, WERE NOT WORKING. WAS ABSOLUTELY AS NINE AND RIDICULOUS. THAT ALONE GIVEN THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE IN 2020, THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ELECTIONS. IF YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THE RESULTS, THEN YOU BETTER MAKE SURE THE ELECTION RUN SMOOTHLY AND ARIZONIANS DESERVE BETTER THAN WHAT HAPPENED.  Bill: BORDER AGENTS WORKING TO STOP SMUGGLING ATTEMPTS. MASSIVE AMOUNT OF DRUGS COMING ACROSS THE BORDER. J.D. VANCE IS A WINNER IN THE BUCKEYE STATE. HOW DID HE DO IT? WE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE GO LIVE THERE NEXT. where. 20221109145457.943|20221109145922.406",

        "trs": "\u266a \u266a\u266a \u266a  Steve: FROM WINNERS AND LOSERS TO RACES LEFT TO BE DECIDED, A LOT STILL CLOSE TO CALL, HERE WITH OUR BIGGEST TAKE A WAYS FROM LAST NIGHT'S BIGGEST RACES LEE CARTER AUTHOR OF PERSUASION. GOOD MORNING TO YOU.  GOOD MORNING.  Steve: FIRST OF ALL WHERE'S THE RED WAVE.  YOU KNOW, THERE WAS ONE THING I WAS CALLING, I EXPECTED IT TO BE MORE OF A RED SURGE THAN A RED WAVE OR RED TSUNAMI. SO I THINK THE POLLS WERE RIGHT IN THE SENATE THEY'RE REALLY HOLDING STRONG IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACES AS WELL. I THINK THEY WERE A LITTLE BIT OFF IN THE HOUSE. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE REPUBLICANS I THINK UNDERESTIMATED HOW IMPORTANT ABORTION WAS TO THE ELECTION. 27% OF VOTERS WENT OUT THERE AND SAID THAT THAT WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT DECIDING FACTORS AND THERE WAS SOME OTHER LESSONS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AS WELL.  Steve: I WAS READING SOME OF THE OTHER NETWORKS EXIT POLLING. THEY SAID THAT ABORTION AND DEMOCRACY WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE POLITICAL RIGHT WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT, THOSE WERE ACTUALLY THE BIG ISSUES WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE VOTERS.  SO WHAT WAS FASCINATING LAST NIGHT WE HAD A GROUP OF VOTERS HERE IN STUDIO WHO WE WERE TALKING TO, AND WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY BEING AT STEAK IT JUST WASN'T WHAT I THINK EVERYBODY UNDERSTOOD IT TO BE. THEY WEREN'T AFRAID THAT THEIR VOTES WEREN'T GOING TO BE COUNTED AS MUCH AS THEY WERE AFRAID THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING TO STAND UP FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT. THERE WERE A LOT OF CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT THAT THEY SAID WERE ELECTION DENIERS AND THEY REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THAT. THEY WANTED LEADERSHIP THAT WAS GOING TO TAKE A HARDER STAND ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES.  Steve: HOW ABOUT, AND WE JUST BUMPED IN WITH THE RACE BOARDS ON GEORGIA, BRIAN KEMP RAN AWAY WITH THE GOVERNORSHIP ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, BUT HERSCHEL WALKER AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THERE IS STILL TRAILING BY.9 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT YOU WOULD SEE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF TICKET SPLITTING GOING ON THERE.  THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT OF TICKET EXPLOITING SAME THING IN PENNSYLVANIA WHERE YOU SAW A HUGE MARGIN FOR SHAPIRO AND FETTERMAN IS JUST INCHING AWAY. SO THERE WAS A LOT OF TICKET SPLITTING A LOT OF VERY THOUGHTFUL VOTERS AND I THINK THAT WHAT WE ARE A SEEING IS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE SAYING I DON'T LOVE EITHER THE DEMOCRATS OR THE REPUBLICANS, AND SO I'M GOING TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR ME A STATE BY STATE ISSUE BY ISSUE BASIS.  Steve: RIGHT. SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TWO PARTIES, THEY BOTH HAD THEIR TALKING POINTS. THE REPUBLICANS TALKED ABOUT INFLATION, THE BORDER, CRIME AND STUFF LIKE THAT. THE DEMOCRATS WERE TALKING A LOT ABOUT ABORTION AND DEMOCRACY AND CLIMATE CHANGE. AND WHILE YOU'VE GOT BOTH SIDES POLAR OPPOSITE IT'S THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE.  THAT'S RIGHT.  Steve: ESSENTIALLY DO A LITTLE CAFETERIA THING. I LIKE SOMETHING FROM OVER HERE BUT I LIKE SOMETHING FROM OVER THERE.  EXACTLY RIGHT. THE THING I THOUGHT WAS FASCINATING TOO WHEN TALKING TO VOTERS LAST NIGHT AND ACROSS TIME, NOT EVERYBODY THINKS THAT INFLATION IS WITHIN OUR CONTROL. ABOUT HALF THE VOTERS THAT WERE IN THE STUDIO LAST NIGHT THOUGHT THAT INFLATION WAS A GLOBAL ISSUE THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY GOING TO BE CHANGED BY CHANGE OF POWER IN CONGRESS. AND SO I THINK THE REPUBLICANS REALLY FAILED TO MAKE THE CASE THAT IF THEY WERE GOING TO WIN, THAT THEY WERE GOING TO CHANGE INFLATION IN MEANINGFUL WAYS. AND THE PIVOT WENT ABOUT A MONTH AGO FROM THE INFLATION MESSAGE BEING LOOK HOW BAD IT IS TO THE COMMITMENT TO AMERICA AND HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT.  Steve: I THINK THE TWO BIG WINNERS LAST NIGHT OBVIOUSLY RON DeSANTIS.  OH, YEAH.  Steve: BUT ALSO JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN WON ONLY BECAUSE HE WASN'T THE BIGGEST LOSER. WE WERE GOING TO, THIS MORNING, HAD THERE BEEN A BIG RED WAVE EVERYBODY WOULD BE GOING BLAME JOE BIDEN. CAN'T SAY THAT NOW.  YOU CAN'T SAY THAT RIGHT NOW, NO. I THINK THE DEMOCRATS NEED TO HAVE SOME VERY SERIOUS LESSONS THEY LEARNED AS WELL AND ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE ELECTION PERIOD WAS THAT A LOT OF VOTERS FELT LIKE THEY WERE BEING CONDESCENDED AND LOOKED DOWN TO BY DEMOCRATS SO DEMOCRATS CAN LOOK AT THIS AS A VICTORY BY HOLDING THEIR OWN BUT THERE WAS A LOT OF MONEY TO JUST STANDSTILL.  Steve: WHAT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. HE ENDORSED I THINK HUNDREDS OF CANDIDATES.  YEAH, I DO THINK THAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS AHEAD OF US NOT BEHIND US. I THINK IT'S TIME, WHEN YOU LOOK AT CANDIDATES LIKE KEMP IN GEORGIA, YOU LOOK AT DeSANTIS IN FLORIDA, YOU LOOK AT THESE CANDIDATES WHO STAND FOR FREEDOM WHO STAND FOR BUSINESS, CANDIDATES OF ACTION, THAT'S WHERE THE MOMENTUM IS IT'S NOT COMING FROM DONALD TRUMP IN THE PAST IT'S COMING FROM THE FUTURE.  Steve: LEE CARTER UP LATE LAST NIGHT AND EARLY TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU.  Steve: WE'RE GOING TO STEP ASIDE.

        "trs": "\u266a \u266a  IF YOUR ALARM IS JUST GOING OFF, YOUR ELECTIONS, WE DON'T HAVE THE RESULTS YET. A BIG ELECTION NIGHT CONTINUING TO UNFOLD THIS MORNING AS WE ARE AWAITING RESULTS IN SEVERAL KEY RACES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY.  Steve: YEAH, USUALLY WE ARE THE POST GAME SHOW WE CAN TELL YOU WHO WON. WE DON'T KNOW YET.  IT IS STILL A NAIL-BITER. THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE SENATE IS UP IN THE AIR AS DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ARE TIED AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THERE 48 EACH. YOU NEED 51 FOR A MAJORITY FOR THE REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS JUST NEED 50. BECAUSE THEY GOT THE VICE PRESIDENT.  Brian: LISTEN TO THIS. THIS IS S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON AND UNFOLDING THROUGHOUT OUR SHOW. FOUR KEY SENATE RACES STILL NOT CALLED. GEORGIA LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE HEADING TO A RUNOFF. NO ONE IS GETTING 50. WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE YET. ABOUT 95% ARE IN. NEVADA, LOOKS LIKE LAXALT SURGED SINCE WE GOT UP THIS MORNING. HE NOW HAS A LEAD THERE BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS COUNTED. ARIZONA STRUGGLING TO COME UP WITH THEIR TALLIES. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE MASTERS IS STILL FAR BEHIND, AND WISCONSIN RON JOHNSON HAS NOT TRAILED BUT HE HAS JUST GOT HALF A POINT LEAD. WE ARE CLOSELY MONITORING ALL THOSE RACES AND RON JOHNSON SAID HE IS DEPRESSED THAT IT'S EVEN CLOSE EVEN THOUGH HE EXPECTS TO WIN.  Ainsley: HOUSE IS ALSO STILL FOR GRABS 218 SEATS NEEDED FOR CONTROL. YOU CAN SEE REPUBLICANS ARE INCHING CLOSER TO THE MAJORITY.  Steve: MANY TIGHT RACES ENDING WITH SOME MAJOR UPSETS AND SOME CRUCIAL WINS FOR BOTH PARTIES.  Brian: RIGHT, AND WE ARE WATCHING THESE RACE BOARDS MOVE WHILE WE ARE SPEAKING. SO LET'S GO TO KEVIN CORKE WHO IS IN WASHINGTON AND RECAPPING IT ALL. HEY, KEVIN.  GOOD MORNING, GUYS, YOU ARE RIGHT. WE CONTINUE TO AWAIT SEVERAL PIVOTAL RACES TO WRAP UP ESPECIALLY THOSE OUT WEST. BUT AS WE KEEP AN EYE ON THAT, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SENATE RACES FROM ARIZONA TO GEORGIA TO NEVADA TO WISCONSIN AS YOU POINTED OUT, OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S GOING TO DETERMINE THE BALANCE OF POWER IN WASHINGTON. AND THAT IS, OF COURSE, DESPITE A FACT THAT WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN A RESULTS COME ACROSS AND STILL WE DON'T KNOW WHICH PARTY WILL LEAD THE GOVERNMENT GOING FORWARD. WE DO KNOW IN PENNSYLVANIA THERE WAS NO RED WAVE TO SPEAK OF AS JOHN FETTERMAN, THE MAN WHO STRUGGLED TO SPEAK THROUGHOUT HIS LONE DEBATE STILL SOMEHOW MANAGED TO RIDE THE WAVE OF A MASSIVE LEAD THANKS TO EARLY BALLOTING AND MAIL-IN VOTING TO BEAT DR. OZ.  WE JAMMED THEM UP. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE HELD THE LINE. I NEVER EXPECTED THAT WE WERE GOING TO TURN THESE RED COUNTIES BLUE, BUT WE DID WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO. THAT'S WHY I'LL BE THE NEXT U.S. SENATOR FROM PENNSYLVANIA. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]  WOW. CANNOT WAIT TO DO THE AUTOPSY ON THAT RACE AND FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW THAT ALL WENT DOWN IN PENNSYLVANIA. MEANTIME, OVER IN OHIO, J.D. VANCE, AS YOU KNOW, PULLED OFF THE VICTORY OVER TIM RYAN CLAIMING A MUCH HERALDED SENATE SEAT IN THE BUCKEYE STATE.  WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR ME OR NOT, THE THING THAT I PROMISE TO DO IS GO TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND FIGHT EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR THE PEOPLE OF OHIO. THANKS FOR YOU, GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO JUST THAT. I WILL NEVER FORGET THE GREAT PEOPLE OF OHIO. THANK YOU FOR THIS HONOR TO SERVE YOU. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU EVERY DAY. GOD BLESS YOU GUYS AND THANK YOU. OH-IO. MEANTIME BARRING ANY MAJOR SURPRISES ON THE HOUSE SIDE KEVIN McCARTHY AND G.O.P. DO SEEM POISED TO USHER NANCY PELOSI RIGHT OUT OF THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE.  WHEN YOU WAKE UP TOMORROW, WE WILL BE IN THE MAJORITY AND NANCY PELOSI WILL BE IN THE MINORITY. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE READY FOR A MAJORITY THAT WILL OFFER A NEW DIRECTION. THAT WILL WILL PUT AMERICA BACK ON TRACK. REPUBLICANS ARE YESTERDAYY TO DELIVER IT. KEVIN McCARTHY SPEAKING THERE MEANTIME DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY LOST A NUMBER OF HIGH PROFILE GUBERNATORIAL RACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BRIAN KEMP, FOR EXAMPLE, KNOCKING OUT STACEY ABRAMS IN GEORGIA AGAIN. BETO O'ROURKE LOSING YET ANOTHER BID FOR POLITICAL OFFICE IN THE GREAT STATE OF TEXAS FALLING TO GREG ABBOTT ASES HE REMAINS IN THE STATE HOUSE IN BEAUTIFUL AUSTIN, TEXAS. THE NEWS WASN'T ALL BAD FOR THE DEMOCRATS LAST NIGHT. KATHY HOCHUL AND GRETCHEN WHITMER BOTH EDGED OUT THEIR REPUBLICAN OPPONENTS DESPITE MUCH TIGHTER THAN EXPECTED RACES IN BOTH CASES. WHILE DOWN IN THE SUNSHINE STATE, RON DESANTIS WON BIG, I MEAN REALLY BIG, LOOK AT THE VOTE TOTAL THERE BY A MILLION AND A HALF VOTES OVER CHARLIE CRIST. SO MUCH SO WAS THE IMPRESSIVE VICTORY THERE AT THE \"NEW YORK POST\" IS CALLING HIM DEFUTURE WHICH I THOUGHT WAS PRETTY CLEVER GUYS, BACK TO YOU.  Ainsley: WE HAVE A PICTURE OF HIS WHOLE FAMILY DEFUTURE.  Brian: THREE LITTLE KIDS CAME RUNNING OUT WIFE BESIDE HIM.  Ainsley: CANCER SURVIVOR.  Steve: THANK YOU DEKEVIN.  Brian: SO THAT'S WHERE FLORIDA IS. OBVIOUSLY A POSITIVE POINT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WE WERE JUST TALKING IN THE BREAK. HOW THE POLLSTERS GOT IT WRONG, TIFFANY SMILEY CLOSER. BOLDUC WITHIN ONE POINT THAT WASN'T INDEED THE CASE. J.D. VANCE, WOW, THE REPUBLICANS WERE SO NERVOUS ONLY 1 OR 2 POINTS. TIM RYAN WHAT A GREAT CANDIDATE.  Ainsley: WE THOUGHT TUDOR WAS CLOSER TO GRETCHEN WHITMER.  Brian: AND KARI LAKE IS TRAILING BY A POINT IN ARIZONA.  Ainsley: WE THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE A CLOT CLOSER WHEN THEY WERE. IT WAS A SHOCKER WHEN WE ALL LEARNED THAT BECAUSE THEY ARE SUCH BLUE STATES BUT WE DIDN'T EXPECT THE REPUBLICANS TO TRAIL BY AS MUCH AS THEY DID.  Steve: RIGHT, HISTORIC LIVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SHOULD HAVE PICKED UP A WHOLE BUNCH OF HOUSE SEATS AND THEY MAY STILL BECAUSE THE BALANCE OF POWER IS HANGING IN THE BALANCE REGARDING THAT IT'S STILL TOO CLOSE TO CALL.  Ainsley: 71 SEATS STILL AT PLAY AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR SHOW.  Steve: ALL THE POLLS AND THE POLLS GOT THEM WRONG FOR THE MOST PART. IN THE POLLS, IN THE RUN UP TO THE ELECTION, THE PRIMARY PHOTOGRAPH CAN YOU SAY WAS INFLATION, THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAID. BUT, THE NATIONAL EXIT POLLS, RUN BY NBC YESTERDAY WHERE PEOPLE CAME OUT IN THE POLLS AND SAID OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK? ABORTION AND DEMOCRACY WERE THE TWO OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES WITH VOTERS. WHEN IT COMES TO THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, WHY DID DR. OZ LOSE? WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE, ACCORDING TO THE EXIT POLLS, IT'S BECAUSE FETTERMAN WON. FETTERMAN GOT 57% OF THE INDEPENDENTS, FETTERMAN GOT 67% OF THE HISPANICS, HE GOT 57% OF THE WOMEN. AND, REMEMBER, IT WAS JUST LAST WEEK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" STORY THAT SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A 27-POINT SWING FROM SUBURBAN WOMEN FROM REPUBLICAN -- OR FROM DEMOCRATS TO REPUBLICANS. HE, FETTERMAN, WON 57% OF THE WOMEN. AND IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE, BY FAR, WAS ABORTION, WITH 35% FOLLOWED BY INFLATION AT 29% AND CRIME WAS 11%. AND THAT IS WHAT DROVE PEOPLE TO THE POLLS. THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EXIT POLLING REGARDING HERSCHEL WALKER, IN GEORGIA, HERSCHEL WALKER GOT ONLY 8% OF THE BLACK VOTER. GOT 42% OF THE INDEPENDENTS, AND 39% OF HISPANICS. SO HE DID NOT WIND UP WITH ANY MAJORITY IN THOSE.  Ainsley: WHEN YOU LOOK AT NEW YORK ZELDIN DIDN'T WIN. HE HASN'T COME OUT AND SAID THAT COVID-19 HOCHUL.  Steve: HE HASN'T CONCEDED.  Ainsley: LOOKS LIKE HE IS NOT GOING TO WIN. THE REPUBLICAN REFUGEES HAVE FLOCKED TO FLORIDA. HAVE GONE TO TENNESSEE. HAVE GONE TO TEXAS. TO THESE STATES WHERE YOU CAN BE A REPUBLICAN AND YOU'RE CHEERED, CONSERVATISM JUST WORKS DOWN IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. LOOK AT DESANTIS. FLORIDA DOES NOT HAVE A SINGLE DEMOCRATIC HOLDING STATEWIDE. MARCO RUBIO SWEPT THAT AREA. HE IS THE FIRST REPUBLICAN IN FLORIDA TO WIN A THIRD 6-YEAR TERM AS A SENATOR. HE WAS OUTRAISED AND OUTSPENT BY VAL DEMINGS AND STILL DID WELL. REPUBLICANS HAVE FLOCKED TO FLORIDA. IT HAS NOW TURNED TO A RED STATE. YOU REMEMBER WHEN GEORGE W. BUSH WAS RUNNING AND HE ONLY WON THE PRESIDENCY BY 500 VOTES.  Steve: WENT TO THE 1340UR9.  Ainsley: EXACTLY. IT HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN FLORIDA.  Brian: I WOULD ADD THIS:  THE HOUSE MAY GO TO REPUBLICANS, LIKELY TO GO. BECAUSE OF NEW YORK. THEY FLIPPED ABOUT FIVE OR SIX, IT LOOKS LIKE, MAJOR SEATS INCLUDING TAKING OUT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE. SO NEW YORK IS FED UP THEY MAYBE HAD THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A LEGITIMATE CONTENDER AS A GOVERNOR. NOTHING AGAINST ROB MASS STYRENE NO BUT HE NEVER GOT THE SUPPORT 3 TO 1 GOT 47% OF THE VOTE THAT HELPED EVERYONE DOWN TICKET. ABOUT A HALF HOUR AGO. MAYOR OF MIAMI JOINED US HELPED FUEL THE REPUBLICAN OF FLORIDA. HERE IS WHAT HE SAID.  LOOK AT THE TREND OF WHAT HAPPENED, 2016 DONALD TRUMP LOST MIAMI-DADE COUNTY BY 30 POINTS TO HILLARY. IN 2020, THAT 30-POINT MARGIN WAS JUST AN 8 POINT MARGIN IN FAVOR OF BIDEN. AND NOW NOW SEEING MIAMI-DADE GO COMPLETELY RED. AND THE GOVERNOR. YOU WIN MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, YOU HAVE A GREAT CHANCE OF WINNING FLORIDA BY A HUGE MARGIN AND SEE THAT ALSO LAST NIGHT. A 20-POINT MARGIN IN FLORIDA HEARD OF I THINK IT SETS A TEMPLATE HOW WE CAN WIN NATIONALLY. STEVE: THE THING ABOUT MIAMI-DADE COUNTY IS JOE BIDEN WON IT BY 85,000 POINTS SO FOR RON DESANTIS WIN BY DOUBLE DIGNITY THAT SAYS SOMETHING. WE SAW KEVIN McCARTHY SOUNDBITES FROM KEVIN CORKE. AS IT TURNS OUT, HE WAS GOING TO TAKE THE STAGE IN THE D.C. HOTEL LAST NIGHT AT 10:00. WOUND UP EVENTUALLY SPEAKING, I THINK AT 1:00 OR 2:00 IN THE MORNING. AND PREDICTED THE REPUBLICANS WOULD WIN THE HOUSE. JACQUI HEINRICH FROM OUR WHITE HOUSE UNIT SAID THAT A REPUBLICAN SOURCE TOLD HER THAT THE KNIVES ARE OUT FOR KEVIN McCARTHY. IF HE IS UNDER 225 HOUSE SEATS IN THE REPUBLICAN COLUMN, EXPECT SCALISE TO MAKE A MOVE QUICKLY FOR SPEAKER.  Brian: WHICH IS UNBELIEVABLE BECAUSE HE HAS RAISED SO MUCH MONEY FOR SOME CANDIDATES AND McCARTHY BROUGHT THE REPUBLICANS TO WITHIN FIVE SEATS IN 2020 OF THE HOUSE WHEN NO ONE GAVE HIM THAT SHOT. I HAVE WOULD BE SHOCKED IF THERE WAS A LEGITIMATE RUN AT HIS POWER.  Ainsley: I WOULD, TOO. McCARTHY IS PREDICTING THAT NANCY PELOSI WILL FIND HERSELF IN THE MINORITY THIS MORNING AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL FIND OUT QUICKLY.  Brian: MAYBE WITHIN OUR SHOW. WE WILL GO OVER TO CARLEY SHIMKUS. WE WILL FIND OUT WHAT SHE IS DOING WITH THE NEWS.  Carley: START HERE WITH AMERICA'S CRIME CRISIS. POLICE IN GEORGIA SEARCHING FOR TWO SUSPECTS IN A DEADLY SHOOTING FOLLOWING AN HOURS LONG SWAT STANDOFF. A 25-YEAR-OLD MAN WAS SHOT AND KILLED IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA. AND AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THE SUSPECTS BARRICADED THEMSELVES IN AN APARTMENT COMPLEX NEARBY. BUT THERE WAS NO SIGN OF THEM HEAVILY ARMED OFFICERS BREACHED THE BUILDING. TO SAY A FOX NEWS ALERT NOW. THOUSANDS OF FLORIDA RESIDENTS TOLD TO EVACUATE AS TROPICAL STORM NICOLE APPROACHES THE STATE'S EAST COAST. RESIDENCE ARE FILLING SANDBAGS TO PREPARE FOR THE STORM WHICH HAS TOP WIND SPEEDS OF 70 MILES PER HOUR. MANY PEOPLE ARE LINING UP AT GAS STATIONS AND PANIC BUYING FOOD AND WATER LEAVING SOME STORE SHELVES ALREADY EMPTY. YOU CAN FOLLOW THIS DEVELOPING STORY BY DOWN LOADING THE FOX WEATHER APP. FOR THE LATEST ON THE STORM. THE MAN ACCUSED OF THROWING A HARD SELTZER CAN AT TEXAS SENATOR TED CRUZ IS NOW CHARGED WITH AGGRAVATED ASSAULT. PROSECUTORS REVEAL HE BLURTED OUT I'M AN IDIOT AS OFFICERS TOOK HIM INTO CUSTODY. CRUZ WAS TARGETED WHILE CELEBRATING WITH A HOUSTON ASTROS AT THE THEIR WORLD SERIES VICTORY PARADE. THIS SHOWS A WHITE CLAW SKIMMING HIS FACE. LUCKILY, HE WAS NOT HURT. AND TIGER WOODS WILL BE BACK ON THE GOLF COURSE NEXT MONTH. WOODS WILL TEAM UP WITH RORY McKEL ROY TO TAKE ON JUSTICE THOMAS AND JORDAN SPIETH IN THE MATCH ON DECEMBER 10TH. WOODS HASN'T COMPETED SINCE MISSING THE CUT AT THE OPEN CHAMPIONSHIP IN JULY. THE 12-HOLE MADE FOR TV MATCH ALSO RAISING MONEY FOR HURRICANE IAN RELIEF EFFORTS. SO A GREAT CAUSE THERE, GUYS.  Steve: A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WATCH THAT THAT WILL BE GREAT.  Ainsley: I WILL BE PULLING FOR HIM. THANK YOU SO MUCH.  Brian: HISTORY MADE. SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS BECOMES THE FIRST FEMALE ELECTED GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS FOLLOWING IN HER FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS.  Steve: THE FORMER GOVERNOR AND VERY PROUD FATHER -- THERE IS HE BEAMING, MIKE HUCKABEE IS GOING TO JOIN US NEXT TO TALK ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER'S BIG WIN LAST NIGHT.

WHAT IS WITH ARIZONA? KELLY O'GRADY JOINS US LIVE FROM PHOENIX WITH MORE. HEY, KELLY. WE KNOW THERE IS A PROBLEM IN MARICOPA COUNTY. ARE THERE OTHER PROBLEMS?  YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT HEARING THAT RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW, THERE WAS THAT VOTING ISSUE IN MARICOPA COUNTY WITH THE PRINTERS. BUT REALLY WE ARE WAKING UP TO A LACK OF CLARITY IN WHAT IS NOW BECOMING REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO THE SENATE. I HEARD YOU MENTION THAT WE WON'T RECEIVE THAT CLARITY UNTIL FRIDAY. THAT'S BECAUSE WE DON'T EXPECT 95 TO 99% OF THE VOTE TO COME IN UNTIL THEN. I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SENATE RACE RIGHT NOW. SO ABOUT 63% REPORTING. DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT MARK KELLY LEADING BY ROUGHLY 6 POINTS. NOW, KELLY HEAVILY WON THERE IN THE EARLY VOTING BUT MASTERS HAS BEEN CLOSING THAT GAP OVERNIGHT AS DAY OF VOTING DATA TRICKLES IN. AND WE ARE SEEING THE BATCHES SKEW HEAVILY FOR THE G.O.P. BUT WITH JUST ABOUT 100,000 VOTES SEPARATING THEM UNCLEAR IF MASTERS CAN MAKE THAT UP. ON THE GOVERNOR'S SIDE. IT'S A LOT TIGHTER. KARI LAKE INCHING CLOSER TO OPPONENT KATIE HOBBS JUST ABOUT 30,000 VOTES SEPARATING THE TWO RIGHT NOW. I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT LAKE HAS BEEN WINNING THE LAST FEW BATCHES BY 70% TO 80%. ONE OF THE BIG STORY LINES I MENTIONED OFF THE TOP HAS BEEN THAT VOTING ISSUE. 27% OF THE COUNTING MACHINES IN MARICOPA COUNTY WERE DOWN FOR A PERIOD EDDY. NOW OFFICIALS IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM WITH THE PRINTERS. THEY WERE APPARENTLY NOT PRODUCING DARK ENOUGH INK TO PROPERLY MARK AND HAVE THOSE BALLOTS COUNTED. NONETHELESS, THE RNC LOSING A LAST-MINUTE SUIT AGAINST THE COUNTY TO KEEP THE POLLS OPEN AN EXTRA THREE HOURS LAST NIGHT. THE JUDGE DIDN'T FIND EVIDENCED THAT THE ISSUE IMPACTED RESIDENCE FROM VOTING. NOW, THOSE VOTING SNAFUS MEAN A LOT OF MARICOPA BALLOTS ARE OUTSTANDING. THEY ARE GOING TO START TABULATING IN A LITTLE BIT AND HAVE MORE COMING IN PRETTY SOON, BRIAN.  Brian: THANKS SO MUCH. WE WILL FOLLOW THAT OBVIOUSLY AS KARI LAKE CLOSING RAPIDLY. GO OVER TO CARLEY SHIMKUS. CARLEY, YOU HAVE MORE BREAKING NEWS AND BREAK DOWN THE OTHER RACES.  Carley: WE WILL START HERE WITH THIS THOUGH, BRIAN. ON THE NEWS A SERIAL BURGLAR ARRESTED 10 TIMES LAST YEAR IN FLORIDA IS BACK IN CUSTODY AFTER POLICE SAY THEY WERE CAUGHT RED-HANDED. THE SUSPECT IS ACCUSED OF STRIKING A DETECTIVE AFTER FLEEING THE SCENE. POLICE SAY HE HIT AT LEAST NINE HOMES WHERE TOURISTS WERE SLEEPING AFTER SERVING WHAT POLICE SAY WAS A BRIEF SENTENCE. NORTH KOREA TEST-FIRING ANOTHER BALLISTIC MISSILE OVERNIGHT. THIS ONE LANDING IN THE SEA OFF OF JAPAN JUST MINUTES AFTER LAUNCH. MEANWHILE, SOUTH KOREA'S MILITARY RECOVERING DEBRIS FROM A NORTH KOREAN MISSILE FIRED TOWARDS THE SOUTH AMID A BARRAGE OF SEA LAUNCHES FROM LAST WEEK. SOME RECOVERED PARTS OF A SOVIET ERA ANTI-CRAFT WEAPON DATING BACK TO THE 1960s. BROOKLYN NEXT GUARD TIE REIRVING MET WITH NBA COMMISSIONER ADAM SILVA YESTERDAY. THE TWO WERE SAID TO BE DISCUSSING A POTENTIAL PATH FORWARD AFTER THE NETS SUSPEND WOULD IRVING WITHOUT PAY AFTER HE DISAVOWED A MOVIE HE SHARED ON TWITTER. HE SINCE DELETED THAT TWEET. IRVING WOULD NEED TO COMPLETE SIX UNSPECIFIED STEPS BEFORE HE CAN REJOIN THE NETS. AFTER GIVING OUT FREE DONUTS ON ELECTION DAY, KRISPY KREME IS ROLLING OUT ANOTHER HOLIDAY SPECIAL. MINI PIE DONUTS. PECAN WILL HE LEMON CREAM AND DUTCH APPLE. DONUTS ARE AVAILABLE NOW IN 16-COUNT PACKS. THOSE ARE YOUR HEADLINES. BRIAN, OVER TO YOU.  Brian: GET INTO IT NOW. IT'S THE BUCKEYE STATE. LET'S START THERE, SENDING TRUMP-BACKED SENATE CANDIDATE J.D. VANCE TO A SUBSTANTIAL VICTORY. HE WINS IN OHIO AND HE TAKES SENATOR PORTMAN'S SEAT.  WHETHER YOU VOTED FOR ME OR NOT, THE THING THAT I PROMISE TO DO IS GO TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND FIGHT EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR THE PEOPLE OF OHIO. THANKS TO YOU, WE GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO JUST THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET THE GREAT PEOPLE OF OHIO. THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR TO SERVE YOU. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU EVERY DAY. GOD BLESS YOU GUYS AND THANK YOU.  Brian: LET'S BREAK DOWN WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR AND SEE WHERE IT'S GOING. POLITICAL PANEL IS HERE AND THEY ARE GREAT. FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. FORMER WISCONSIN CONGRESSMAN SEAN DUFFY IS WITH US NOW. FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" JOURNALIST REILLY. TO MY IMMEDIATE RIGHT LIVES CLOSE TO ME IN REAL LIFE LAURA KERN. AS A DEMOCRAT FOR YOU LAURA, TONIGHT, ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT DEMOCRATS AREN'T TRYING TO EXPLAIN A RED WAVE BECAUSE IT NEVER HAPPENED?  IT NEVER HAPPENED. AND I KNOW A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WERE EXPECTING. THIS I THINK WE WERE ALL EXPECTING THIS SORT OF CLEANSING THING TO HAPPEN. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME KIND OF ANSWER ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY. AND WE JUST DIDN'T GET THAT IT WAS A MIXED BAG EVERYWHERE. A LOT OF CLOSE RACES AND KIND OF A BIG MESS.  Brian: MAIN REASON, DO YOU BELIEVE IS ABORTION?  YES. I THINK WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS BEFORE THE FEAR OF TRUMP AND FEAR OF GOVERNMENT OVERREACH WITH ABORTION WAS A MOTIVATING FACTOR FOR VOTERS WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT CRIME AND THE ECONOMY. THESE TWO THINGS KEPT THEM FROM SAYING I'M GOING FOR THE SAFE BET.  Brian: A TRUMP BACKED CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA. WE KNOW J.D. VANCE WAS A TRUMP-BACKED CANDIDATE IN OHIO AND HE DID WIN A SUBSTANTIAL WIN. BUT, JASON, YOU KNOW WHO DIDN'T WIN? MASTRIANO DIDN'T WIN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE IN PENNSYLVANIA. YOU KNOW WHO DIDN'T WIN DON BOLDUC PICKED ON MONDAY. DR. OZ DIDN'T WIN WITH FETTERMAN.  IT WAS A MIXED BAG FOR TRUMP-BACKED CANDIDATES. THAT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THE POSTMORTEM. WE SHOULDN'T UNDER ESTIMATE WHAT REPUBLICANS ACCOMPLISHED. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO TAKE BACK THE HOWMPS. HOUSE OFREPRESENTATIVES. THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE CHECK ON THE BIDEN AGENDA. NO BIG OR SMALL THE MAJORITY IS. IF THEY CONTROL THE HOUSE AND SUBPOENA POWER THEY CAN DO INVESTIGATIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT THE BIDEN AGENDA DOESN'T REALLY GO ANYWHERE FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THAT'S A VERY BIG DEAL. THE REPUBLICANS DIDN'T HAVE THE NIGHT THEY WERE HOPING FOR BUT THEY ACCOMPLISHED WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO AT A MINIMUM WHICH IS TO TAKE BACK AT LEAST ONE HOUSHOUSE OF CONGRESS. WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE SENATE YET. HAD FOR IN TERMS OF TRUMP AND HIS CANDIDATES, YES, IT WAS A VERY MIXED BAG.  Brian: TWO BIG WINNERS NO DOUBT ABOUT IT IS KEMP AND DESANTIS.  YES. BOTH OF THEM HAVE BEEN IN TRUMP'S CROSSHAIRS RECENTLY AND THEY HAVE VERY BIG NIGHT. I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP IS HAPPILY ABOUT THAT. PARTICULARLY DESANTIS. WHAT HE DID WAS QUITE AMAZING IN FLORIDA LAST NIGHT.  Brian: GREAT SPEECH.  WE WILL SEE WHAT HE DOES WITH THOSE VICTORIES GOING FORWARD.  Brian: VERY INTERESTING WHAT'S HAPPENING TO FLORIDA. ONE OF THE FASCINATING STORIES. SUCCESSFULLY CLUES MAYBE REPUBLICANS SHOULD GO TO SCHOOL ON THAT. SEAN DUFFY IN WINK. RON JOHNSON WENT TO BED LISTEN I DIDN'T WIN YET. THAT'S GRESSING. I'M UP BY ONE AND LIKELY WIN WHY PEOPLE DON'T. HOW COULD MANDELA BARNES BE CLOSE?  SUNNY SIDE EGG. HE CAN BE A DOWNER. THIRD TERM IN WISCONSIN AS A U.S. SENATOR. THIS IS A BIG NIGHT FOR WISCONSIN AND FOR RON JOHNSON. MAKE NO MISTAKE OF THAT. GOING BACK TO THIS ISSUE, I DO THINK IT WAS TRUMP AND ABORTION ON THE BALLOT. I THINK A LOT OF PRO-LIFERS WOULD SAY LISTEN, I'M SO HAPPY WITH THE DOBBS DECISION. IF WE DON'T HAVE A GREAT RED WAVE MIDTERM AND ABORTION ISSUE THE DOBBS DECISION. WE WILL TAKE THAT EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK. IT'S STILL A WIN FOR PRO-LIFERS. AND TO JASON'S POINT, TO HAVE THE HOUSE IS A REALLY BIG DEAL. WE'RE FIRING NANCY PELOSI THIS MORNING. KEVIN McCARTHY IS GOING TO BE THE SPEAKER. AND THE POWER OF OVERSIGHT. I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE LEGISLATIVE PROBLEMS IF REPUBLICANS TAKE THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. HOW DO YOU GET A PATHWAY MOVING FORWARD TO GET LEGISLATION DONE. WITH ONLY ONE CHAMBER, THEY ARE GOING TO FOCUS ON OVERSIGHT. THEY WOULD HOLD THIS ADMINISTRATION ACCOUNTABLE AND THAT'S A BIG WIN FOR REPUBLICANS.  VOTERS WANTED A CHECK ON BIDEN'S AGENDA. I THINK THAT IS A BIG LESSON OF WHAT CAME OUT OF LAST NIGHT. I WILL ALSO SAY THAT ACCORDING TO THE EXIT POLLS, THE G.O.P. CONTINUED TO DO WELL WITH MINORITY VOTERS. THEY INCREASED THEIR NUMBERS AMONG BLACKS, AMONG HISPANICS AND AMONG ASIANS. IT WASN'T THE NIGHT THEY WANTED TO.  AND THE WORKING CLASS. 4 # 47 INDEPENDENCE DID GO TO DEMOCRATS WHO ARE INTERESTING IN NEW YORK. NEW YORK MIGHT DELIVER THE HOUSE FOR THE REPUBLICANS?  IT COULD HAPPEN ON RHODE ISLAND. ALL FOUR SEATS WENT REPUBLICAN. TWO BLUE NOW FOUR RED. SO, WHILE THE GOVERNOR WON, GOD BLESS THE GOVERNOR HOCHUL WON, BUT THE MESSAGING THAT NATIONAL NARRATIVE ABOUT DEMOCRATS BEING TERRIBLE ON CRIME AND THE ECONOMY ALL OF THIS, SMEARED SOME VERY GOOD MODERATE DEMOCRATS ON LONG ISLAND, ROBERT ZIMMERMAN AND LAURA WERE PAINTED WITH THIS BROAD BRUSH. THEY ARE NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO CALL CRAZY PROGRESSIVES. MODERATE, SENSIBLE, FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE DEMOCRATS AND THEY WERE SWEPT OUT.  LEE ZELDIN, YOU KNOW HIM. SUFFOLK COUNTY GUY. BUT HE DID SURPRISINGLY WELL FOR A GUY AFFILIATED WITH TRUMP KNOWN AS A CONSERVATIVE. IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS GOT WITHIN FOUR POINTS.  YES. THAT'S RIGHT. AND THAT WAS -- I KIND OF GUESSED IT WOULD BE ABOUT THAT BUT IS HE A LONG ISLAND GUY. HE COMES FROM A REGULAR WORKING CLASS FAMILY. AND HE RAN -- I HAVE TO HAND IT TO HIM HE RAN A FLAWLESS CAMPAIGN.  Brian: REAL QUICK, YOUR PREDICTION ON THE SENATE. DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO GEORGIA?  GEORGIA AND NEVADA IT LOOKS LIKE WILL BE THE TWO STATES.  Brian: NEVADA AND LAXALT UP.  TWO YEARS AGO WITH THE RUNOFF. ONE OTHER POINT. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY MAY LOSE HIS SEAT. DCCC CHAIR IN NEW YORK CITY. THAT IS THE BIGGEST OF THE NIGHT. HIGHEST DEMOCRAT TO LOSE A SEAT.  Brian: GREAT PANEL. I OWE YOU EXTRA MONEY. [LAUGHTER] MEANWHILE YOU CAN CATCH ME ON THE ROAD. I'M GOING TO MISSISSIPPI, CATCH ME IN BRANDON MISSISSIPPI. AND THEN I'M GOING TO TULSA, OKLAHOMA AND THEN TO OKLAHOMA CITY THE NEXT DAY. ON THE ONSTAGE TALKING ABOUT ALL RED, WHITE, AND BLUE STUFF AND THE PRESIDENT AND FREEDOM FIGHT TORE CLOSE IT OUT. GO TO BRIAN KILMEADE.COM. FOX NATION IS CO-PRODUCE GO AHEAD IT TOO. YOU MIGHT BE GETTING SOMETHING FREE IF YOU ARRIVE IN PERSON. COMING UP STRAIGHT AHEAD. CONTROL OF CONGRESS STILL HANG IN THE BALANCE THIS MORNING. BUT REPUBLICANS ARE SEEING SOME VICTORIES IN DEEP BLUE NEW YORK AS WE JUST DISCUSSED. ONE OF THEM, CONGRESSWOMAN ELISE STEFANIK WON HER RACE HANDILY. SHE WILL JOIN US NEXT AND TALK ABOUT HER LEADERSHIP ROLE. 20221109123725.823|20221109124107.512",

        "trs": "\u266a \u266a STEVE GEORGIA GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP CLAIMING VICTORY IN HIS RE-ELECTION BID LAST NIGHT BEATING DEMOCRAT STACEY ABRAMS FOR THE SECOND TIME BY, LOOK AT THAT CLOSE TO 8 POINTS. BUT WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR THE RESULTS OF THAT SENATE RACE, WHICH IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL, ALTHOUGH MR. WALKER IS TRAILING MR. WARNOCK. CONNELL Mc/SSHANE IS LIVE FROM ATLANTA WITH MORE. CONNELL?  HEY THERE, STEVE, IT'S INTERESTING LOOKING AT A CONVERSATION WE HAD YESTERDAY WITH A GWINNETT COUNTY GEORGIA GOVERNOR JUST VOTED FOR GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP BUT DIDN'T VOTE AT ALL IN THE SENATE RACE AND CLEAR FROM THOSE NUMBERS YOU JUST SHOWED. NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS THINKING IN THAT WAY OR DOING SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE RACE. A TALE OF TWO DIFFERENT REPUBLICAN PERFORMANCES. GOVERNOR KEMP. A LOT OF GUEST IN THE NEXT HOUR WINNING RE-ELECTION AND CERTAINLY OUT PERFORMED WHAT WE SAW FROM HERSCHEL WALKER ON THE SENATE SIDE. AND LOOK AGAIN AT THOSE NUMBERS. THAT WAS A RELATIVELY EASY WIN FOR GOVERNOR KEMP AT LEAST BY RECENT GEORGIA STANDARDS AND CERTAINLY A WIDER MARGIN THAN WHAT WE SAW THE MATCHUP THAT HE HAD WITH STACEY ABRAMS FOUR YEARS AGO. COMPARE THOSE NUMBERS AND PERCENTAGES THOUGH TO THE SENATE SIDE. HERE AGAIN THE KEY IS THAT BOTH WARNOCK AND WALKER ARE BELOW 50% AND DO APPEAR HEADED TO THAT DECEMBER 6TH RUN OFF. SO WE ALL JUST HANG IN THERE. I'M FEELING GOOD. WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT THIS RACE MAY BE CLOSE.  I'M NOT RICKY BOBBY. I DON'T COME TO LOSE. AND I TOLD YOU HE'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO BEAT. HE'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO BEAT BUT, LET ME TELL YOU WHAT, HE HAS THE WRONG GEORGIA HEAD ON HIM.  WARNOCK FOR WHAT IT IS WORTH HAS EXPERIENCE IN RUNOFFS HOW HE WON THE SEAT FIRST PLACE JANUARY THE 5TH OF 2021.  JUST POINT OUT ONE NOTE FROM OUR FOX VOTER ANALYSIS WE COME BACK 93% OF VOTERS THAT WE SPOKE TO SAY THEY CONSIDERED SENATE CONTROL WHEN THEY WERE MAKING THEIR DECISION. HE MIGHT GET TO MAKE THAT VERY SAME DECISION ALL OVER AGAIN. STEVE?  Steve: ALL RIGHT, CONNELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S TALK TO FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NEWT GINGRICH. NEWT, GOOD MORNING TO YOU.  GOOD MORNING. LOOKS LIKE DOWN IN GEORGIA TICKET-SPLITTING BECAUSE PEOPLE PRESUMABLY REPUBLICANS OR INDEPENDENCE, THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR BRIAN KEMP DID NOT ALSO VOTE FOR HERSCHEL WALKER OR ELSE HERSCHEL WOULD BE FURTHER AHEAD. RIGHT?  YEAH. I THINK, FIRST OF ALL, GOVERNOR KEMP, LIKE MANY REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS, HAD A BIG NIGHT. PROBABLY SPENT THE END OF STACEY ABRAMS CLEAR IF POLITICS. I THINK THAT HERSCHEL DID NOT GET ALL THE VOTES THAT THE GOVERNOR DID OBVIOUSLY. THAT RACE WOULD BE OVER. SO, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO GO TO A RUN OFF. GOVERNOR KEMP HAS A HUGE ABILITY, I THINK, TO INFLUENCE THAT RUNOFF. AND THIS WILL BE THE SECOND TIME THAT WARNOCK HAS ENDED UP IN A RUN OFF. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT HOW NARROW THE MARGINS ARE IN GEORGIA. BUT EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY GOVERNORS HAD A BIG NIGHT. KEMP IS AN EXAMPLE. LOOK AT THE SCALE OF THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR VICTORIES. THAT'S SOMETHING, YOU KNOW, WE DID NOT DO AS WELL IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE AS I THOUGHT WE WOULD DO AND AS I SAID ON THIS SHOW I THOUGHT WE WOULD DO SO THERE IS A LOT TO STUDY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. WE DID VERY WELL WITH GOVERNORS? THAT SENSE A HUGE NIGHT FOR REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL.  Steve: NEWT. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THE BIG RED WAVE THAT WAS PREDICTED HAS NOT HAPPENED YET AND THE BALANCE OF POWER BALANCE OF POWER STILL HANGS IN THE BALLOT. EXIT POLLS, LOOK LIKE ABORTION AND DEMOCRACY WERE TWO BIG ISSUES WITH PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY VOTED AND RIGHT NOW REPUBLICANS ARE AT 200 IN THE HOUSE FROM NEED 218. IT ABORTION AND DEMOCRACY. IN THE RUN UP EVERYBODY WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT INFLATION I THOUGHT WITH THE INFLATION RATE AND PRICE OF FOOD AND PRICE OF GASOLINE WITH THE CRIME RATE THAT WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE BORDER AS OPEN AS IT IS 4 MILLION COMING ACROSS ILLEGALLY I THOUGHT ALL OF THOSE THINGS WOULD HAVE MADE FOR A REALLY BIG REPUBLICAN NIGHT. I HAVE TO SAY AS MUCH AS I THINK IT'S DESPICABLE THE BIDEN STRATEGY OF DEMONIZING REPUBLICANS AND ATTACKING REPUBLICANS AND DEFAMING REPUBLICANS, I THINK DID HAVE AN IMPACT AND WILL PROBABLY BECOME PART OF THE DEFINITION OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  Steve: SURE. THERE WAS A RED WAVE THOUGH IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. RON DESANTIS IS GOING TO WIND UP WINNING BY CLOSE TO 20 POINTS.  I THINK GOVERNOR DESANTIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST WINNER OF THE NIGHT AND ALMOST CERTAINLY BECOME THE RALLYING POINT FOR EVERYBODY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WANTS TO MOVE BEYOND PRESIDENT TRUMP. REMARKABLE RACE. DESANTIS DID WELL AND SO FRANKLY MARCO RUBIO WHO DID ALMOST AS WELL AND PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS IN MIAMI WITH RUBIO TWO NIGHTS BEFORE THE REPUBLICANS SWEPT DADE COUNTY, WHICH, AS YOU KNOW, IS UNHEARD OF. GOVERNOR BUSH ONCE DID IT. BUT OTHER THAN THAT, REPUBLICANS HAVE NEVER HAD THE KIND OF MARGIN IN DADE COUNTY THAT BOTH RUBIO AND DESANTIS GOT. I THINK DESANTIS IS THE BIGGEST SINGLE WINNER OF THE NIGHT AND THAT'S GOING TO RESONATE ACROSS THE WHOLE COUNTRY. THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS IN GENERAL, LIKE GOVERNOR KEMP, LIKE SUNUNU, LIKE DEWINE, ABBOTT, ALL OF THEM DID VERY, VERY WELL LAST NIGHT.  Steve: ALL RIGHT. NEWT GINGRICH JOINING US WITH THE POST GAME SHOW, NEWT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU.  Steve: STILL AHEAD, AS WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT SUNSHINE FOR REPUBLICANS IN FLORIDA WITH VICTORIES ALL ACROSS THE ONE-TIME SWING STATE. WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM ANNA PAW LENA LUNA WHO FLIPPED A HOUSE SEAT RED AND TALK ABOUT RON DESANTIS BIG WIN IN MIAMI-DADE COUNTY. 20221109125706.204|20221109125903.186",

MEHMET OZ IN WHAT WAS A CRITICAL SENATE RACE FOR REPUBLICANS. AND JOSH SHAPIRO DEFEATING DOUG MASTRIANO IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE TURNING THE KEYSTONE STATE BLUE. HERE TO REACT PENNSYLVANIA BASED COLUMNIST AND REPORTER SELENA. GOOD MORNING.  GOOD MORNING, AINSLEY.  Ainsley: GOWHAT HAPPENED HERE DO YOU THINK FETTERMAN IGNORED THE WOKE. HEROIN INJECTION SITES, RELEASING CONVICTED MURDERERS NO FRACKING HE SAID A WHILE AGO AND NOW HE IS SAYING HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOR TRACK FRACKING, NO RESTRICTIONS ON ABORTION? WHAT WAS THE ISSUE HERE?  IT'S CRAZY. IT'S ASTOUNDING TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT YOU JUST PEELED OFF AND THEN YOU COMPARE THAT WITH ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE MOST IMPORTANT TO VOTERS. AND THE DECISION TO PENNSYLVANIA VOTERS MADE IS SORT OF THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT. AND THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS TO UNPACK ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA. FIRST OF ALL, I THINK FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SORT OF INTERFERENCE IN THAT PRIMARY IN MAY PUT A MAN, DR. OZ, WHO BY THE WAY I WILL SAY RAN A VERY GOOD CAMPAIGN AND HE OVERCAME A LOT FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS NEVER IN POLITICS BEFORE, AND HE OVERCAME A BIG DEFICIT; HOWEVER, HE NEVER HAD A TRUE NATURAL BASE HERE. A TRUE NATURAL CONNECTION WITH THE STATE. I THINK THAT FETTERMAN USED THAT TO ADVANTAGE. HE POUNDED HIM WITH THAT. AND IT WAS ENOUGH FOR VOTERS TO NOT FEEL AS COMFORTABLE WITH HIM IT AS THEY WOULD WITH DAVE McCORMICK. RUNNING THE WHIPPED MASTRIANO WHO NEVER RAN A CAMPAIGN THAT INCLUDED CREATING COALITIONS TO WIN AN ELECTION. AND WHEN YOU HAVE THOSE TWO DRAGS ON YOU, YOU TACK ON ALMOST A MILLION PEOPLE VOTING BEFORE THE DEBATE AND, IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH FOR HIM TO OVERCOME TRYING TO WIN OVER VOTERS IN THE STATE.  Ainsley: YEAH WE ARE LEARNING THAT WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH FROM THIS ELECTION BECAUSE OR ALL THE ELECTIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO HAVE TWO STRONG CANDIDATES FOR EACH PARTY FOR THE GOVERNOR AND FOR THE SENATE RACES. SO YOU THINK HE LOST BECAUSE OF MASTRIANO, HE WAS CRITICIZED FOR LIVING IN NEW JERSEY, BEFORE HE LIVED IN PENNSYLVANIA, I KNOW THAT THOSE TWO STATES DON'T NECESSARILY GET ALONG. WHAT ABOUT THE OPRAH ENDORSEMENT? SHE ENDORSED -- SHE IS GOOD FRIENDS WITH DR. OZ. SHE HELPED HIS CELEBRITY STATUS AND HELPED MAKE HIM A BIG NAME ON TELEVISION. DO YOU THINK THAT HURT HIM WHEN SHE ENDORSED FETTERMAN?  NO, I REALLY DON'T, YOU KNOW, PENNSYLVANIA, THE LAST STATISTICS I SAW FROM THE CENSUS SHOWS 8 OUT OF 10 PENNSYLVANIANS GREW UP WITHIN FOUR MILES OF WHERE THEY LIVE, RIGHT? SO THE PLACE AND ROOTEDNESS IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND DR. OZ WAS NEVER ABLE TO OVERCOME THAT HURDLE. AND SO I THINK THAT WAS THE LARGER PROBLEM. I THINK MASTRIANO ENDED UP BEING THE SECOND PROBLEM. I THINK DONALD TRUMP'S OVER ENDORSEMENT OF THEM TALKING ABOUT RUNNING, YOU KNOW, ON THE EVE BEFORE THE ELECTION. ALL THOSE THINGS GET IN PEOPLE'S HEADS.  Ainsley: RIGHT.  IT CAUSED A PROBLEM.  Ainsley: AND THE DEBATE WAS AFTER EARLY VOTING STARTED. I'M NOT SURE IF THAT REALLY INFLUENCES ANYONE'S VOTE. IF YOU LOOK AT HIGH CRIME IN PHILADELPHIA, IT'S A LITTLE SHOCKING AND SOME OF THE POLLS WERE COMPLETELY WRONG ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING ON WITH US.

HI, HILLARY.  HI, MARTHA. SENATOR MAGGIE HASSAN SAID SHE'S NOT SURPRISED IT'S A CLOSE RACE. SHE'S NO STRANGER TO A NAIL BITER. YOU MENTIONED SHE WON BY JUST OVER 1,000 VOTES THE FIRST TIME SHE RAN. THIS TIME HER OPPONENT, DON BOLDUC HAS EATEN IN TO HER LEAD LEADING THIS RACE NECK AND NECK. FOX DIGITAL CAUGHT UP WITH SENATOR HASSAN. HER CLOSING MESSAGE TO UNDECIDED VOTERS IS THAT DEMOCRACY AND ABORTION RIGHTS ARE ON THE BALLOT. TODAY CAPS OFF A TWO-YEAR CAMPAIGN MARATHON FOR THE GENERAL. WE CAUGHT UP WITH HIM TODAY. HE TELLS ME HE'S PUT IN THE TIME AND HE IS CONFIDENT IT WILL PAY OFF. HES WILL SAYS THIS ELECTION BOILS DOWN TO HEATING AND EATING. WE ASKED VOTERS TODAY AFTER THEY VOTED WHAT WAS THE NUMBER 1 ISSUE ON THEIR MIND THAT IMPACTED THEIR VOTE.  WOMENING REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS WOULD BE PRETTY MUCH FIRST AND FOREMOST.  PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN. ALSO KEEPING MY EYE ON SOCIAL SECURITY AT MY AGE AND MEDICARE.  I'M NOT HAPPY WITH PRICES OF HEATING AND GAS AND FOOD.  THE BIG ISSUE IS THE ECONOMY. IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT THINGS HAVE TURNED TO WHAT THEY HAVE. THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN OCCURRED SINCE THE LAST TWO YEARS.  GOT TO BE THE INFLATION. INFLATION STINKS.

I HEARD YOU SAY A FEW WEEKS AGO YOU THOUGHT YOU WOULD WIN ALL OF THESE TOSS-UP SENATE RACES. DO YOU STILL BELIEVE THAT TODAY?  I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET 52 PLUS SEATS. WE HAVE GREAT CANDIDATES. THEY'RE RUNNING GREAT RACES. WE HAVE GREAT GRASS ROOTS. BY THE WAY, THE VOTERS ARE SHOWING UP. LOOK AT ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY. VOTERS ARE SHOWING UP BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE BIDEN AGENDA IS A HORRIBLE AGENDA. WHEN WE WIN, YOU SHOULD THANK ALL OF THESE CANDIDATES THAT RAN GREAT RACES.  Martha: SO I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT YOUR LEADERSHIP AT THE RSC. WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS BEFORE. YOU HAVE GOTTEN A LOT OF PUSH-BACK ABOUT THE WAY YOU HANDLED THINGS FROM FOLKS INSIDE YOUR PARTY AND PEOPLE THAT RUN SOME OF THE GOP PACKS THAT ALSO SUPPORT THESE CANDIDATES. MARC THIESSEN WAS JUST HERE. HE BASICALLY SAID THAT THE RSC RAN OUT OF ITS $180 MILLION IN AUGUST BECAUSE YOU SPENT TOO MUCH MONEY AT THE FRONT HALF IN THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS AND RAN OUT OF MONEY. THEN THE SLC, ONE OF THE LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS THAT IS PART OF MITCH McCONNELL'S VENUE ENDED UP HAVING TO SPEND $240 MILLION AND SAVE PEOPLE IN STATES THAT THEY FELT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SPEND MONEY IN. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT?  FIRST OFF, THE D.C. CROWD WANTS TO GIVE PEOPLE CREDIT OR PEN BLAME. IT'S THE CANDIDATES THAT WIN THE RACES. HERE'S WHAT WE DID. WE DID THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY DID IN GEORGIA TWO YEARS AGO. IN GEORGIA, THEY DIDN'T DEFINE WARNOCK EARLY. I TOOK OVER AFTER WE LOST THE SENATE BACK IN 2021. I SAID WE'RE GOING TO INVEST AND DEFINE OUR OPPONENTS EARLY. GUESS WHAT? WE'RE IN THE HUNT -- IT WILL BE HARD TO GET THERE BUT WE'RE IN THE HUNT TO PICK UP HALF OF THE DEMOCRATS SEATS RIGHT NOW. I THINK WE'LL GET GEORGIA, NEVADA. WE HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE WE CAN GET ARIZONA, COLORADO. WE DID THAT BECAUSE WE DEFINED OPPONENTS EARLY AND CONTINUE TO RAISE MONEY AND HELP OUR CANDIDATES. IN THE END, WE ARE WINNING BECAUSE OUR CANDIDATES HAVE RUN GOOD RACES, THE VOTERS LIKE WHAT OUR CANDIDATES ARE TALKING ABOUT, THEY HATE THE BIDEN AGENDA AND WE HAVE GREAT TURNOVER.  Martha: WHAT DO YOU SAY ABOUT OVER WHERE DEWINE IS AHEAD BY DOUBLE DIGITS AND VANCE TOOK HIM TILL MID OCTOBER TO START TO FINALLY NARROW THAT GAP AND TOOK MORE THAN 30 MILLION TO BE BROUGHT IN LATE IN THE GAME BY THE SLC WHEN THEY COULD HAVE BEEN SPREADING THAT MONEY TO OTHER RACES AND EXPANDING THE HORIZON?  AS YOU KNOW, WE HAD HEATED PRIMARIES. J.D. VANCE WENT THROUGH A HEATED PRIMARY. WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU USE UP YOUR MONEY AND YOU HAVE TO RAISE MONEY AGAIN. SO WHAT THE CIVIC COMMITTEE DID THAT I RAN IS ALL OF THOSE PRIMARIES, WE INVESTED AFTERWARDS. IF YOU LOOK AT HISTORICALLY WHAT HAPPENS, IF WE DON'T INVEST RIGHT AWAY AND HELP OUR CANDIDATES AND DEFINE OUR OPPONENTS, WE GET SO FAR BEHIND LIKE WHAT HAPPENED IN GEORGIA TWO YEARS AGO YOU DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN. WARNOCK WAS NEVER DEFINED EARLY. AFTER THE NOVEMBER RACE WHEN WE WENT INTO THE RUN-OFF, THEY SPENT MILLIONS AND COULDN'T BEAT WARNOCK. HE ALREADY DEFINED HIMSELF. WHAT WE DID, WE HELPED OUR CANDIDATES RIGHT WHEN THEY GOT OUT OF THE PRIMARIES WHEN THEY GOT OUT OF MONEY AND DEFINED OUR OPPONENTS RIGHT AWAY. WE'RE IN THE HUNT NOW. THINK ABOUT IT. WE HAVE SEVEN STATES THAT WE CAN PICK UP. THAT WOULD BE A GREAT NIGHT IF WE DID THAT. WE'RE GOING TO PICK UP TWO AND GOING TO GET MORE THAN THAT, I BELIEVE.  Martha: LET ME ASK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION. THAT HAS TO DO WITH AFTER TONIGHT. IF YOU DO GET THE 51, 52 SEATS THAT YOU FEEL YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WIN FOR REPUBLICANS, HERE'S A QUOTE JUST A SHORT TIME AGO FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP. HE SAID THAT RICK SCOTT, HE SAID HE'S LOOKING FOR A LEADERSHIP CHANGE ON THE SENATE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND HE SAID RICK SCOTT OF FLORIDA COULD BE A LIKELY CANDIDATE CALLING HIM A VERY TALENTED GUY WHO IS HIGHLY UNDERRATED. I THINK RICK SCOTT IS THE LIKELY CANDIDATE AND THEN HE SAID HE HATES THE GUY REFERRING TO THE CURRENT LEADER IN THE SENATE, MITCH McCONNELL. WHAT DO YOU SAY, SIR?  FIRST, I ALWAYS LIKE WHEN PEOPLE SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT YOU. AIM  -- I'M APPRECIATIVE. MY FOCUS IS TO DO WHAT I HAVE DONE THE LAST TWO YEARS, MAKE SURE WE GET A MAJORITY.  WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN BECOMING THE SENATE MAJORITY LEADER A, AND B, IS THE FORMER PRESIDENT CORRECT THAT YOU HATE MITCH McCONNELL?  I DON'T DISLIKE ANYBODY. I HAVE MY BELIEVES ABOUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO GET ACCOMPLISHED UP HERE. I DON'T DISLIKE PEOPLE.  Martha: ARE YOU INTERESTING IN BEING MAJORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE?  I'M FOCUSED ON TONIGHT, MARTHA. I HAVE A JOB RIGHT NOW TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY LEADER. THAT'S MY FOCUS.  Martha: WE WILL ALL BE WATCHING. WE THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE QUESTIONS AND SPENDING TIME WITH US TODAY. OBVIOUSLY A VERY IMPORTANT DAY FOR YOU AND THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE LEADING UP TO THIS. WE'LL BE WATCHING IT IN TO THE WEE HOURS. THANKS VERY MUCH, SENATOR SCOTT. GOOD TO HAVE YOU HERE.  BYE, MARTHA.  Martha: OUR ELECTION COVERAGE CONTINUES WITH BRIT HUME COMING UP THIS HOUR AND A LIVE CHECK ON THE GOVERNOR'S RACES TO WATCH WITH OUR FOX CORRESPONDENTS ON THE GROUND ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  WE'RE FEELING GREAT. ALL THE EARLY REPORTS ARE THAT THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE OUR SUPPORTERS ARE COMING OUT STRONG.

NOT CRAZY BUSY AT THAT PARTICULAR PRECINCT IN NEW YORK CITY AT 3:30 THIS AFTERNOON. THE GOVERNOR'S RACE HAS BECOME VERY TIGHT IN RECENT WEEKS. SIX OTHER STATES HAVE GOVERNOR'S RACES THAT ARE TOSS-UPS. ALL OF US DOING THE COVERAGE TIGHT WILL BE UP FOLDING ALL OF THESE RACES AS THEY COME IN AND GIVING GREAT ANALYSIS OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ALL OF THEM. ONE OF THEM IS WISCONSIN WHERE WE'LL TAKE YOU LIVE IN JUST A MOMENT. BUT FIRST TO MATT FINN. LET'S SWING OVER TO THE SOUTHWEST TO NEW MEXICO WHICH IS ALSO A TOSS-UPSTATE. HE'S IN A BASKETBALL JAM, WHICH IS WHERE WE FIND VOTERS ON A DAY LIKE THIS. HI, MATT.  HI, MARTHA. THE LATEST NUMBERS FROM NEW MEXICO'S SECRETARY OF STATE AT THIS HOUR. SO FAR 72,000 MORE DEMOCRATS HAVE VOTED IN THIS STATE IN EARLY PERSON AND IN-PERSON VOTING. BUT WE TALKED A SHORT WHILE AGO TO MARK RONCHETTI. HE SAYS THAT REPUBLICANS WILL SHOW UP TO VOTE IN PERSON TODAY. RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN THE LARGEST COUNTY IN NEW MEXICO. IT'S A DEMOCRATIC STRONG HOLD. THIS VOTING LOCATION HAS BEEN ORGANIZED. WE'VE SEEN NO ISSUES. IN FACT, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR MARK RONCHETTI CAST HIS VOTE HERE TODAY. THE DEMOCRAT IS CONSIDERED THE FRONTRUNNER. BUT RONCHETTI'S PATH TO VICTORY HAS TO INCLUDE WINNING OVER HISPANICS THAT MAKE UP 40% OF NEW MEXICO'S VOTERS. GOVERNOR GRISHAM CAMPAIGNED ON KEEPING ABORTION LEGAL. RONCHETTI CAMPAIGNED ON CAMPAIGNED ON THE BORDER. THE NUMBER 1 ISSUE IS THE ECONOMY. WE TALKED TO VOTERS. THEY SAID THEY'RE VOTING ON INFLATION AND GAS PRICES. ALSO WORTH NOTING, RONCHETTI RELEASED TEXTS THAT HE SAID A LOCAL TV EMPLOYEE SENT TO GRISHAM'S CAMPAIGN DURING HER 2018 RUN. HE SAID THE TEXTS TIPPED OFF GRISHAM ABOUT DEBATE TOPICS AND QUESTIONS. RONCHETTI SAYS THE TEXTS ARE RELEVANT IN THIS RACE BECAUSE THEY REVEAL GOVERNOR GRISHAM IS A CHEATER. WE CAUGHT UP WITH THE GOVERNOR AND ASKED HER IF SHE WANTED TO DENY RECEIVING THOSE TEXTS.  GOVERNOR, MARK RONCHETTI SAYS YOU HAVE NOT DENIED THAT YOUR CAMPAIGN RECEIVED THOSE 2018 DEBATE TEXTS. DO YOU WANT TO DENY THAT YOU RECEIVED THEM?  ALL OF THE CHARACTER ATTACKS ARE OUTRAGEOUS AND FALSE.  ARE YOU GOING TO DENY IT?  DENIED.  OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME THE GOVERNOR DENIED RECEIVING THE TEXTS ON CAMERA. A FORMER CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON FOR THE GOVERNOR THAT SETTLED THE SEXUAL ASSAULT CLAIM SAID SHE DID IN FACT RECEIVE THE TEXTS AND HER CAMPAIGN USED THEM TO HER ADVANTAGE. MARTHA?  Martha: INTERESTING REPORTING. MATT, THANK YOU. MATT FINN IN NEW MEXICO. LET'S GO TO ANOTHER TOSS-UP RACES IN WISCONSIN TODAY. DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR TONY EVERS FACING REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER TIM MICHAELS, A BUSINESS MAN FROM WISCONSIN. GRADY TRIMBLE REPORTS LIVE ON THIS ONE FROM OSHKOSH. HI, GRADY.  HI, MARTHA. THE BADGER STATE'S GOVERNOR'S RACE IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE COUNTRY. IT COULD COME DOWN TO THE ONE KITCHEN TABLE ISSUE THAT VOTERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. INFLATION. TIM MICHELS HAS MADE THE CASE THAT HE'S BETTER EQUIPPED TO TACKLE THAT ISSUE PARTLY BECAUSE OF HIS BACKGROUND IN BUSINESS. HE'S ALSO BEEN HITTING DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR TONY EVERS ON CRIME AND EDUCATION. EVERY VOTER I'VE TALKED TO TODAY SAYS THE ECONOMY AND INFLATION IS THEIR NUMBER 1 ISSUE.  IT'S IMPACTED OUR SAVINGS AND OUR RETIREMENT.  WE'RE HEADED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. THAT IS -- IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.  GOING BACK TO THE BUSINESSES, EVERYTHING IS MORE EXPENSIVE FOR THEM, A LOT OF BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING THEIR DOORS. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT.  HOW IS IT IMPACTING ME?  YEAH.  MY WALLET IS EMPTY.  THERE'S ALSO A SENATE SEAT UP FOR GRABS IN WISCONSIN TODAY. REPUBLICAN SENATOR RON JOHNSON VOTED HERE THIS MORNING. HE TOLD ME HE'S FEELING CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT HIS CHANCES AGAINST PROGRESSIVE LIEUTENANT GORVERNOR MANDELA BARNES. REPUBLICANS SHOULD CONSIDER IT A DEAD EVEN RACE. IN FACT, IF BOTH OF THOSE RACES ON THE SENATE BALLOT ARE DECIDED BY LESS THAN THREE POINTS, THAT WOULD BE A FIRST IN WISCONSIN STATE HISTORY. THIS IS A STATE THAT IS USED TO CLOSE ELECTIONS. MARTHA?  Martha: NOT A PARTICULARLY QUICK COUNTING STATE. WE'LL BE PATIENT AND HANG IN THERE LATE NIGHT NOR WISCONSIN. GRADY, THANK YOU. LET'S SWING BACK TO THE EAST COAST NOW. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FASCINATING RACE THAT HAS PLAYED OUT IN NEW YORK. FOX POWER RANKINGS SHIFTED THIS GOVERNOR'S RACE FROM LIKELY DEMOCRAT WHERE IT WAS PRETTY MUCH THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE THING TO JUST LEANING DEMOCRAT JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO. IT WAS SOLID BLUE AS I SAID PRIOR TO THAT. ALEXIS McADAMS IS LIVE AT A POLLING PLACE IN NEW YORK CITY. WHAT DO YOU KNOW, ALEXIS?  HI, MARTHA. IT HAS BEEN TOO BUSY. IT'S BEEN PICKING UP. TALKING TO THE VOTERS, A LOT SAY CRIME IS THEIR TOP ISSUE IN THIS RACE. ALL EYES ARE ON THE NEW YORK GOVERNOR'S RACE. CLOSER THAN EXPECTED IN DEEP BLUE NEW YORK. CONGRESSMAN ZELDIN SAID IT'S A NUMBERS GAME. HE SAYS IF HE GETS MORE THAN 30% OF THE VOTE IN NEW YORK CITY, HE WILL BE THE NEXT GOVERNOR.  WE HAVE ENOUGH SUPPORT OUT THERE TO WIN THE RACE. BUT PEOPLE HAVE TO GET TO THE POLLS. WE CAN'T GET LESS THAN 30% IN NEW YORK CITY. IF WE GET LESS THAN 30%, WE DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN WIN THE RACE.  CONGRESSMAN ZELDIN HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON CRIME IN NEW YORK CITY TRYING TO CONVINCE AS MANY INDEPENDENT VOTERS AS POSSIBLE THAT HE'S THEIR GUY. VOTERS I TALKED TO SAY THEY'RE FED UP WITH THE DIRECTION THE CITY IS HEADING IN.  I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK TO THE WAY IT WAS IF THEY TINKER WITH THESE THINGS AND CAUSED A LOT OF TROUBLE.  NEW YORK CITY VOTERS ARE A PRIORITY FOR GORKA THINK HOCHUL AS WELL. SHE SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE CITY. SHE WAS CAMPAIGNING AT A SENIOR CENTER ON THE UPPER WEST SIDE. HOCHUL SAYS IF DEMOCRATS COME OUT, SHE WILL WIN.  NEW YORK CITY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. WE'LL SEE A MAJOR TURNOUT OVER OVER IN MANHATTAN, BROOKLYN. THE EARLY VOTING NUMBERS ARE ASTOUNDING. THAT'S A GOOD BAROMETER FOR US. THOSE THAT KNOW ME, I GUT IT OUT TILL THE END. YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE TAPE.  AS OF NOON, THE NEW YORK CITY BOARD OF ELECTIONS, MORE THAN 884,000 PEOPLE HAVE CAST THEIR BALLOTS INCLUDING EARLY VOTERS. ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE, VOTERS ARE STILL TRICKLING IN. POLLS CLOSE AT 9:00 TONIGHT. MARTHA?  Martha: THANKS. 9:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME THE NEW YORK POLLS CLOSE. THANKS, ALEXIS. SO DEMOCRAT PENNSYLVANIA CANDIDATE JOHN FETTERMAN TAKES LEGAL ACTION IN AN EFFORT TO COUNT MAIL-IN BALLOTS WITH INCORRECT OR NO DATES ON THEM. THEY'RE STILL FIGURING THIS OUT IN PENNSYLVANIA. BYRON YORK, FORMER RNC CHAIR ALSO JOINING US, REINCE PRIEBUS JOINS US WHEN ELECTION DAY CONTINUES. 20221108210835.910|20221108211239.853",

WE'RE SEEING A GOOD TURNOUT FROM THE REPORTS THAT WE'RE GETTING AND WE'LL SEE HOW IT DEVELOPS THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE DAY. THOSE ARE ALL TOSS-UP STATES. THEY'LL SAY IN WHO HAS A CONTROL OF THE SENATE AS WE LOOK AT THAT. SOME HAVE ALREADY SLAMMED THEIR OWN PARTY FOR MISSING THE MARK IN THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. IN THE CLOSING ARGUMENTS. WATCH THIS.  WITH THIS KIND OF FOOL'S GOLD, THIS IDEA THAT THE THREAT TO DEMOCRACY IS SO SEVERE THAT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAD TO TALK ABOUT. YOU ALSO HAD TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY.  I THINK THE PRESIDENT'S CLOSING MESSAGE LAST NIGHT ABOUT D DEMOCRACY ON THE BALLOT AGAIN IS FRUSTRATING. TO ME PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO SEE HALF THE VOTERS IN AMERICA ALIENATED OR SAYING -- BEING ACCUSED OF ALIGNING WITH FASCIST BECAUSE THEY'RE VOTING FOR THEIR POCKETBOOK.  BRIT HUME IS HERE WITH ME IN NEW YORK. GETTING READY FOR BIG COVERAGE IN A COUPLE HOURS. GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE WITH US TODAY. HILLARY ROSEN, A VETERAN DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST FROM THE CLINTON CAMP. SHE'S THROWING THE RED FLAG UP.  SHE'S NOT WRONG IN A SENSE. YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS SEEM OBSESSED WITH ISSUES THAT ARE NOT HIGH ON VOTER'S PRIORITY LIST. IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CRIME AND INFLATION AND YOUR A DEMOCRAT AND YOU SUPPORTED WHAT YOU SUPPORTED, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY? EVERYTHING I DID IS WRONG? MY VOTES ARE WRONG? IT'S A CASE BY CASE DEAL. BUT YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE GOING TO SAY SOMETHING, IF YOU'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING, HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY. IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME AT THIS POINT THE DEMOCRATS HAD A LOT TO SAY THAT DIDN'T CONTRADICT WHAT THEY HAD DONE AND SAID BEFORE AT THIS STAGE OF THIS RACE.  Martha: YEAH, IT'S THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS THE MESSAGING OR ACTUAL POLICY THAT IS --  IT'S THE RESULTS.  Martha: HERE'S GAVIN NEWSOME TALKING ABOUT IT. WATCH THIS.  WE'RE GETTING CRUSHED ON NARRATIVE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO BETTER IN TERMS OF GETTING ON THE OFFENSE AND STOPPING BEING ON THE DAMN DEFENSE. I'M NOT PAID TO SAY THAT I'M PAID TO SAY, YOU KNOW -- I GET IT. LOOK, I CAN BE THE CHAIR LEADER. I'M ALSO PRAGMATIST. YOU FEEL IT.  THIS PRESIDENT HAS THE PRESIDENCY, THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. SO YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GOING TO BE DEFENDING EVERYTHING THEY'VE BEEN DOING BY THE NATURE OF THAT.  THE TRUTH IS, WITH RESPECT TO WHAT NEWSOME SAYS, THEY'VE BEEN ON THE OFFENSIVE. THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET ON THE OFFENSIVE. THAT'S WHAT THIS DEMOCRACY IS ON THE BALLOT NONSENSE IS ABOUT. DEMOCRACY IS THE BALLOT, BY THE WAY. THEY'VE BEEN TRYING THEIR BEST TO GO ON THE OFFENSIVE ABOUT ABORTION. THE ONLY ISSUES THAT CUT IN THEIR FAVOR. THE PROBLEM IS, IF THEY WANT TO TALK WHAT ABOUT THE ISSUES TOP OF MINDS WITH VOTERS RIGHT NOW, THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT SOMETHING TO SAY AND THEY'RE ON DEFENSE. THERE'S NO WAY OFF OF IT. THESE ARE THE POLICIES THAT HAVE GIVEN US THE INFLATION AND THE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE HAVING, CRIME, BORDER MESS AND ALL OF THAT. I DON'T SEE HOW THEY GET ON THE OFFENSIVE ON THOSE ISSUES.  Martha: YOU WONDER -- SEEMS LIKE ENCINCUMBENTS WAIT TILL AF THE MID-TERMS. OKAY. WE HAVE A MESSAGE. DO YOU SEE JOE BIDEN CHANGING?  I SEE A COUPLE SCENARIOS. IF THEY LOSE THE HOUSE, BUT IT'S NOT A COMPLETE BLOW-OUT, NOT A MESSIVE WAVE AND MANAGE TO HOLD ON TO THE SENATE OR LOSE IT NARROWLY, THE PRESIDENT MAY DECIDE WE CAME CLOSE. WE DEBT BETTER THAN EXPECTED. NO NEED TO MAKE A BIG CHANGE AND REVERSE MYSELF. BUT IF IT'S -- IF THEY LOSE BOTH AND THE MARGIN IS SIGNIFICANT AND EVERYBODY SAYS BIG WAVE, BLOW-OUT, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, MR. PRESIDENT? YOU KNOW, HE HAS SOME HISTORY OF BEING A DEAL MAKER. HE AND MITCH McCONNELL USED TO DO A LOT OF BUSINESS. THEY GOT ALONG VERY WELL. THEY WERE FRIENDLY. BIDEN IS A VERY FRIENDLY GUY, BY THE WAY. EASY TO GET ALONG WITH PERSONALLY.  Martha: HE SAID THAT WHEN HE WAS RUNNING. MITCH McCONNELL AND I HAVE WORKED TOGETHER FOR YEARS.  EXACTLY. I'VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT WITH THE CANDIDATES THAT ARE LEFT, IF A LOT OF THESE MODERATES, SO CALLED, THE MORE MODERATES LOSE, THE CAUCUS WILL BE MORE LEFTISH THAN IT IS NOW AND HARDER FOR A PRESIDENT AND A PARTY LEADER TO STEER THEM IN TO NEGOTIATIONS WITH REPUBLICANS. WE'LL SEE. HE HAS TO MAKE SOME KIND OF COURSE CORRECTION. YOU KEEP DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING. THAT IS THE DEFINITION FOR INSANITY.  Martha: WHAT IS YOUR FEEL FOR TONIGHT? WE CAN'T PROJECT ANYTHING UNTIL IT STARTS HAPPENING. HAVING WATCHED A LOFT OF ELECTIONS, WHAT DOES YOUR GUT TELL YOU?  I BELIEVE CIRCUMSTANCES, RESULTS ARE WHAT MATTER AT THE BALLOT BOX. LOOKING AT WHAT WE'VE SEEN, THE CONDITIONS IN THE COUNTRY, LOOKS LIKE A BIG REPUBLICAN WIPE-OUT. BUT THE MAP IS BAD FOR THE REPUBLICAN, REALLY BAD. THEY'RE LOOKING SO OH DEMOCRATS ARE DEFENDING ON 14 SEATS. THAT'S NOT THAT MANY. REPUBLICANS ARE DEFENDING 21. IT'S A BAD MAP.  Martha: BECAUSE OF GAINS THAT WERE MADE IN THE LAST --  EXACTLY. NOT JUST THAT BECAUSE OF WHAT SEATS ARE UP. AND THEY GAINED -- THEY DIDN'T LOSE A SINGLE SEAT IN 2020. THE REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE. THEY DIDN'T LOSE A SINGLE SEAT. SO THEY'RE FACING A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE WHERE A LOT OF THE LOW-HANGING FRUIT HAS BEEN PICKED. END|20221108205955|2022-11-08_2000_US_FOX-News_The_Story_With_Martha_MacCallum ",

I FEEL LIKE A WRESTLING ANNOUNCER. [LAUGHTER]  Bret: THAT WAS GOOD.  Harris: THANK YOU. BRETT IS MY FRIEND. THE CANDIDATES AND PARDONS HAVE HAD THEIR SAY, AND NOW IT'S YOUR TURN. CONTROL OF THE SENATE COULD COME DOWN TO JUST A HANDFUL OF STATES, AS DEMOCRATS ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP THEIR GRIP ON POWER. PRESIDENT BIDEN, STANDING FIRM ON HIS CLOSING MESSAGE THAT \"DEMOCRACY IS ON THE BALLOT.\" IT'S DEMOCRACY WHEN WE VOTE.  President Biden: PLENTY OF THOSE MOMENTS COME AROUND EVERY 3-4 GENERATIONS. WE KNOW THAT DEMOCRACY IS AT RISK, AND THAT THIS IS YOUR MOMENT TO DEFEND IT, PRESERVE OR PROTECT IT, CHOOSE IT.  Harris: THE PRESIDENT MIGHT NOT BE SURE THAT VOTERS ARE BUYING THIS, AND -- MORE DIFFICULT NIGHT.  President Biden: I OPTIMISTIC, BUT I'M ALWAYS OPTIMISTIC.  WILL THE DEMOCRATS WIN THE HOUSE?  IT WILL BE TOUGH. I THINK THE HOUSE --  A LUNAR ECLIPSE THERE. [LAUGHTER]  Harris: EMILY, I'M STARTING WITH YOU THEN. [LAUGHTER]  Emily: AT HIS RALLY LAST NIGHT, HE SHOWED IMPATIENCE, THE INABILITY TO TAKE CRITICISM, PUSHBACK, WITH ANY GRACE. HE SAID TO A HECKLER \"YOU ARE CRAZY, DON'T JUMP.\" IF THAT HAD BEEN A G.O.P. CANDIDATE FOR AN OFFICIAL WITH A R NEXT TO THE NAME, CAN YOU IMAGINE THE BACKLASH? THEY ALSO COVER UP FOR THEM. PETER BAKER TALKED ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATION AND SAID THAT HE FACES A NATION AS POLARIZED AS EVER, NOT TAKING ACCOUNTABILITY OR ARTICULATING THE REASONS BEHIND THE POLARIZED NATURE OF THIS NATION, BUT SAYS THAT THE PRESIDENCY THAT HE ENVISIONED, THAT IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD SIMPLY GOVERN WELL, THAT EVERYTHING WOULD WORK OUT, WHICH -- STRUCK AS A SHOCKINGLY, SOMEWHAT ENDEARING. I ARGUE THAT HE DIDN'T GOVERN WELL. IT'S VERY SURPRISING. THE REALITY IS THAT DISAP VOTERE SORELY DISAPPOINTED WITH BOTH.  SOME OF THE CRITICISM IS NOT JUST FROM CERTAIN PERSPECTIVES THAT HE DIDN'T GOVERN WELL. IT'S WAS THAT EVEN EVER THE GOAL? NOW IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS A LITMUS TEST IN TERMS OF WHETHER YOU GOT COMPANY WITH THE PRESIDENT AND HOW MUCH GREEN ENERGY YOU ARE GOING TO GET. LOOK AT HIS CLOSING MESSAGE! ANYTHING THAT ANYBODY THOUGHT HE IS SAYING OUT LOUD NOW.  Bret: THE QUIET PART OUT LOUD. WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THE ELECTION FOR THIS SHOW A QUESTION MARK [LAUGHTER]  Harris: WE DON'T HAVE TO, BECAUSE BRET HAS A GREAT GOLF GAME. [LAUGHTER]  Bret: MY MENTOR AND FRIEND SAID SOMETHING THE OTHER DAY THAT I THINK YOU HIT MOMENT WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN ARE THE WORST THING THAT HAPPENS TO HIM GOVERNING LIES WAS THE LOSS -- THE WIN FOR DEMOCRATS IN GEORGIA FOR THOSE TWO SEATS AND TAKING OVER THE U.S. SENATE. HAD THAT HAPPENED WITH REPUBLICANS, HE WOULD'VE BEEN THE JOE BIDEN EVERYBODY REMEMBERS HIM AS, NEGOTIATING WITH MITCH McCONNELL AND BEING MORE MODERATE PRESIDENT, BUT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN, HE WAS CONVINCED TO TRY TO BECOME FDR AND DO THESE BIG TRANSFORMATIONAL THINGS BECAUSE HE LIVED IN THE SHADOW OF PRESIDENT OBAMA AND WANTED TO DO SOMETHING BIGGER. THAT IS MAYBE WHAT WE ARE SEEING HERE. THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS TO DO, BUT ELECTORAL RELIEF, AHEAD OF AN ELECTION WHERE YOU HAVE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES TRYING TO HANG ON, THAT'S NOT THE BEST CLOSING MESSAGE.  Harris: HE MAY HAVE WANTED TO BE FDR, BUT ALL HE HAD TO DO WAS ON T -- WAS RE-FLIP THOSE -- FROM A PARK DIFFERENT NAME, PARTICULARLY ON THE BORDER.  Martha: NO DOUBT. I THINK THAT IS AN ASTUTE POINT, CONSIDERING -- PRESIDENT BIDEN BROUGHT A NICE HISTORIAN, SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED FDR PERHAPS HAS A ROLE MODEL, TURNED OUT NOT TO BE THE CASE. WHAT I THINK IS INTERESTING IS THE POSTURING AHEAD OF TOMORROW. THE RNC SPOKESPERSON IN 2018 -- THE WRITING ON THE WALL DID NOT LOOK GOOD FOR US. WE LOST 41 HOUSE SEATS AS REPUBLICANS THAT WE DEAD NET TWO SENATE SEATS. I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE TEMPORARY EXPECTATIONS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. ONE WHITE HOUSE ADVISOR TOLD \"POLITICO\" THAT USUALLY THE  -- IT'S A CATASTROPHE, COULD BE TONIGHT. WE WILL SEE, BUT WHAT I CAN'T GET ON BOARD WITH IN TERMS OF TEMPORARY EXPECTATIONS IS THE SECOND TALKING POINT THEY GIVE. THEY EXECUTED A POLICY AGENDA, THE WHITE HOUSE DID, THEY GIVE CANDIDATES MORE THAN ENOUGH TO CAMPAIGN ON. YES, THE INFLATION REDUCTION A ACT, THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. BY HISTORICAL STANDARDS, THEY ARE MORE POPULAR THAN THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, BUT YOU ALSO GIVE US 13 DEAD MARINES IN AFGHANISTAN, A BUCKLED EXIT, 40 YEAR FORTY-YEAR HIGH INFLATION, GAS PRICES $1 ABOVE WHERE THE FORMER PRESIDENT LEFT, AND THERE'S A REASON WHY CANDIDATES DON'T WANT TO WELCOME YOU, PRESIDENT BIDEN, ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. YOU GIVE TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION, BUT FOR MORE OF THAT --  Harris: MARTHA, YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT ENERGY. YOU WOULD THINK THAT AT LEAST SOME OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY COULD HAVE GONE TO SHORING US UP RATHER THAN HAVING TO TAP OUR OIL RESERVES, AND THAT WE WILL TAP HEATING OIL.  Martha: I AM STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT NONE OF THE CAMPAIGNING IS FOCUSED ON POINTING TO SOME INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS $1.9 TRILLION? WHERE ARE THESE PROJECTS? WHERE ARE THE JOBS ATTACHED TO THEM AND WHY AREN'T WE SEEING IT IN MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSIN. TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. THE TOWN IS THRIVING BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL THESE JOBS. THE SAME AS FLEW WITH THE INFLATION -- THE SAME IS TRUE WITH THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT. PEOPLE WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER IT PASSED. YOU CANNOT JUST PASS SOMETHING AND HAVE PEOPLE FEEL GREAT ABOUT IT. THEY HAVE TO FEEL IT IN THEIR LIVES, THEY ARE NOT SEEING INFLATION REDUCTION, AND NOW THEY WANT THE REASONS -- THAT THEY ARE ASKING HUGE QUESTIONS. WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT A 30-FORTY-YEAR CHANGE, I THINK HE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT, AND WE MAY SEE TONIGHT AND IN THE COMING DAYS THAT THERE IS A POLITICAL SHIFT HAPPENING THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN EVERY ELECTION SEASON. IT HAPPENS EVERY SEVERAL DEC DECADES. YOU LOOK AT THE HISPANIC VOTE, POTENTIALLY THE WOMEN'S VOTE THAT LOOKS LIKE 1996 GOING TO CLINTON, AND THIS TIME IT MIGHT BE GOING THE OTHER WAY, AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT DIFFERENT POCKETS OF DEMOGRAPHIC VOTERS, INCLUDING THE BLACK VOTE, WE MAY BE EXPERIENCING ONE OF THOSE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS QUITE FAMILIAR WITH, HAVING SEEN A FEW OF THEM.  Harris: PARTICULARLY BLACK MEN IN GEORGIA. STACEY ABRAMS IS TRYING TO CONVINCE THEM THAT THEY ARE VICTIMIZED, CAN'T, IN THEIR KITCHENS HAVING A BEVERAGE SAYING \"I WILL JUST NOT VOTE FOR YOU.\"  Bret: ON THIS DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN ROE V. WADE WAS OVERTURNED, DEMOCRATS SAW AN OPENING, A SHIFT, THEY WENT HARD ON ABORTION, BUT BY DOING THAT, THEY ALSO DIVIDED THEIR BASE: HISPANICS, LATINOS, A LOT OF PRO-LIFE. BLACKS. THEY ARE MORE PRO-LIFE THAN THEY ARE REPUBLICAN. BY DOING THAT AND GOING SO HARD ON ABORTION THAT EARLY, THEY SHIFTED SOME OF THAT VOTE AS WELL. IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY INTERESTING. THEY WENT AFTER THE SUBURBAN WHITE WOMEN VOTE, BUT A LOT OF THOSE VOTES ARE CONCERNED ABOUT EDUCATION, CRIME, THE ECONOMY.  Harris: THE BALL MOVED. THEY DO HAVE MOMENTUM IN JUNE AFTER THE OVERTURNING OF ROE VS. WADE. IF YOU LOOK AT THAT MOMENTUM, YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WOULD THINK THAT WOULD HAPPEN, BUT IT'S KIND OF BEEN A CENTERPIECE OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, IS TO IGNORE THE FACTS ON THE GROUND. WHEN THEY STARTED TO SHIFT, DEMOCRATS DID NOT SHIFT WITH THEM, NOT WITH THEIR MESSAGING OR POLICIES.  Martha: THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FAIR. THE ADVERTISING IS OUT OF STEP WORK -- WE ARE SEEING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FLOWING INTO CERTAIN RACES, LIKE A WASHINGTON RACE, WHERE THEY ARE TRYING TO END -- HERE AS WELL, THEY ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE PEOPLE \"WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT CRIME AND KNOW THAT YOU DON'T FEEL SAFE.\" IT LOOKS LIKE A DOLLAR -- A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT.  SOME OF THE FEEDBACK WE ARE GETTING IS THAT THE DEMOCRATS SPENT A LOT OF EMPHASIS -- BUT FAILED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXTREMISM WITHIN THEIR OWN PARTY, THEIR OWN CANDIDATES, AND THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF VOTERS SAW, A LOT OF EXTREMISM ON THE TABLE EARLY ON.  I THINK THEY EMBRACE IT IN QUIET TIMES. [LAUGHTER] AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM FOR THEM, THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. BUT THINGS CAN BE SHIFTING, AS MARTHA SAID. YOU KNOW THE SAYING BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR. I NEVER SAY THAT BECAUSE I ALWAYS WISH FOR SHOES. [LAUGHTER] REPUBLICANS WHO COULD COME OUT ON TOP TODAY, AFTER GETTING A BIG MONEY BOOST FROM DEMOCRATS. THAT'S WHAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT. DEMOCRATS SPENT THEIR MONEY ON THE FAR RIGHT REPUBLICANS, TRYING TO PROP UP PEOPLE THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD BE, AND NOW THEY MAY END UP LOSING TO THEM. THAT'S NEXT. \u266a \u266a 20221108171037.117|20221108171455.108",

LET'S PLAY THE CHIEF OF STAFF AND PRESS SECRETARY --  SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR, THERE ARE NO MEETINGS OR ANYTHING HAPPENING LIKE THAT IN PREPARING FOR A RECESSION.  WE ARE NOT IN A RECESSION.  I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN A MACRO OR MICRO ECONOMICS COURSE. THEY ARE INTERESTED IN FOOD AND GAS.  IT'S ABOUT KIDS AT THE KITCHEN TABLE -- BUT HERE'S WHAT HAVE.\" HAVE TO GET TO THE END OF THE MONTH. THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION IS REALLY MISSING THE WHOLE DEAL. OTHER COMMENTATORS HAVE SAID THAT REPUBLICANS -- FOR THE WORD \"INFLATION.\" DEMOCRATS HAVE -- THE SO-CALLED INFLATION REDUCTION ACT, AND IT IS NOT CURRENTLY, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS THEY HAVE. PEOPLE FEEL IT. IT'S ABOUT FEELING IT WITH THE ECONOMY, PERSONALLY.  NO DOUBT. THE SENATE NOMINEE IN ARIZONA FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY PROSECUTED A CASE VERY WELL ON INFLATION, TURNED HIS OPPONENTS AND SAID \"I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU, $5 TRILLION INTO THE MARKET IS WHAT YOU VOTED FOR. DO YOU REGRET THE SPENDING?\" TO WHICH THE ANSWER FROM MICHAEL BENNET WAS \"I REGRET THE INFLATION.\" HE ASKED HIM AGAIN AND DOUBLE DOWN. THE ANSWER FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WAS \"I REGRET THE INFLATION BUT NOT THE CAUSE OF IT,\" WHICH I THINK VOTERS ARE AWARE OF AT THIS POINT: IT'S THE SPENDING.  I WATCHED IT --  Martha: WATCHING IT YET PUT TOGETHER, WHAT ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT? INFLATION HAS GONE FROM 1.4% AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO 8.2. THAT'S A VERY BIG JUMP. IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPH, YOU WILL SEE THAT IT CLIMBS STEADILY AND STARTS TO REALLY CLIMB OVER THE PAST 4-6 MONTHS. I DID NOT MAJOR IN ECONOMICS, BUT I REMEMBER WHERE THEY SAID TO GO BACK-TO-BACK PERIODS OF NEGATIVE GROWTH IS A RECESSION. WE HAD THAT, THEN WE HAD A SMALL GROWTH PERIOD AFTER THAT. BY ALL THOSE MEASURES, WE HAVE INFLATION AND A RECESSION. WE'VE ASKED PEOPLE \"DO YOU THINK WE WILL BE IN A RECESSION?\" 70% SAY WE ARE IN OR ABOUT TO BE IN ONE, SO IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHAT MATTERS IS CONSUMER SENTIMENT, AND THERE IS VERY WEAK CONSUMER SENTIMENT. PEOPLE DON'T GET IT -- THEY GET IT! THEY GET IT EVERY DAY WHEN THEY PAY FOR GAS, THEY GET IT WHEN THEY GO TO THE GROCERY STORE. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS. THEY ARE THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE ANSWERING THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY FEEL LIKE SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED, OR OPPORTUNITIES TO FIX THEM YOURSELF HAVE BEEN PROVIDED THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO WATCH THEM FOLD. THAT'S WHAT'S SO INTERESTING.  AND YOU THINK ABOUT -- THERE IS THE CHEF BOYARDEE COMMENT, COULD LOSE HIS SEAT TONIGHT. IF HE DOES, I THINK THAT COMMONS IS A TAKE AWAY FROM THE ELECTION OF UNDERESTIMATING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, INFLATION, AND TRIVIALIZING AN ISSUE THAT'S NUMBER ONE ON EVERY --  AND IF YOU ARE CHEF BOYARDEE, YOU ARE REALLY MAD AT HIM TOO.  HIS WHOLE THING ABOUT \"I'VE BEEN IN YOUR SHOES, MY FAMILY WAS THERE, HERE'S HOW WE DID IT.\" THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR FROM A LEADER. I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU CAN MAKE MY ROLE BETTER. I'M NOT HIRING YOU TO GIVE ME YOUR PERSONAL HISTORY. I DON'T NEED THE BACKGROUND STORY. I NEED WHAT YOUR FUTURE THOUGHTS ARE GOING TO BE. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT'S TYPICAL OF ANY VOTER IN AMERICA ON ANY ISSUE. NOT SURE THAT THAT WAS GOING TO WORK, NOT JUST FOR MALONEY, BUT ANY OF THE DEMOCRATS. ANYTIME YOU SEE BARACK OBAMA CUTE IS NOW -- THEY ARE OUT OF IDEAS ON THE LEFT. THEY HAVE REFLEXIVELY GONE TO THE ONE STAR THEY HAD AND EVEN HE COULD NOT TACKLE IT, COULDN'T STAY ON THAT, AND HE TOGGLED RIGHT BACK TO THE DEMOCRACY OR WHATEVER THE FLAVOR OF THE DAY WAS IN THE LAST 96 HOURS. AND BY THE WAY, THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT DOESN'T EVEN TOUCH THE DEFICIT IN A MEANINGFUL WAY UNTIL 2041.  AND THEN I GOT TOTALLY ERASED BY THE STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS.  SEAN PATRICK MALONEY, IN FAIRNESS TO HIM, IT WAS NOT -- WHICH WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THEIR TALK IS THAT IT'S HOLDING STEADY, WHICH IS LIKE SAYING \"MY CHILD'S GPA IS HOLDING STEADY AT 2.0.\" NO ONE WOULD APPLAUD THEIR CHILD FOR THAT, HOLDING STEADY AT A FOUR-YEAR HIGH.  I'M SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP. AS YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW VOTERS AND AMERICANS NEED A SOLUTION, I ARGUE \"WE JUST NEED ACKNOWLEDGMENT.\" IN THOSE CLIPS YOU PLAYED EARLIER, THE CONDESCENSION THAT HAS HALLMARKED THIS ADMINISTRATION WHICH ALSO HALLMARKS THE MOUTHPIECES OF THIS ADMINISTRATION IS EXHAUSTING, AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE AT THEIR KITCHEN TABLE STRETCHING BILLS AND FINANCES, WORRIED, CONCERNED, AND STRAINED ABOUT THE PRESENT AND THE FUTURE, THEY NEED ACKNOWLEDGMENT. WHEN THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK STATE SAYS \"I DON'T KNOW WHY THAT'S SO IMPORTANT TO YOU ABOUT CRIME, ABOUT TRIPLE DIGIT INCREASE OF VIOLENCE AND CRIME   ON THE STREETS --\" WHEN HE -- \"AMERICANS WHO VOTED REPUBLICAN AREN'T VERY BRIGHT.\" WE HAD JIMMY KIMMEL, WHO MOCKED THE PAIN AT THE PUMP AMERICANS FEEL AND SAID THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS ARE TUESDAY. ON ONE HAND \"OUR DEMOCRACY IS BEING THREATENED BY EXTREMISTS -- EVEN IF IT MEANS BURNING US TO THE GROUND. ON THE OTHER HAND, GAS IS $4 A GALLON.\" THE REPORTER TOOK A PHOTO OF GAS PRICES AND SAID \"WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?\" THE POINT IS THAT IT'S NOT FLYOVER COUNTRY. IT'S REAL AMERICAN THAT COUNT THEIR SENSE TO PUT THE GAS IN THE TRUCK, GET TO THEIR JOB IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY, AND THAT PAIN WAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED BY THIS ADMINISTRATION.  AS ONE VOTER SAID, YOU LIVE IN IVORY TOWERS AND THINK WE ARE STUPID. A FOX NEWS ALERT OUT OF ARIZONA. THE MARICOPA COUNTY ELECTIONS DIVISION SAYS 20% OF THE TABULATION MACHINES IN THE COUNTY ARE MALFUNCTIONING. THEY AREN'T COUNTING THE BALLOTS AT THE ELECTION SITE.

        "trs": " Dana: POLLS ARE OPEN IN NEW YORK WHERE VOTERS ARE CHOOSING THEIR GOVERNOR. RISING CRIME AND LIBERAL BAIL LAWS HAVE BECOME CENTRAL ISSUES IN THE RACE BETWEEN KATHY HOCHUL AND LEE ZELDIN. ALEXIS MCADAMS IS LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY. THIS HAS BEEN SURPRISINGLY CLOSE FOR KATHY HOCHUL. PEOPLE WHO SUPPORT LEE ZELDIN THINK HE HAS A REAL CHANCE.  THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. HE IS FIRED UP AND READY. HE THINKS THAT HE CAN WIN THIS RACE HERE FOR THE GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK, WHICH WOULD BE HISTORIC FOR HIM AS A REPUBLICAN. CRIME IS THE REASON IT'S SO CLOSE. IT IS NOT A SURPRISE IF YOU LIVE HERE. WE'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT IT. IN RECENT WEEKS HOCHUL'S LEAD HAS DISAPPEARED. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN NEW YORK SAY THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE. TALKING ABOUT THE POLLING LOCATIONS WE'RE AT LIVE WE'RE LIVE ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE. TAKE A LIVE LOOK AT THE HUNTER COLLEGE AREA WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING IN TO VOTE THIS MORNING. VOTERS ACROSS THE STATE TELL US EVERYTHING FROM THEIR SAFETY TO THE ECONOMY AND ABORTION RIGHTS ARE AT ISSUE THIS ELECTION. LISTEN.  GUNS, GUN VIOLENCE, STAFFING ISSUES FOR OUR HOSPITALS, BUT ALSO WELL, AS A WOMAN CERTAINLY ROE V. WADE.  DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL AND REPUBLICAN LEE ZELDIN ARE HITTING THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL HARD TO CONVINCE VOTERS THEY ARE THE BEST CHOICE. AS CRIME SURGES ACROSS THE CITY IT HAS BECOME THE TOP PRIORITY FOR VOTERS AND FOCUS FOR BOTH CANDIDATES. GOVERNOR HOCHUL SHIFTED HER FOCUS TO CRIME AND TOUTING HER RECORD ON TAKING ILLEGAL GUNS OFF THE STREETS SAYING NEW YORK IS ONE OF THE SAFEST CITIES IN THE COUNTRY.  MY OPPONENT IS WORKING SO HARD TO KEEP PEOPLE SCARED AND I'M WORKING SO HARD TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE.  CONGRESSMAN ZELDIN HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT CRIME SINCE DAY ONE AND WORKED TO TIE HOCHUL'S POLICIES TO THE RISE IN CRIME ACROSS NEW YORK TELLING VOTERS THE INCUMBENT IS JUST PRETENDING THE CITY IS SAFER THAN IT REALLY IS.  REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS HAVE HAD ENOUGH. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE GAS LIT OR LOOK AWAY. THEY WANT BOLDNESS AND COURAGE FROM THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO MAKE THE STREETS AND SUBWAYS SAFE AGAIN.  POLLS CLOSE TONIGHT AT 9:00 ACROSS NEW YORK. WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM BOTH CANDIDATES ON ELECTION DAY.  Dana: A PRETTY DAY TODAY.  Bill: I WANT TO SHOW SOME FOLKS ADVANCE EARLY VOTE. A BIG DEAL. I WAS POPPING AROUND A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT STATES. NOT CONCLUSIVE AT ALL. HERE IS WHAT I FIND. GEORGIA HAS HAD A VERY STRONG TURNOUT AMONG ADVANCE VOTING. SENATE AND GOVERNOR RACE AS WELL. EARLY IN PERSON VOTING 2.2 MILLION. FOR A TOTAL OF 2.5. ALMOST 36% OF THE TOTAL STATEWIDE VOTE. VERY IMPRESSIVE. THAT'S BETTER THAN THEY DID IN 2018. IT IS REAL CLOSE TO THE NUMBERS THEY DID IN THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE OF 2020. DOWN HERE IN FLORIDA KIND OF A SIMILAR STORY, RIGHT? 33%. A THIRD OF THE VOTE STATEWIDE IN FLORIDA CHOSE TO VOTE EARLY IN PERSON OR BY MAIL AS WELL. I WILL SHOW YOU A FEW OTHERS HERE. I FIND THIS INTERESTING BECAUSE SOME STATES DO IT THIS WAY AND OTHER STATES DO IT THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY. 30% NOW THE TOTAL VOTE IN NORTH CAROLINA. IF I COULD, I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY AND TRY TO POP OUT HERE TO NEVADA JUST WANT TO CLOSE THIS LOOP HERE. GOOD SENATE RACE THERE. GOOD GOVERNORS RACE THERE IN NEVADA. SO YOU ARE AT 30% IN NEVADA OF THE TOTAL VOTE IN. I WILL SHOW YOU ONE MORE. LET'S CLEAR THIS AND POP DOWN TO ARIZONA AND SEE WHAT WE GET. OKAY, MASTERS AND KELLY ON THE SENATE SIDE. YOU ARE ALMOST 35% IN ARIZONA AS WELL. GIVES YOU A BIT OF A SAMPLE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING TO VOTE. REMEMBER IT CAME THROUGH THE PANDEMIC IN 2020. IT BECAME MORE POPULAR. WE'LL SEE THE EFFECT ON PARTY TURNOUT. DEMOCRATS LIKE TO VOTE EARLY. REPUBLICANS NOT SO MUCH AND LIKE TO DO IT IN PERSON. SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE MARGINS CHANGE ON THAT AND MIGHT TELL US A VERY INTERESTING STORY.  Dana: JOIN US FOR MORE ON THIS IS JOSH. IF YOU ARE DONE LOOKING AT THE POLLS DOES THE EARLY VOTE TELL YOU ANYTHING?  WE NO LONGER IN MOST STATES HAVE AN ELECTION DAY, WE HAVE AN ELECTION WEEK OR MONTH IN SOME STATES. AS BILL WAS SAYING, IT IS BREAKING DOWN ALONG PARTISAN LINES IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE VOTE SO DEMOCRATS MOSTLY HAVE BEEN THE ONES TAKING THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE EARLY WHEREAS REPUBLICANS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. SO THAT HELPS SHOW US TO BE PATIENT ON ELECTION NIGHT. SOME STATES WILL REPORT THAT EARLY VOTE FIRST. SOME STATES WILL REPORT THE ELECTION NIGHT VOTE FIRST. WHAT DEMOCRATS, THEY LIKE THE TURNOUT NUMBERS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF VOTERS VOTING EARLY. WHAT THEY WORRY ABOUT, THOUGH, IS MAYBE SOME OF THOSE VOTERS THAT WOULD VOTE ON ELECTION DAY ARE VOTING EARLY. MAYBE THE TURNOUT MAYBE NOT QUITE AS GOOD AS WHAT THEY WERE HOPING.  Bill: WILL YOU WRITE A STORY THAT TALKS ABOUT REPUBLICANS VOTING EARLY? DO YOU THINK THERE COULD BE THIS FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT AFTER WHAT WE WENT THROUGH IN 2020 THAT IF YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IT COUNTS, YOU BETTER MAKE SURE IT GETS IN WHETHER IT'S ELECTION DAY OR PRIOR.  IN 2020 PRESIDENT TRUMP DISSUADED A LOT OF VOTERS FROM VOTING EARLY. WE DON'T HAVE THAT SAME PERHAPS REMINDER OR PRESSURE THIS YEAR. LOOK, I DO EXPECT A PARTISAN BREAKDOWN IN THE EARLY VOTE VERSUS THE DAY OF. I THINK THE EARLY VOTE WILL BE PREDOMINANTLY DEMOCRAT AND ELECTION DAY VOTE PROMINENTLY REPUBLICAN.  Dana: THE HOUSE IS LIKELY TO GO TO REPUBLICANS. THEY HAVE RUN GOOD RACES AND HAVE A LOT OF DIVERSE CANDIDATES AND WE'LL SEE THAT IN THE HOUSE. WHAT IS YOUR VIEW ON THE SENATE? WILL REPUBLICANS TAKE OVER THE MAJORITY?  SENATE WILL COME DOWN TO THE WIRE. YOU HAVE THREE STATES TO LOOK AT VERY CLOSELY. PENNSYLVANIA WITH DR. OZ AND JOHN FETTERMAN. GEORGIA WHICH A LOT OF REPUBLICANS I TALK TO THINK IT MIGHT GO TO A RUNOFF. WE MAY HAVE ANOTHER MONTH OF ELECTIONS TO TALK ABOUT IN GEORGIA. NEVADA. NEVADA I THINK REPUBLICANS ARE THE MOST CONFIDENT ABOUT THE NEVADA SENATE RACE. POLLING HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW THAT RACE TIGHT AND IT IS STILL WINNABLE FOR DEMOCRATS IN SENATOR CORTEZ MASTO. BLAKE MASTERS WITH LATE MOMENTUM IN THE CAMPAIGN IN ARIZONA. CLOSE RACES WHERE LOTS OF MONEY HAS BEEN POURED IN AND IT WILL COME DOWN TO THE WIRE.  Bill: I THINK THERE IS PROBABLY 1,000 STORY LINES THIS TIME TOMORROW, RIGHT?  ONE OF THE STORY LINES, THE BLUE STATES. STATES THAT NORMALLY WE DON'T TALK ABOUT ON ELECTION NIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE DEMOCRATIC. CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, OREGON. THESE GOVERNORS AND HOUSE RACES IN THE BATTLEGROUNDS WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT.  Dana: MAYBE EVEN COLORADO. I HAD TO MENTION IT.  Bill: WE COULD KEEP GOING.  Dana: WE'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.  Bill: A KEY DEMOGRAPHIC TO WATCH, SUBURBAN WOMEN. MARTHA MACCALLUM IS ON THAT COMING UP IN A MOMENT. GEARING UP FOR TONIGHT'S COVERAGE. BRETT RE BRET AND MARTHA WILL BEGIN AT 6:00 EASTERN TIME RIGHT AFTER DANA GETS OFF \"THE FIVE\" AND WE'LL HAVE IT FROM THERE UNTIL HOWEVER LONG IT TAKES HERE ON THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL.

DEMOCRATS CALLING OUT THE CAVALRY TO HELP BOOST NEW HAMPSHIRE SENATOR MAGGIE HASSAN IN HER HEATED RACE AGAINST RETIRED BRIGADIER GENERAL DON BOLDUC.  WHAT YOU DO ON NOVEMBER 8TH WON'T JUST AFFECT THE COURTS FOR THE FUTURE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, YOU'LL HELP DECIDE THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AS WELL.  COMPLETE THE MARCH AND MAKE SURE DEMOCRACY PREVAILS AND THAT OUR INCREDIBLE SENATOR, THE MOST AMAZING WOMAN, MAGGIE HASSAN, CONTINUES HER WORK.  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE SEND SENATOR HASSAN BACK TO WASHINGTON TO KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK THAT WE ARE DOING TOGETHER.  SAYS THE SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION. JOINING US NOW IS A REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE RETIRED BRIGADIER GENERAL DON BOLDUC. WHAT DID YOU DO, GENERAL? NOW YOU HAVE ALL THEIR SO-CALLED STARS OUT TO SAVE MAGGIE HASSAN. SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO WALK ALL OVER YOU WHEN THE DEMOCRATS GAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO YOUR CAMPAIGN SO YOU WOULD WIN.  THANK YOU, BRIAN, IT'S GREAT TO BE ON. PRISON LISTEN, CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR, RIGHT? THEY PLAYED IT WRONG. JUST LIKE THEY PLAYED THE ECONOMY WRONG OUT OF CONTROL SPENDING, OPEN BORDER, EVERYTHING THAT THEY DO IS A MISCALCULATION BECAUSE THEY DO IT FOR THEMSELVES. THEY DON'T DO IT FOR THE PEOPLE. AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN. TWO YEARS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, 85 -- 85 TOWN HALLS. YOU KNOW, WORKING FROM THE BOTTOM UP EVERY TOWN AND CITY. SHE HAS NOT BEEN OUT THERE DOING THE WORK. SHE BRINGS IN PEOPLE WHO VOTE WITH HER AND JOE BIDEN 100% OF THE TIME. THAT'S JUST SIGNALING THAT SHE IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THAT THE MISERY INDEX IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GET HIGH. WE HAVE A MORAL IMPERATIVE TO HELP GRANITE STATERS IN AMERICA SO THEY ARE NOT CHOOSING BETWEEN EATING AND HEATING.  Brian: HERE IS WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ABOUT YOU AND YOUR CANDIDACY AND WHAT IT WOULD MEAN IF YOU WENT TO THE SENATE. LISTEN.  MY OPPONENT IS THE MOST EXSTRATEGIC NOMINEE FOR THE U.S. SENATE IN MODERN NEW HAMPSHIRE HISTORY. IF YOU ARE RUNNING FOR OFFICE, YOU ARE RUNNING TO REPRESENT THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUT YOU ARE TRYING TO RIP THE RIGHTS AWAY FROM HALF OF THE POPU POPULATION? THAT JUST TELLS EVERYBODY WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MY OPPONENT. AN ELECTION DENIER WORKING TO CONCEAL HOW EXTREME HIS RECORD IS, ELIMINATING SOCIAL SECURITY, PRIVATIZING MEDICARE AND CUTTING IT BY OVER A TRILLION DOLLARS.  Brian: DO YOU WANT TO TAKE ON THAT CARTOONISH CHARACTERIZATION OF YOU.  SURE. I WOULD LOVE TO. FIRST, I HAVE SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, THE ABORTION ISSUE IS A STATE RIGHTS ISSUE. NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS A LAW. THE GOVERNOR, THE LEGISLATION THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE DECIDED THAT. SENATOR HASSAN DOESN'T REALIZE THIS IS NO LONGER A FEDERAL ISSUE. IT'S A STATE ISSUE. AND I SUPPORT THAT. I WILL NOT CUT SOCIAL SECURITY. I WILL INVEST IN SOCIAL SECURITY. I WILL PROTECT IT AND THE SAME THING WITH MEDICARE. SHE CONTINUES TO SPEND $40 MILLION ON LIES. AND THE GRANITE STATERS ARE AWARE OF THAT NOW. THAT'S WHY THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A HUGE SHIFT IN THE POLLS. 11 POINTS DOWN TO NOW 1 OR 2 POINTS A&E HEAD. SO, GRANITE STATERS UNDERSTAND THAT SHE IS NOT WORKING FOR THEM AND THAT WANTS INDICATIVE OF HER VOTE AND THE WAY SHE DOUBLED DOWN ON NOT EVEN DEFENDING HER RECORD.  Brian: GENERAL, YOU HAVE DONE ABOUT 80 PLUS TOWN HALLS SINCE YOU DECIDED TO GO ON THIS. IT WAS A DISTANCE RACE. NOW IT'S 1 POINT UNDECIDEDS SEEMED TO BE BREAKING YOUR ELECTION. WHAT DID YOU LEARN AFTER DOING THOSE TOWN HALLS AND LISTENING FROM THE GUY THAT STARTED TO THE GUY THAT FINISHED, WHAT DID YOU LEARN AFTER TALKING TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE FOR ALL THOSE MONTHS?  WELL, WHAT I LEARNED WAS TWO YEARS -- TWO YEARS AGO, YOU KNOW, WE DIDN'T HAVE THESE ECONOMIC ISSUES. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE HIGH INFLATION AND THE HIGH INTEREST RATES, THE HIGHEST CRIME. THE OPEN BORDERS, TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE THEM. IT'S REALLY UNBELIEVABLE. AND I HAVE -- I HAVE WITNESSED THAT ON THE GROUND WITH GRANITE STATERS AND I HAVE SEEN MY LIFE AND THEIR LIFE CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THESE BAD DECISIONS. AND I HAVE HELD THE HANDS OF MOMS AND DADS WONDERING HOW THEY ARE GOING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. HOW THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS BETWEEN HEATING AND EATING. THIS IS WHAT I LEARNED. I LEARNED THAT SENATOR HASSAN HAS NOT HELPED THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE NOR WILL SHE IF SHE IS REELECTED.  Brian: SHE DID NOT DO ONE TOWN HALL. DID A COUPLE OF ZOOM CALLS NOT EVEN GOING TO A DUNKIN' DONUT AND TALKING TO PEOPLE. WILL GENERAL DON BOLDUC NO MATTER HOW IT TURNS OUT EVERYBODY RESPECTS SOMEBODY WHO WORKS THAT HARD FOR THAT LONG.

FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR RAYMOND ARROYO. THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS LEANING INTO ONE BIG ISSUE. WHAT IS IT?  IT'S ABORTION FOR SOME REASON.  Laura: STILL?  EVEN THOUGH THE SUPREME COURT RETURNED THE ISSUE TO THE STATES DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TURN THIS INTO A NATIONAL CONCERN. THOUGH WHEN JOHN FETTERMAN SOUNDS OFF ON ABORTION LAURA I THINK HE MIGHT BE TRYING TO HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.  I RUN ON ROE V WADE. I CELEBRATE THE DEMISE OF ROE V WADE.  I'D LIKE TO SPIN THE WHEEL PAT.  Laura: WHAT IS HE DOING.  WHAT IS HE TRYING TO SAY LAURA.  Laura: WHY IS DOING THIS?  THEY'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT WEDGE ISSUE AND CAN WIN VOTES AND TO UNDERSCORE JUST HOW IMPORTANT DEMOCRATS CONSIDER ABORTION VICE-PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS RETURNED TO HOWARD UNIVERSITY FOR A BET SPECIAL WITH BLACK VOTERS TONIGHT.  ONE DOES NOT NEED TO ABANDON THEIR FAITH OR DEEPLY HELD BELIEFS TO AGREE THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE TELLING HER WHAT TO DO WITH HER BODY. WHEN PEOPLE START COMING FOR -- AT SOMEONE TO TAKE AWAY THEIR RIGHTS, WE'RE ALL VULNERABLE. IT WILL JUST BE A MINUTE BEFORE THEY COME FOR SOME OF YOUR RIGHTS. SO LET'S NOT LET THIS TRAIN LEAVE THE STATION.  LAURA IT WAS ALL ABORTION FROM BEGINNING TO END.  Laura: OH, MY GOD.  THIS IS THE BEST THING SHE HAS TO OFFER THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PURE RESEARCH, 81% OF BLACK AMERICANS CONSIDER VIOLENT CRIME THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THEY'RE FOCUSED ON. 76% IN A POLL FOUND THAT THEIR TOP CONCERN WAS INFLATION. THIS IS NOT EVEN IN THE TOP FIVE. BUT HERE SHE WAS PRIME TIME, ONE HOUR, DEVOTED TO ABORTION. AND S AND L APPARENTLY ALSO GOT THE MEMO. THEY ABANDONED LAUGHS THIS WEEKEND TO PUSH THIS ABORTION PSA.  GAS PRICES ARE UP AND FAMILIES ARE REALLY HURTING BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO MAGICALLY DISAPPEAR NO MATTER WHO YOU VOTE FOR BUT WHAT WILL KEEP DISAPPEARING IS SAFE ACCESS TO A, WOULD. I HOPE TO HELL EVERYONE VOTES BECAUSE, REMEMBER, WE ALL LOVE SOMEONE WHO'S HAD AN ABORTION.  Laura: OH, MY GOD, IT'S SO UNFUNNY, A A DEGREESIVELY UNIF YOUY. THEY DID DO A FUNNY COVID SKIT.  SHE TALKS ABOUT THINGS DISAPPEARING, WHAT'S DISAPPEARING IS THE AUDIENCE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TELLING JOKES. THIS ABOUT AS ENTERTAINING AS THAT NPR AUDIO ABORTION THEY PLAYED THE OTHER DAY, LAURA. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS DECIDED THIS IS GOING TO BE THEIR DELIVERANCE. THIS IS THEIR WEDGE ISSUE. IT DOESN'T WORK. BUT MY FAVORITE TACTIC FROM SOME OF THESE POLITICIANS IS WHEN CONFRONTED WITH REAL QUESTIONS, THEY JUST REVERT TO THE OLD, WHAT? OH, HUH? WHAT? DO YOU HEAR ANY -- I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING. CAN YOU HEAR SOMETHING? I DON'T.  SEE YOUR HANDLING OF THE PANDEMIC. WE ALL KNOW THE CRITICS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. DO YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS AND --  I'M SORRY. [BLEEP].  GO AHEAD GOVERNOR. CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY? YOU GOT ME GOVERNOR?  DID I DO THAT WHEN I TOUCHED THE EAR THING? IT WAS STARTING TO FALL OUT.  OH, NO, IT'S OKAY.  CAN'T HEAR YOU WATER RUNNING. REMEMBER THAT OLD -- IT'S THE SAME THING.  CONVENIENTLY WHISPERS AUDIO GOT LOCKED DOWN SO IT WAS PERFECT TIMING.  WHEN I TOUCHED IT IT WAS FALLING OUT. PUT IT BACK IN SWEETHEART. IS IT SO HARD TO FIGURE THAT OUT.  EXACTLY. SHE HAD ENOUGH TO CURSE ON AIR BUT COULDN'T RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ABOUT HER LOCKDOWN. THIS IS LIKE THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY TRYING TO SPIN BIDEN'S VOW TO CLOSE ALL POLL PLANTS LAURA A GREAT CLOSING ARGUMENT IN PENNSYLVANIA, BY THE WAY, HERE'S HOW THE PRESS SECRETARY EXPLAINED THINGS.  IT WAS LOUD AND HARD TO HEAR, I THINK, OR MAYBE NOT, EXACTLY WHAT, WHAT WAS BEING SAID. THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS WE BELIEVE WERE TWISTED.  HIS WORDS WERE TWISTED. THAT ARGUMENT IS WHAT'S TWISTED. A THIRD OF OUR COAL PLANTS, LAURA, ARE ALREADY CLOSED. HOW ARE WE GOING TO POWER OUR ELECTRICAL GRID BUILDING ALL THESE STATIONS.  Laura: WE TALKED ABOUT IT ON THE ANGLE THEY WANT TO GET RID OF DRILLING, COAL, THEY HATE CARS, THEY HATE FRACKING SO THAT LEAVES US WITH THE GAS BAGS IN WASHINGTON POWERING THE WHOLE COUNTRY. THAT'S IT.  LAURA, JUST SO YOU KNOW AND I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU WITH THIS, THE PRESIDENT IS CLOSING THIS ENTIRE MIDTERM SEASON BY DISPLAYING THE CAN I HAVE LEADERSHIP TONIGHT THAT YOU'D EXPECT, CONFIDENT, STEADY.  TWO, TEN, 12, 15, WHOOPS, STEPPING ON A -- THERE'S A -- THAT'S BLACK. ANYWAY. WE'RE GOING TO CODIFY ROE V WADE IN JANUARY AND MAKE IT THE RULE OF THE LAND.  JILL IS ALWAYS THERE POINTING THE WAY, LAURA. THEY NEVER SEND HIM TO AN EVENT WOUND A MINDER, OBAMA, JILL. BUT I LOVE THE MOMENT WHERE HE [MOBILS] IN THE CLOSING ARGUMENT. AT THAT WORKED WELL.  Laura: AGAIN, ELOCUTION IS COMING ANY DAY  IN MOMENTS WE TAKE YOU TO THE TWO STATES WHERE WE MIGHT SEE SOME BIG SURPRISES TOMORROW. SO STAY WITH US. 20221108034400.420|20221108034844.970",

        "trs": "\u266a  Laura: ONE STATE THAT THE ANGLE'S BEEN WATCHING FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS NOW WHERE WE COULD SEE A SURPRISE IS MICHIGAN WHERE REPUBLICAN TUTOR DIXON HAS MADE A LATE CHARGE AGAINST INCUMBENT GRETCHEN WHITMER, FOX NEWS NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT GARRETT TENNEY IS LIVE IN GRAND RAPIDS MICHIGAN WITH THE LATEST THERE. GARRETT, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US.  THIS RACE IS GOING TO BE A REALLY INTERESTING ONE TO WATCH. A LOT HAS CHANGED THE LAST MONTH FROM TUDOR DIXON TRAILING GRETCHEN WHITMER BY AS MUCH AS 18 POINTS IN THE POLLS TO NOW BEING BEHIND FOUR POINTS IN THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS AVERAGE AND DEMOCRATS ARE NOW SOUNDING THE ALARM AS WELL ABOUT LARGE NUMBERS OF BLACK VOTERS IN DEEP BLUE DETROIT WHO ARE EXPECTED TO STAY HOME THIS ELECTION. THE CITY CLERK SAYS BASED ON EARLY VOTING NUMBERS SO FAR SHE EXPECTS AROUND 39,000 FEWER VOTERS IN MOTOR CITY WILL CAST BALLOTS COMPARED TO 2018, WHICH WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE A HUGE BLOW TO WHITMER'S REELECTION HOPES. AND AT A RALLY IN DETROIT THIS WEEKEND SHE WAS ASKED HOW SHE'S TRYING TO OVERCOME THAT.  HAVING PEOPLE LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA COMING IN AND CARRIE WASHINGTON, WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IS A LOT OF ENERGY. WE'VE MADE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DEMOCRACY. BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO EDUCATE PEOPLE.  THAT ANSWER WASN'T CONVINCING TO A COLUMNIST FOR THE DETROIT NEWS. THOMAS, WHO IS BLACK AND WHO WROTE THIS OF DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES. THEY SEEM TO BELIEVE THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR STATE WIDE OFFICES HAVE NO CHANCE OF GETTING ELECTED BECAUSE THEY WERE ENDORSED BY FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT THINKING IS IF ENOUGH BLACK PEOPLE DON'T COME OUT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE DEMOCRATS ARE IN TROUBLE. THE OTHER THING WE'RE LOOKING AT TOMORROW NIGHT IS WHAT RESULTS LOOK LIKE IN THE SUBURBS, THAT'S WHERE DEMOCRATS WON THE STATE IN 2020 AND THAT IS WHERE REPUBLICANS NEED TO PERFORM WELL TOMORROW IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO PULL OFF THIS UPSET. LA YOU'RE?  Laura: GARRETT THANK YOU. GREAT TO SEE YOU TONIGHT. AND 40 YEARS, THAT'S HOW LONG IT'S BEEN SINCE OREGON ELECTED A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR. BUT THAT COULD ALL CHANGE TOMORROW NIGHT AND IT'S GOT EVEN GOOD MORNING AMERICA WORRIED.  THAT RACE IS SO UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAD TO BRING IN BERNIE SANDERS, ELIZABETH WARREN, PRESIDENT BIDEN TO STUMP FOR THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE TINA KOTEK. THIS IS A STATE THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WON BY 16 POINTS BUT SOARING INFLATION, CRIME, HOMELESSNESS HAVE BECOME THESE RED MEAT ISSUES TO WHICH THE DEMOCRATS SIMPLY DON'T HAVE AN EASY ANSWER.  Laura: AND VOTERS CAN SEE THAT WHICH IS WHY, IN A STATE THE DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THEY WOULD EASILY SWEEP, REPUBLICAN CHRISTINE DRAZEN IS TRAILING DEMOCRAT TINA KOTEK BY JUST FOUR POINTS. CHRISTINE DRAZEN JOINS ME NOW. I CAME ACROSS THIS STATISTIC AND IT SHOCKED ME AND I THOUGHT I HAD SEEN IT ALL BUT LAST YEAR MEXICO CITY HAD A LOWER HOMICIDE RATE PER CAPITA THAN PORTLAND OREGON? SO HOW DO VOTERS KEEP VALIDATING THAT TYPE OF LEADERSHIP IN THIS CLIMATE?  WELL, HERE'S THE THING. IT'S NOT UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE FOR OREGONIANS. OREGONIANS ARE REACHING CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. THERE IS NO UNIVERSE WHERE THE MURDER RATE IN PORTLAND SHOULD BE CLOSE TO THE MURDER RATE IN MEXICO CITY. AND OREGONIANS ARE DONE, THEY'RE DONE WITH IT, THEY'RE DONE WITH THE EXCUSES AND POOR LEADERSHIP AND SINGLE PARTY CONTROL. THERE IS NO AMOUNT OF SPIN THAT CAN COVER UP WHAT IT'S LIKE RIGHT NOW IN OUR URBAN CENTERS AND ACROSS OUR STATE. OREGONIANS DESERVE BETTER AND ARE DEMANDING BETTER.  Laura: EVERY TIME I LOOK AT SORT OF THE NEWS, YOU KNOW, CYCLE FOR OREGON NOW, IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH SOME HORRIFIC CRIMES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE.  YEAH.  Laura: LIKE THIS MORNING IT WAS A GUY WIELDING SOME TYPE OF WEAPON, I GUESS HE HAD A RIFLE TRYING TO SET FIRE TO MERCEDES. THE POLICE HAD TO SHOOT AT HIM TO TRY TO STOP THIS BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT EXPLOSIONS. THIS IS AT 8:52 IN THE MORNING.  YEAH.  Laura: AND YET YOU'VE LIST BETH WARREN OUT THERE MAKING A PITCH TO VOTERS FOR YOUR OPPONENT. WATCH THIS.  EVERYTHING IS ON THE LINE, OUR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, OUR HEALTHCARE, THE NEEDS OF WORKING FAMILIES AND OUR DEMOCRACY ITSELF. AND THAT IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO ELECT TINA KOTEK. PLEASE, GET THAT BALLOT IN, AND VOTE FOR TINA KOTEK FOR OREGON GOVERNOR. LET'S PET THIS DONE.  Laura: ABORTION AND DEMOCRACY. NO WONDER EASTERN OREGON WANTS TO SUS SEED TO IDAHO WITH THAT PITCH.  IT'S TONE DEAF. IT IS TONE DEAF. YOU HAVE TO BE COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUS TO WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN OREGON TO COME HERE AND MAKE A NATIONAL DC ELITE PITCH TO OREGON VOTERS RIGHT NOW IS COMPLETELY TONE DEAF. OREGONIANS ACROSS THE STATE ARE TALKING ABOUT KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES, THE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY AFFECT REAL PEOPLE. INFLATION, RISING COSTS, RISING CRIME, LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE ACROSS OUR STATE AND CERTAINLY EDUCATION STANDARDS THAT HAVE PLUMMETED UNDER DEMOCRAT LEADERSHIP. MY OPPONENT TINA KOTEK HAS BEEN IN CHARGE. SHE HAS LINKED ARMS WITH GOVERNOR KATE BROWN IN THESE LAST SIX YEARS AND HAS DRIVEN OUR BEAUTIFUL STATE, OUR GREAT STATE OF OREGON INTO THE DITCH AND OREGONIANS THEMSELVES RESIST DESERVING BETTER. THE FACT THAT GOOD MORNING AMERICA WOULD VIEW IT AS DANGEROUSLY CLOSE.  Laura: UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE.  OUR CHANCE TO TURN IT AROUND IS TOMORROW.  Laura: UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE. YES OR NO THAT BALLOT MEASURE PUSHING FOR STRICTER GUN CONTROL PASS? YES OR NO?  I SAY NO.  Laura: THAT'S THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND IN THE COUNTRY AND A VERY ODD RESPONSE TO THE CRIME RATE GOING UP IN YOUR STATE. CHRISTINE WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THIS CAMPAIGN YOU RAN AND WE'RE GOING TO BE WATCHING THIS RACE VERY CLOSELY TOMORROW NIGHT. BEST OF LUCK TO YOU. THANK YOU  JUST HOURS AWAY FROM THE POLLS OPENING, FINAL THOUGHTS ON THIS WILD LAST YEAR WHEN WE RETURN. \u266a 20221108035659.263|20221108035951.102",

IN ARIZONA AS MARK KELLY ARUNING AWAY FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN TO KEEP HIS SEAT BLUE OR TRY TO. WE START IN NEVADA WHERE CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO IS IN A TOUGH MATCH WITH ADAM LAXALT. THAT RACE IS CONSIDERED A TOSS-UP IN POWER RANKINGS. ALEXANDRIA HOFF IS IN ARIZONA TONIGHT. GOOD EVENING.  IT IS A TURNOUT GAME AT THIS POINT IN A HOPES OF LAST MINUTE BOOST. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG CAMPAIGNED ALONGSIDE INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO WHO IS ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE SENATE DEMOCRATS WHO HAS BEEN POLLING IN A STATISTICAL TIE WITH HER REPUBLICAN OPPONENT NEVADA'S FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL ADAM LAXALT. BILL CLINTON STUMPED FOR CORTEZ MASTO AS WELL AND PRESIDENT OBAMA DID SO ON TUESDAY PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS NOT VISITED THE STATE. GIVEN HIS LOW APPROVAL NUMBERS WE ASKED CORTEZ MASTO IF SHE HAD WANTED THE PRESIDENT TO CAMPAIGN HERE.  YOU KNOW WHAT? ANYBODY IS WELCOME TO COME IN, IN TO THIS STATE. THE FOCUS IS AS I SAID TURN OUT OUR VOTERS. MAKE SURE EVERYBODY EXERCISES THE RIGHT TO VOTE WHICH THEIR VOICE IN THIS COMMUNITY.  LAXALT HAS FOCUSED OTHERWISE CAMPAIGN ON THE ECONOMY AND CRIME AND HE SAID TODAY THAT HIS OPPONENT'S RECORD IS TIED TO THE PRESIDENT'S.  SHE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAND WITH NEVADA, TO TELL JOE BIDEN SHE WASN'T GOING TO SPEND MORE MONEY, BUT SHE CAST THAT VOTE JUST LIKE SHE HAS CAST EVERY OTHER VOTE WITH JOE BIDEN WHEN HE HAS NEEDED HER, ALL THESE THINGS HAVE ADDED UP TO MAKE NEVADA AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER ZONE.  NOW, SO FAR, JUST UNDER 640,000 EARLY VOTES HAVE BEEN CAST. THAT'S UP 100,000 FROM 2018. DEMOCRATS HAVE A 1.4 PERCENT ADVANTAGE THERE OVER REPUBLICANS. BUT NEVADA HAS OVER HALF A MILLION ACTIVE NONPARTISAN VOTERS AND THEY WILL LIKELY DECIDE THE OUTCOME OF THIS. NOW, AS FAR AS TURNOUT TOMORROW, WEATHER COULD PLAY AN IMPACT. IT IS VERY BLUSTERY RIGHT NOW. RAIN IS IN THE FORECAST TOMORROW FOR LAS VEGAS AND SNOW IN RENO WHERE WEATHER WILL NOT BE PLAYING A FACTOR DOWN SCIOTO IN ARIZONA THAT IS WHERE MY COLLEAGUE ALICIA ACUNA IS FOLLOWING THE RACES.  THANK YOU. IN FINAL PITCH TALKING TO VOTERS ABOUT THE ISSUE INFLATION AND THE BORDER CRISIS. INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MARK KELLY IS IN THE FIGHT OF HIS POLITICAL LIFE, OFTEN DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND ITS POLICIES.  LEGISLATION TO HELP BORDER BUSINESSES. I HAVE LEGISLATION TO PREVENT THE ADMINISTRATION FROM ENDING TITLE 42. AND I TELL THE PRESIDENT, YOU KNOW, WHEN IS HE WRONG AND HE IS ABOUT TO MAKE THIS CRISIS WORSE.  HIS OPPONENT, REPUBLICAN BLAKE MASTERS WANTS TO, QUOTE: MILITARIZE THE BORDER. AND ACCUSING DEMOCRATS OF WEAK APPROACHES TO THE PROBLEM.  IF YOU JUST THROAT BORDER WIDE OPEN, DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE A CRISIS? YES. THEY DID IT ON PURPOSE. NOT ONLY DID THEY TELL ILLEGAL ALIENS COME ON IN, WE ARE NOT GOING TO DEPORT YOU, THEY INCENTIVIZED PEOPLE TO BREAK THE LAW.  IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE, G.O.P. HOPEFUL KARI LAKE IS PUSHING BACK ON ACCUSATIONS SHE AND HER SUPPORTERS ARE TOO EXTREME. THIS AS DEMOCRAT KATIE HOBBS WHO IS ALSO ARIZONA'S CURRENT SECRETARY OF STATE HAS MADE ELECTION INTEGRITY CENTRAL TO HER MESSAGING.  WE HAVE BEEN RIGHT HERE SOLID CONSERVATIVES FOR A LONG TIME. WE HAVEN'T MOVED. GUESS WHO MOVED? THE DEMOCRATS. THEY MOVED FURTHER AND FURTHER AND FURTHER. THEY HAVE FALLEN OFF THE STAGE, OKAY?  I KNOW WE SAY EVERY ELECTION THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION IN OUR LIFETIME. THIS IS POSSIBLY THE LAST ELECTION IN OUR LIFETIME IF WE DON'T ELECT THE RIGHT PEOPLE.  AND AN INDICATION OF HOW HEATED THIS STATE IS, THE MARICOPA ELECTIONS DIVISION JUST WRAPPED A NEWS CONFERENCE ON, QUOTE:  PREDICTING FALSE ELECTION NARRATIVES, BRET?  Bret: ALICIA ACUNA LIVE IN PHOENIX, THANKS. UP NEXT WE GO DOWN TO GEORGIA FOR THE FINAL DAY OF CAMPAIGNING IN THAT CRUCIAL SENATE RACE. FIRST, BEYOND OUR BORDERS TONIGHT. NORTH KOREA'S MILITARY SAYS ITS RECENT BARRAGE OF MISSILE TESTS WERE PRACTICES TO MERCILESSLY STRIKE KEY SOUTH KOREAN AND U.S. TARGETS SUCH AS AIR BASES AND OPERATION COMMAND SYSTEMS WITH A VARIETY OF MISSILES THAT LIKELY INCLUDED NUCLEAR CAPABLE WEAPONS. NORTH KOREA FIRED DOZENS OF MISSILES AND FLEW WARPLANES TOWARD THE SEA LAST WEEK TRIGGERING EVACUATION ALERTS IN SOME SOUTH KOREAN AND JAPANESE AREAS. NORTH KOREA ALSO DENIED SELLING ARMS TO RUSSIA. THIS IS A LIVE LOOK AT LONDON, ONE OF THE BIG STORIES THERE TONIGHT, FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL MACRON MEETS WITH BRITISH PRIME MINISTER HISSY SUNAK ON THE SIDELINES OF THE CLIMATE CONFERENCE. THE LEADERS WERE EXPECTED TO DISCUSS SMALL BOAT CROSSINGS ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL IN A SURGE OF THE NUMBER OF ASYLUM SEEKERS ATTEMPTING TO REACH BRITAIN BY BOAT. JUST SOME OF THE OTHER STORIES BEYOND OUR BORDERS TONIGHT, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. \u266a  Bret: HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI IS TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE AND HER POTENTIAL ROLE IN THE NEXT CONGRESS. THE INTERVIEW IS THE SPEAKER'S FIRST SINCE HER HUSBAND WAS ATTACKED AT THE COUPLE'S SAN FRANCISCO HOME.  HAVE YOU MADE THE DECISION IN YOUR MIND, WHATEVER THAT DECISION MIGHT BE.  I HAVE TO SAY MY DECISION WILL BE AFFECTED BY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST WEEK OR TWO.  WILL YOUR DECISION BE IMPACTED BY THE ATTACK IN ANY WAY?  YES. PLEASE WOULD LOSE HER SPEAKERSHIP IF REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. REPUBLICANS ARE URGING THEIR VOTERS NOT TO LISTEN TO MEDIA PREDICTIONS OF A RED WAVE AND TO SHOW UP AT THE POLLS TOMORROW.  Bret: SENATE CANDIDATES SUPPORTERS ON THE LAST DAY OF CAMPAIGNING GET OUT THE VOTE. CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT AISHAH HASNIE IS IN MACON TONIGHT.  ARE YOU READY TO WIN THIS ELECTION?  IT'S THE FINAL SPRINT FOR THE REVEREND AND THE FOOTBALL STAR.  I'M GOING TO TELL ALL OF YOU TO VOTE FOR ME AND WE'LL ALL GET TO THE PROMISE LAND.  IN A RACE THAT COULD ONCE AGAIN DECIDE THE FATE OF THE U.S. SENATE. REPUBLICANS CHURNING OUT BIG NAMES AND TAKING THEIR FINAL SHOTS.  LEGAL IMMIGRANTS ARE POOR PATRIOTIC THAN THE LEFTISTS THESE DAYS. SO THE ONLY PERSON THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE DEPORT IS WARNOCK.  HERSCHEL WALKER IS DEMONSTRATING TO YOU WHAT KIND OF SENATOR HE WOULD BE BASED ON THE COMPANY HE IS KEEPING.  THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL HAS INCUMBENT SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK AND REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER HERSCHEL WALKER PRACTICALLY NECK IN NECK IF NEITHER GETS MORE THAN 50% OF THE VOTES, GEORGIA LAW SENDS THIS RACE TO A RUNOFF.  DON'T LISTEN TO THIS RED WAVE STUFF THEY ARE TALKING TO YOU ABOUT.  PRESSURE IS ON THE G.O.P. TO GET VOTERS TO THE POLLS AND PREVENT A REPEAT OF 2020 WHEN THE PEACH STATE HANDED DEMOCRATS THE SENATE. THIS TIME INFLATION IS THE TOP ISSUE WHICH DREW A RECORD 2.5 MILLION EARLY VOTERS. AND COULD HELP WALKER ON ELECTION DAY DESPITE ALLEGATIONS THAT HE FORCED TWO WOMEN TO GET AN ABORTION. HE DENIES IT.  THEY ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE ECONOMY BACK IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  EVEN IF HE IS NOT YOUR FAVORITE CANDIDATE.  YES.  WARNOCK SUPPORTERS SAY THIS RACE IS MORE OF A CHOICE BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG.  INFLATION COMES AND GOES THROUGHOUT ALL ADMINISTRATIONS. WE NEED TO SAVE AMERICA.  AND, BRET, TONIGHT WE ARE EXPECTING SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM TO JOIN HERSCHEL WALKER AT A RALLY TONIGHT. IN THE MEANTIME, TAKE NOTE OF THIS VERY INTERESTING SENATOR WARNOCK HAS NOT HAD A BIG POLITICAL HEADLINER A HEAVYWEIGHT ON THE TRAIL WITH HIM THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS EXCEPT FOR HIS SENATOR COLLEAGUE JON OSSOFF. BRET?  Bret: AISHAH HASNIE LIVE IN MACON. ANCHOR OF \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\" JOINS US TONIGHT SHANNON BREAM AND SHE IS GOING TO EXPLAIN THE FOX VOTER ANALYSIS SYSTEM WE WILL USE TOMORROW. GOOD EVENING, SHANNON.  Shannon: WE ARE EXCITED TO USE OUR NEW INNOVATIVE SURVEY APPROACH AGAIN THIS ELECTION. OUR FOX NEWS VOTER COMPUTER ANALYSIS NATIONAL SURVEY MORE THAN 100,000 VOTERS WITH REALTIME VOTE DATA SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHO VOTED AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WHY. BY INTERVIEWING VOTERS ON THEIR CELL PHONES, LAND LINES, STARTING WAY BACK ON OCTOBER 31st TO THE END OF ELECTION DAY THE FULL PROFILE OF AMERICAN VOTERS INCLUDING THE TENS OF MILLIONS WHO ARE NOW VOTING EARLY OR BY MAIL AND THEY WOULDN'T BE REPRESENTED IN TRADITIONAL IN PERSON EXIT POLLS. WE ASK WHO THEY INTEND TO SUPPORT TUESDAY AND HOW THEY ALREADY VOTED THAT \u266a ALL. WHY ARE THEY SUPPORTING A PARTICULAR CANDIDATE? WELL, FOR INSTANCE, IS INFLATION THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THEIR VOTING DECISION? IF SO, THAT COULD HELP REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. OR, IS THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE AND THE IMPACT ON ABORTION THE BIGGEST FACTOR? THAT PROBABLY HELPED DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES. WHAT MESSAGE DOES THE ELECTORATE WANT TO SEND PRESIDENT BIDEN IS THEIR VOTE EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR HIM OR OPPOSITION OR MAYBE IT WASN'T A FACTOR AT ALL. MAYBE MORE ABOUT THE ISSUES. ALSO GOING TO HAVE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS IN KEY RACES. FOR EXAMPLE, ASKING PENNSYLVANIA VOTERS HOW CONCERNED THEY ARE ABOUT JOHN FETTERMAN'S HEALTH VS. MEHMET OZ'S SO-CALLED CARPET BAGGER STATUS. OUR FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS SURVEY WILL TELL US ALL OF THAT AND MUCH MORE, BRET?  Bret: WE BOTH KNOW REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGNS ARE ALREADY LAWYERING UP I CAN SAY THAT FIVE TIMES. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE POTENTIAL FOR LEGAL CHALLENGES?  Shannon: LAST I HEARD FROM ONE SOURCE TRACKING THESE MORE THAN 100 CASES ALREADY FILED COUPLE IN KEY STATES TOO. IN PENNSYLVANIA THEY ARE FIGHTING ABOUT BALLOTS CAME IN DATED INCORRECTLY OR HAVE A PROBLEM WITH. THEY THE SUPREME COURT THERE IN PENNSYLVANIA TOLD THEM SET THOSE ASIDE AND DON'T COUNT THEM. THEY ARE STILL FIGHTING THOUGH OVER WHETHER VOTERS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE UP THE MISTAKES IT FOUND. IN GEORGIA, COBB COUNTY, ANOTHER CRITICAL SENATE RACE IN A CRITICAL PLACE THERE, COBB COUNTY A JUDGE HAS RULED THAT THEY ARE GOING TO EXTEND THE EXTENSION FOR AN ABSENTEE BALLOT TO COME IN BY NOVEMBER 14TH BECAUSE OVER 1,000 BALLOTS DID NOT GET MAILED OUT THERE TO PEOPLE WHO REQUESTED ABSENTEES SO THE LEGAL, YOU KNOW, STRATEGIES BACK AND FORTH HAS ALREADY STARTED I WOULD EXPECT AFTER WE GET THE VOTES DONE TOMORROW THERE WILL BE A WHOLE NEW SLEW OF LEGAL ACTION TO FOLLOW, BRET.  Bret: YES. ARE YOU READY?  Shannon: I AM READY FOR IT.  Bret: SEE YOU TOMORROW. UP NEXT THE PANEL ON THE FINAL DAY OF THE MIDTERM ELECTION CAMPAIGN. FIRST, HERE IS WHAT SOME OF OUR FOX AFFILIATES WITH COVERING TONIGHT. FOX 45 IN ATLANTA AS GEORGIA GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP DIRECTS ALL AVAILABLE STATE RESOURCES TO HELP LOCAL RESPONDERS DEAL WITH A CHEMICAL PLANT FIRE ON COLONEL'S ISLAND. AUTHORITIES ORDERED THE EVACUATION OF ABOUT 100 HOMES THERE. THE PLANT IS LOCATED 70 MILES SOUTH OF SAVANNA. ONE FIREFIGHTER WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL BUT THERE ARE NO OTHER REPORTS OF INJURIES. AND THIS IS A LIVE LOOK AT MINUTE MAID PARK IN HOUSTON FROM FOX 26. ONE OF THE BIG STORIES THERE TONIGHT, THE VICTORY PARADE FOR THE WORLD SERIES CHAMPION HOUSTON ASTROS, THE TEAM CLINCHED SECOND TITLE IN SIX YEARS BY CLOSING OUT THE PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES SATURDAY. SOME SCHOOLS CANCELED CLASSES SO STUDENTS COULD ATTEND THE CELEBRATION. CONGRATULATIONS. THAT'S TONIGHT'S LIVE LOOK OUTSIDE THE BELTWAY FROM \"SPECIAL REPORT.\" WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. \u266a \u266a 20221107234109.732|20221107234308.901",

        "trs": " \u266a OVER THE LINE \u266a \u266a OH \u266a  Jesse: BAD NEWS, AMERICA. ACCORDING TO TOP DEMOCRATS, DEMOCRACY IS GOING TO DIE TOMORROW IN THE LAST FREE AND FAIR ELECTION EVER.  ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTIONS OF OUR LIFETIME. IT'S GOING TO SHAPE THE OUTCOME IS GOING TO SHAPE OUR COUNTRY FOR DECADES TO COME, AND THE POWER TO SHAPE THAT OUTCOME IS IN YOUR HANDS.  WHEN TRUE DEMOCRACY GOES AWAY, PEOPLE GET HURT. IT HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES. THIS IS NOT AN ABSTRACTION. GOVERNMENTS START TELLING YOU WHAT BOOKS YOU CAN READ AND WHICH ONES YOU CAN'T. DISSIDENTS START GETTING LOCKED UP. REPORTERS START GETTING LOCKED UP IF THEY'RE NOT TOWING THE PARTY LINE. CORRUPTION REIGNS BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY.  Jesse: AMERICA'S 200-YEAR-OLD DEMOCRACY IS GOING TO DIE IF REPUBLICANS WIN. THE SAME COUNTRY THAT SURVIVED A CIVIL WAR, GREAT DEPRESSION, TWO WORLD WARS AND WILL SMITH'S OSCAR SLAP. BEST PART IS THE WAY IT'S GOING TO END IS BY PEOPLE VOTING. IF THAT'S NOT DIRE ENOUGH, THIRD MOST POWERFUL DEMOCRAT IN THE HOUSE DOUBLED DOWN IN HIS COMPARISON OF THE REPUBLICANS TO HITLER.  DEMOCRACY WILL BE ENDED. THE WORLD WILL CONTINUE TO EXIST. THE WORLD WAS HERE BEFORE HITLER. THE WORLD WAS HERE AFTER HITLER. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING. NO, THE WORLD WILL NOT END. THE KIND OF WORLD WE HAVE. THE KIND OF COUNTRY THAT WE HAVE. WE'VE GOT TO DECIDE HOW DO WE WANT TO EXIST IN THIS WORLD? AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.  Jesse: IF YOU THOUGHT THAT WAS RIDICULOUS, HOLLYWOOD LIBES LIKE ROB REINER THINKS REPUBLICANS WILL LITERALLY START KILLING PEOPLE.  OTHER SIDE REALITY DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING. THEY'RE ONLY INTERESTED IN POWER. AND THEY ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN -- AND THEY'LL DO ANYTHING TO GET THE POWER. THEY'RE WILLING TO KILL. LITERALLY KILL TO GET THE POWER. YOU CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THEM. THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS TRY TO HOLD ON TO THE HOUSE, ADD A COUPLE OF SENATE SEATS. IT WILL BE VERY HARD. IF WE DON'T DO THAT, THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST ELECTION WE HAVE IN A DEMOCRATIC DEMOCRACY -- IN A DEMOCRACY.  Jesse: SO GREG GUTFELD, IF DEMOCRACY IS GOING TO DIE ON WEDNESDAY, SHOULD YOU BE WEARING A HAWAIIAN SHIRT ON MONDAY?  Greg: IT'S WEIRD BEING CALLED HITLER BY SOMEBODY WHO LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO A PRESENTATION FOR A TIME SHARE. IT'S SOMETHING ELSE. BUT I DON'T KNOW, DOES IT MATTER IF THE PERSON CALLING YOU HITLER OR SAYING YOU'RE LIKE A NAZI DOESN'T MEAN IT? IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING. I GO BACK TO THE WHOLE THING WHEN KAMALA HARRIS BASICALLY CALLED BIDEN A RACIST. AFTERWARDS WHEN THEY ASKED HER ABOUT IT, SHE'S LIKE IT'S JUST A DEBATE. SHE BEGAN LAUGHING. I'M GOING OK, IS THAT WORSE? I MEAN, YOU'RE STILL CALLING SOMEBODY A BIGOT OR YOU'RE STILL CALLING SOMEBODY A RACIST. THEY THINK THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION, WE FORGET ABOUT ALL OF THIS. BUT I THINK WE HIT THE WALL. I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE. I REALLY THINK WE'VE HIT THE WALL. WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING TO CALL US BEYOND NAZI? IN 10 YEARS, NAZI IS GOING TO BE MILD. IT'S LIKE THAT'S INSULTING TO HITLER.  Jesse: I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.  Greg: THAT'S HOW IT'S GOING. IT'S CRAZY!  Jesse: ARE WE GOING TO PLAY THIS TAPE OF ROB REINER SAYING THE REPUBLICANS ARE LITERALLY GOING TO KILL PEOPLE AND TURN INTO NAZI GERMANY? I THINK WE'LL HEAR A LOT OF THAT FOOTAGE FOR ABOUT THE NEXT YEAR.  Dana: YOU WANT TO WATCH IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN? REMEMBER THE STATISTICS THAT JUDGE JEANINE POINTED OUT IN THE A BLOCK, 60% OF PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR DRASTIC CHANGE. THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY IS ALL ABOUT. YOU BROUGHT UP THE POINT THAT DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE. PEOPLE ARE SAYING WE'D LIKE SOME CHANGE. THE OTHER THING IS LET'S GET SOME PERSPECTIVE ON HISTORY. THE WHITE HOUSE KNEW ON JANUARY 20, 2021, THEY WERE LIKELY TO LOSE THE HOUSE AND MAYBE THE SENATE IN THIS MIDTERM ELECTION. SO THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. SO IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. IT'S NOT THE END OF DEMOCRACY. IT'S KIND OF PREPOSTEROUS AND INSULTING.  Jesse: REJECT YOUR PARTY'S MIDTERM MESSAGE. YOU HAVE 20 SECONDS, GO!  Jessica: I HAPPENED TO BE PARTICULARLY 1930'S SENSITIVE SINCE MY FAMILY ACTUALLY DID FLEE HITLER AND IT WAS KIND OF A BIG DEAL. AND I DON'T LIKE THOSE COMPARISONS. K.K.K. OUT, DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT, HITLER, DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT DENOMINATIONS OF FASCISM, IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT FRANKLY FROM THE OTHER SIDE, DENOMINATIONS OF SOCIALISM. I KNOW HAROLD BROUGHT UP THIS POINT YESTERDAY. THE RIGHT OFTEN FLINGS AT THE LEFT AND SAYS IF THEY GET INTO POWER, IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE VENEZUELA. YOU'RE GOING TO BE EATING DOGS, RIGHT? AND ALL YOU'LL HAVE IS -- Jesse: CHEF BOYARDEE.  Jessica: THAT'S BETTER THAN DOG.  Jesse: IS IT?  Jessica: THAT'S MY MIDTERM MESSAGE.  Jesse: NOT EATING DOG FOOD!  Jessica: IT'S VERY SAD THAT EVERYONE HAS BECOME SO IMMUNE TO THE HORRIFIC THINGS THAT THE OTHER SIDE IS SAYING TO THEM. AND I HAPPENED TO THINK THAT THERE ARE REALLY SERIOUS REPUBLICAN THREATS TO DEMOCRACY IN TERMS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE SAID I WOULD NOT HAVE CERTIFIED THE ELECTION. I WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE IN NEW YORK WHO IS GOING TO VOTE TOMORROW, A DEMOCRAT, WHO IS THINKING ABOUT LEE ZELDIN AND SHE SAID MAKE YOUR CASE. AND I TALKED ABOUT WHY I VOTED FOR HER AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE DEMOCRATS IN CHARGE. AND HE SAID BESIDES -- HE CAME OUT WITH AN AD ABOUT ABORTION WHICH I THINK WAS SMART OF HIM TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE LAWS AREN'T GOING TO CHANGE. I SAID I COULD NOT VOTE FOR SOMEONE WHO VOTED AGAINST CERTIFYING A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION. PERIOD, END OF STORY FOR ME. AND I THINK PEOPLE LIKE DOUG MASTORONI AND OTHERS ARE DANGEROUS. GOING TO THE EXTREMES IN EVERYTHING TURNS EVERYBODY OFF AND THEY GO INTO THAT BOOTH AND THEY DO SOMETHING AND THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. THEY DON'T WANT TO RESPOND TO POLLS. REPUBLICANS 28 POINTS LESS LIKELY THAN DEMOCRATS TO TELL POLLSTERS WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO ON ELECTION DAY. AND TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, LOWERING THE TEMPERATURE. THIS IS ONE WAY THAT WE CAN DO IT WHERE AT LEAST VOTERS WILL FEEL LIKE YOU'VE HEARD THEM SAY TALK TO ME ABOUT STUFF I ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT AND THAT CAN BE TALKING ABOUT JANUARY 6TH IN A NORMAL WAY OR IT CAN BE TALKING ABOUT WHAT MEDICARE FOR ALL WOULD MEAN IN A NORMAL WAY.  Greg: YOU KNOW WHO ELSE SAID THAT, JESSICA? STALIN.  Jessica: THAT'S NOT TRUE.  Greg: CHECK IT.  Jessica: I WILL DURING THE BREAK. I DON'T THINK IT IS.  Jeanine: THEY SAY DEMOCRACY WILL DIE IF THE DEMOCRATS DON'T WIN TOMORROW. WHAT THE DEMOCRATS WANT IS ONE PARTY RULE. WHAT THE DEMOCRATS WANT IS FOR REPUBLICANS TO NEVER WIN AGAIN. WHAT THE DEMOCRATS WANT IS TO DESPISE THE 74 MILLION AMERICANS WHO VOTED MAGA OR VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. THEY HATE OTHER AMERICANS THAT LIVE WITH THEM IN THE SAME COUNTRY. MY BELIEF IS THIS. IF REPUBLICANS DON'T WIN, LAW AND ORDER WILL CONTINUE TO BE OUT OF CONTROL BECAUSE OF THE DEMOCRAT POLICIES THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING ESPECIALLY IN NEW YORK STATE. IF THE REPUBLICANS DON'T WIN, IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE END OF FREE SPEECH AS WE SAW WITH BIG TECH AND THE ELECTION IN 2020 WHEN THEY WOULDN'T ALLOW US TO EVEN TALK ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN. IF THE REPUBLICANS DON'T WIN, THEN IT WILL BE A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY BECAUSE IT WILL BE THE END OF EDUCATION WHERE TEACHERS BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT WITHOUT US KNOWING ABOUT IT. FINALLY, THEY WANT ONE PARTY RULE WHICH IS EVIDENCED BY THEIR REPEATED DEGRADATION OF ANYBODY THAT'S NOT A DEMOCRAT. THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE. WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR ONE PARTY RULE.  Jessica: WHAT DEMOCRAT DO YOU WANT IN CHARGE? TELL ME! WHAT DEMOCRAT DO YOU LIKE?  Jeanine: LET ME FINISH. JOE BIDEN IS THE PRESIDENT. SO THAT'S NOT ONE PARTY RULE.  Jessica: WOULD YOU LIKE HIM TO WIN?  Jeanine: I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS. RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS A DEMOCRAT. AND MOST AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT THE POWERS SHOULD BE SPLIT BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. WHAT THE DEMOCRATS WANT IS THEY WANT A DEMOCRAT HOUSE, SENATE AND OVAL. AND THAT'S BROUGHT US NOTHING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.  Jesse: YOU KNOW WHAT DEMOCRAT I LIKE? YOU, JESSICA.  Jessica: WHAT?  Greg: AHHH!  Jessica: I'LL COUNT ON YOUR VOTE.  Jesse: UP NEXT, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NOTHING LEFT TO RUN ON. NOW THEY'RE INSULTING MILLIONS OF VOTERS AS STUPID. 20221107222333.612|20221107222746.797",

        "trs": " Martha: SO MORE THAN 30 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY CAST THEIR VOTES IN THE MID TERPS. WITH HOURS TO GO AND CONTROL OF CONGRESS HALLING IN THE BALANCE, SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT COMPLETELY MADE UP THEIR MINDS AND WILL VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. WE WANT TO CHECK IN WITH THREE OF THEM. BERNADETTE, KIMBERLY AND DORIE. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. DORIE, LET'S START WITH YOU. WE JUST SPOKE WITH ADAM LAXALT, THE FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL. WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE TO YOU? WHEN YOU ARE UNDECIDED AND YOU WALK IN, WHAT IS TUGGING AT YOU?  I'M HONESTLY SURPRISED SO MANY PEOPLE ARE DECIDED. I'M LOOKING TO HEAR THE POST COVID WORLD CONVERSATION ABOUT SYSTEMIC HEALTH IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING ON AND HOPING SOMEONE MENTIONED BEFORE I DECIDE.  Martha: I KNOW THAT YOU TOLD US THAT YOU'RE A REGISTERED DEMOCRAT VOTER. YOUR HUSBAND IS A REPUBLICAN VOTER GENERALLY, I GUESS. SO WHAT -- SO OBVIOUSLY YOU HOME SCHOOL YOUR KIDS, I THINK YOU SAID AS WELL, POST COVID. SO IS NEITHER ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES GIVING YOU A SENSE OF WHAT KIND OF WORLD YOU WANT TO SEE POST COVID?  ABSOLUTELY NOT. I DON'T THINK ANYONE IS SPEAKING TO BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS FOR EVERYONE, WHICH IS WHAT I THINK WE ALL ARE WAITING TO HEAR.  Martha: IS IT EDUCATION YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT?  EDUCATION IS IMPORTANCE. BUT HEALTHY VOTING SYSTEMS AND BIPARTISAN, NOT ISSUE FOCUSED BUT SOLUTION FOCUSED. I DON'T HEAR A LOT OF LANGUAGE THAT IS THAT WAY.  Martha: ARE YOU LEANING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AS WE TALK?  I THINK I'M GOING TO -- I'M LEANING TO KEEPING BALANCE. SO WHETHER I VOTE FOR ADAM LAXALT, IT'S BECAUSE I THINK THE SYSTEM REQUIRES BALANCE. I WOULD PREFER TO HEAR BOTH PARTIES SPEAKING ABOUT SYSTEM HEALTH.  Martha: DO YOU FEEL SPLITTING YOUR VOTE AT THE GOVERNOR LEVEL AND THE SENATE LEVEL?  I DO. I DO SEE MYSELF SPLITTING THE VOTE.  Martha: VERY INTERESTING. BERNADETTE, LET'S GO TO YOU IN GEORGIA. THAT IS COMING DOWN TO THE WIRE. WHICH WHY ARE YOU GOING AND WHY?  FIRST, THANKS FOR HAVING US. I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I'M LEANING TOWARDS KEMP. I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT AND PRAYING ABOUT IT. I FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A PERSON TO CHANGE THINGS. THERE'S ALL OF THIS POLITICAL RHETORIC THAT IS OUT THERE RIGHT NOW. I NEED SOMEONE THAT STANDS FOR SOMETHING AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING. ECONOMY IS A BIG THING AND INFLATION IS A BIG THING. AS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, WE UNDERSTAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS EMPLOY PEOPLE ESPECIALLY HERE IN GEORGIA. THE ONLY PERSON THAT IS TALKING ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW IS KEMP. THERE'S LOTS OF THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT HIM. THERE'S SOME THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT HER. I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE HAVE THE BEST CHOICE. IF I HAD TO MAKE A CHOICE, IT WOULD BE FOR KEMP?  WHAT ABOUT AT THE SENATE LEVEL WITH WALKER AND WARNOCK?  MY VOTE IS STILL FOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK. I FEEL LIKE HE CAN REACH ACROSS THE AISLE AND TALK TO PEOPLE. HE KNOW WHAT'S THE HE'S DOING ALREADY.  Martha: SO EACH OF YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SPLITTING YOUR TICKET. ONE REPUBLICAN VOTE, ONE DEMOCRATIC VOTE IN GEORGIA AND THE NEVADA, WHICH IS FASCINATING. KIMBERLY, LET'S GO TO YOU IN OHIO. WE HAVE A BILLBOARD THAT IS A TIM RYAN BILLBOARD THAT IS IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. WE'LL PUT THAT UP ON THE SCREEN. IT WAS A SUBJECT OF ONE OF THEIR DEBATES. FOLKS CAN READ IT. THERE'S SOME INTERESTING PHOTOS AND IMAGES ON THERE. YOU CAN SEE THAT EVERY DAY. HOW ARE YOU LOOKING AT THIS BETWEEN J.D. VANCE RIGHT NOW AND TIM RYAN? WHICH WAY ARE YOU GOING TO GO?  ACTUALLY UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE NOT MADE A DEFINITION DECISION. J.D. VANCE SCARES ME. IN THE BEGINNING, HE WAS NOT A SUPPORTER OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. NOW HE IS. I THINK IT'S ONLY BECAUSE TRUMP CAME OUT TO ENDORSE HIM. SO TRUMP PICKED HIM UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL AND GOT HIM TO THE TOP OF THE PLAYING FIELD. NOW, TIM RYAN HAS BEEN IN THE HOUSE FOR TEN YEARS. WE KNOW THAT HE'S EXPERIENCED. THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE WITH TIM RYAN IS THAT HE'S A TOUGH TALKER. I DON'T NEED A TOUGH TALKER. I NEED A TOUGH DOER. SO WITH ALL OF THE TOUGH TALK, WE STILL HAVE NOT SEEN CONCRETE EVIDENCE ABOUT WHAT HE CAN BRING TO THE TABLE. SO WHAT CONCERNS ME, OF COURSE, IS INFLATION. THE HIGH GAS PRICES. YOU KNOW, THE DOLLAR IS DECREASING AND PRICES ARE RISING. I HAVEN'T HEARD EITHER WANT DID IT TALK ABOUT WHAT POLICIES OF INFLATION THAT THEY WOULD SUPPORT IN ORDER TO MAKE AMERICANS COMFORT THE WAY WE SHOULD BE, NUMBER 1. NUMBER 2, I'M STILL CONCERNED ABOUT THE REVERSE OF ROE V. WADE. J.D. VANCE WAS ON A PODCAST CALLED CATHOLIC CURRENT. HE MADE A COMMENT THAT COMPARED ABORTION TO SLAVERY. I NEED TO GET CLARIFICATION ABOUT WHAT DID HE MEAN. BECAUSE IF HE UNDERSTOOD THE HISTORY OF SLAVES, HE KNEW THAT A LOT OF SLAVES WERE RAPED. SO IS HE SAYING THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE RAPED THAT THEIR OPTIONS OF AN ABORTION IS NULL AND VOID? I NEED CLARIFICATION. I NEED TOO ANSWER WHAT HAPPENED JANUARY 6. WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND THE INSURRECTION. HOW DO YOU SUPPORT A CANDIDATE WHO CRIED ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE DIDN'T WIN AND ALL HECK BROKE LOOSE AT THE WHITE HOUSE? I'M ON THE FENCE. BECAUSE I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHOEVER GETS THAT SEAT IS GOING TO BE DOWN FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND NOT JUST FOR SOMEBODY'S POLITICAL PARTY.  Martha: KIMBERLY, I HOPE WHEN YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND, LET US KNOW. WE WOULD LOVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU END UP DECIDING. KIMBERLY, BERNADETTE, DORIE, THANKS. GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. SO \"HE'S GOING TO WIN THE RACE.\" THAT IS FROM CRIST CHRISTIE WHO IS PREDICTING A COME FROM BEHIND VICTORY IN COLORADO WHERE REPUBLICAN JOE O'DEA IS BATTLING IT OUT TO UNSEAT TWO-TERM INCUMBENT MICHAEL BENNETT.  I THINK TUESDAY NIGHT IS JOE O O'DEA WILL BEAT MICHAEL BENNETT. THAT WILL BE A HUGE SURPRISE.  Martha: HE JOINS US LIVE NOR A QUICK CHAT AFTER THIS. 20221107203915.385|20221107204125.547",

        "trs": " Dana: VOTERS IN WISCONSIN SAY THEY'RE FEELING THE PINCH FROM HIGHER PRICES ON EVERYDAY ITEMS. MANDELA BARNES SAYS GROCERY STORES AND GAS STATIONS ARE USING INFLATION AS AN EXCUSE FOR PRICE HIKES. INCUMBENT RON JOHNSON. WE ARE LIVE IN MADISON, WISCONSIN WITH THE LATEST ON THIS RACE. HI, GRADY.  HI, DANA. REPUBLICAN SENATOR RON JOHNSON BRINGS UP INFLATION AT EVERY CAMPAIGN EVENT. HIS OPPONENT PROGRESSIVE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR MANDELA BARNES ON THE OTHER HAND DOESN'T TALK ABOUT IT NEARLY AS MUCH. IT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IN SOME CATEGORIES LIKE FOOD AND GAS, PRICES HAVE GONE UP MORE HERE IN WISCONSIN COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. RIGHT NOW A GALLON OF GAS IS A LITTLE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. IRONICALLY IN THE LARGEST CITY IN AMERICA'S DAIRY LAND, MILWAUKEE, A GALLON OF MILK COSTS $0.85 MORE THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. WHEN BARNES DOES TALK ABOUT INFLATION, HE SAYS IT IS GREED ING CORPORATIONS THE BLAME.  GAS COMPANIES, OIL AND GAS EXECUTIVES ARE MAKING RECORD PROFITS. RISING COSTS AT THE GROCERY STORES. WE NEED LEADERS WHO WILL STAND UP AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE INSTEAD OF THE WORKING PEOPLE INSTEAD OF STANDING SIDE-BY-SIDE THE FOLKS USING INFLATION AS A SMOKE SCREEN TO JACK UP PRICES ON US.  JOHNSON BLAMES INFLATION ON DEMOCRATS' POLICIES. I ASKED SENATOR JOHNSON ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA'S COMMENTS THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS, QUOTE, REPAIRED THE ECONOMY.  HE ACTUALLY SAID THAT? HE THINKS TAKING INFLATION FROM 1.4% TO 8.2%, TAKING GAS FROM $2.39 RIGHT NOW IN WISCONSIN $4 A GALLON, HE THINKS THAT'S HEALING OUR ECONOMY? THESE GUYS ARE AS DETACHED FROM REALITY AS THEY ARE FROM THE TRUTH.  ABORTION IS ANOTHER TOP ISSUE IN THE BADGER STATE BUT NOT EVERYBODY SEES THAT AS QUITE AS IMPORTANT AS INFLATION. IN FACT, EVERY SINGLE VOTER WE TALKED TO, DANA, YOUNG, OLD, DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN SAY THEY ARE FEELING THE PINCH FROM HIGHER PRICES.  Dana: IT'S THEIR REALITY. THEY LIVE IT EVERY DAY. THANK YOU.  Bill: A TIGHT SENATE RACE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. A RAZOR THIN MARGIN BETWEEN THE INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT MAGGIE HASSAN AND REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER DON BOLDUC. CHRIS SUNUNU IS WITH ME NOW WHO IS ALSO UP FOR RE-ELECTION.  I'M DOING GREAT, MAN. I'M IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND POLITICS IS OUR FIFTH PROFESSIONAL SPORT. TOMORROW IS A BIG DAY FOR US AND WE'RE EXCITED.  WILL YOU WIN RE-ELECTION, YES OR NO?  I HOPE SO. POLLS LOOK PRETTY GOOD. I THINK THE CAKE IS BAKED ON A LOT OF THESE RACES AT THIS POINT. ASKING FOLKS TO GET OUT THE VOTE AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THAT SUPPORT US DO AND SEE WHERE THE CHIPS FALL.  Bill: MAGGIE HASSAN HIT 50% THE OTHER DAY. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT RACE, GOVERNOR?  IT'S GOING TO BE A CLOSE ONE. GENERAL BOLDUC WILL PULL IT OUT. I HAVE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. I THINK IT WILL A LATE DECIDED RACE. SOME OF THE LARGER MORE CONSERVATIVE TOWNS LIKE SALEM THOSE WON'T COME IN UNTIL 2:00 OR 3 IN THE MORNING. IT WILL BE CLOSE BUT NO DOUBT THE GENERAL WILL PULL IT OUT. PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED WITH WASHINGTON. YOU CAN'T ASK FOR A CHANGE IF YOU DON'T CHANGE THE PEOPLE. FOLKS GET THAT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.  Bill: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE CAMPAIGN HE HAS RUN?  I TELL YOU WHAT, A VERY UNIQUE CAMPAIGN. YOU HAVE A GENERAL BOLDUC WHO TOLD MITCH MCCONNELL TO GO POUND SAND AND BEHOLDING TO NOBODY. DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THE MONEY BUT ABOUT REPRESENTING THE STATE. SOMETHING AMAZINGLY REFRESHING ABOUT THAT. A UNIQUE CAMPAIGN IN THAT SENSE. A VERY UNIQUE INDIVIDUAL. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S WHAT AMERICA IS LOOKING FOR, A CHANGE, SOMEONE WHO WILL SOLELY GO FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE'S INTEREST AND SOLEY WORK FOR THE INTEREST OF THE STATE AND BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE TODAY.  Bill: HE HAS TAKEN TO THE LONG-TIME STRATEGY OF DOING TOWN HALLS. PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE ARE DRAWN IT TO. WE'LL SEE WHETHER OR NOT IT WORKS FOR HIM. TWO CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. ONE IN THE SOUTHEASTERN CORNER OF THE STATE. NEW HAMPSHIRE ONE. CAROLYN LEAVITT IS 25 YEARS OLD WORKED IN THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE AND TRYING TO TAKE DOWN THE DEMOCRAT. HOW DO YOU SEE THAT RACE BREAKING? CAN THE REPUBLICAN WIN OR NOT?  CAROLYN WILL WIN BY 2 1/2, 3%. I THINK IT WILL BE CALLED EARLY. I THINK THE OTHER CD2. TRADITIONALLY MORE A DEMOCRAT PART OF THE STATE WILL BE AMAZINGLY CLOSE BETWEEN BURNS AND CUSTER. HE IS PART OF THE WOKE SOCIALIST AOC-TYPE BENT. YOU CAN'T KEEP SIGNED -- SENDING THE SAME PEOPLE BACK. CAROLINE IS VERY POSITIVE, ENERGETIC AND ENGAGES WITH FOLKS AND DRIVES ON THE ISSUES. CANDIDATES SHOULD NOT BE RUNNING ON WHAT THEY WANT TO RUN ON. THEY NEED TO RUN ON WHAT PEOPLE ARE FEELING, THE EMPATHETIC CONNECTION YOU MAKE WITH THE ACTUAL VOTERS AND WHERE REPUBLICANS HAVE DIFFERENTIATED THEMSELVES THAN DEMOCRATS. WE TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT MATTER TO INDIVIDUAL. DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING ABOUT ISSUES THAT MATTER TO BIG GOVERNMENT.  Bill: IF SHE WINS BY 2 1/2 POINTS IT IS A BLOW-OUT. DEMOCRATS MEDDLED IN THESE PRIMARIES. DOES IT WORK FOR THEM?  OH, CLEARLY NOT. TRUST ME, THE FACT THAT DEMOCRATS WERE TRYING TO PROP UP DON BOLDUC IN THE PRIMARY, CAN YOU IMAGINE GIVING MONEY TO THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, FINDING OUT THEY SPENT MILLIONS ON PROPPING UP DON BOLDUC IN THE PRIMARY AND NOW HE WILL BE THE U.S. SENATOR? IT IS BAFFLING. THE STRATEGY DIDN'T WORK. ANYONE WHO GAVE MONEY TO THE DEMOCRAT PARTY SHOULD BE RETHINKING BECAUSE AGAIN THEY ARE TRYING TO MEDDLE EACH WAY AND CHICKENS WILL COME HOME TO ROOST AS THEY SAY.  Bill: YOU MENTIONED SALEM AND ANOTHER TOWN.  SALEM AND DAIRY. LARGER TOWNS IN THE SOUTHERN TIER, MORE CONSERVATIVE. THEY ARE BIG AND COME HOME STRONG FOR DON BOLDUC LATE IN THE NIGHT.  Bill: I LOOK FOR CLUES TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR STATE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WE'LL SEE HOW IT TURNS OUT. THANK YOU.  I THINK OUR INFLATION IS GOING TO INCREASE WITH MARK KELLY.  I THINK MARK KELLY IS MORE MODERATE AND HE WILL HEAR MORE PEOPLE.  Dana: ARIZONA VOTERS SOUNDING OFF ON THE KEY SENATE RACE THERE. KELLY AND MASTERS ARE LOCKED IN A TITLE BATTLE THERE.

WE'RE EXCITED TO USE THE NEW INNOVATIVE SURVEY APPROACH AGAIN IN ELECTION. VOTER ANALYSIS IS A MASSIVE SURVEY. 100,000 VOTERS WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO WITH REALTIME VOTER DATA TO UNDERSTAND WHO VOTED AND WHY. BY INTERVIEWING VOTERS STARTING OCTOBER 31ST THROUGH THE END OF VOTING ON ELECTION DAY IT PROVIDES A FULL PROFILE OF AMERICAN VOTERS INCLUDING THE TENS OF MILLIONS WHO VOTE EARLY OR BY MAIL AND WHO MAY NOT BE REPRESENTED IN TRADITIONAL IN-PERSON EXIT POLLS. WE'LL ASK WHO THEY INTEND TO SUPPORT TUESDAY OR WHO YOU THEY ALREADY VOTED. THAT'S NOT ALL. WHY ARE THEY SUPPORTING A PARTICULAR CANDIDATE? WE HAVE GOT SOME INTERESTING DATA TO DIG INTO. IS INFLATION THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THEIR VOTING DECISION? IF SO IT COULD HELP REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. LET'S CHECK HERE ON ANOTHER HOT ISSUE. IS THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE AND THE IMPACT ON ABORTION THE BIGGEST FACTOR? THAT WILL HELP DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES. ALSO A WHOLE LOT OF ATTENTION OF WHAT IS BEING TAUGHT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. WE'LL LOOK HOW VOTERS FEEL OVERALL ABOUT THESE ISSUES AS WELL AS WHAT MOMS AND DADS HAVE TO SAY AND THEY HAVE A LOT TO SAY. OF COURSE, WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT VOTERS ARE PRIORITIZING. IS THE TOP ISSUE IN THE COUNTRY. IS IT ECONOMY, ABORTION, IMMIGRATION, CRIME, AND WHO WAS ABLE TO SWAY ALL OF THOSE LATE DECIDERS. OUR NEW SURVEY WILL TELL US THAT AND A LOT MORE. BACK TO YOU.

WHILE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS NOT ON THE BALLOT HE WAS MAKING A FINAL PITCH OVER THE WEEKEND HOPING TO WARD OFF DEFEAT FOR HIS PARTY WITH HOPES FOR HIS AGENDA HANGING IN THE BALANCE. MARC THIESSEN SUMMED UP BIDEN'S BIGGEST CHALLENGE.  IT WILL BE A RED HURRICANE. JOE BIDEN HAS THE EXACT WRONG MESSAGE. I KNOW THAT YOU SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IS INFLATION, GAS PRICES, FOOD PRICES, CRIME. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE IS DEMOCRACY. HE IS ALL OVER THE MAP IN TERMS OF THESE MESSAGES.

GOOD MORNING \"FOX & FRIENDS.\" IT WAS LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE IN THE ENTIRE HOTEL.  Brian: THIS IS WHY ALL THE ANCHORS DON'T LIVE TOGETHER IN ONE HOUSE BECAUSE WE HAVE DIFFERENT SCHEDULES. WHEN WE DO THEY GET DISRUPTED.  Ainsley: THEY ALL LOVE YOU. SIGNING UP FOR THE SHOW THEY WANTED TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU, YOU DIDN'T GET ANY SLEEP LAST NIGHT. TOMORROW IS ELECTION DAY BIG TIME FOR YOU.  Ainsley: THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.  Sean: THANK YOU GUYS. [APPLAUSE]  Brian: ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST. WE DISCUSS THIS ON SATURDAY A LITTLE. IT'S OVERWHELMING. ECONOMY MATTERS MOST TO THE OVERWHELMING AMOUNT OF REPUBLICANS BUT DEMOCRATS DON'T SEEM TO BE ADDRESSING IT.  Sean: LISTEN, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT, RECORD HIGH INFLATION, 41-YEAR HIGH. RECORD HIGH GAS PRICES, DON'T YOU WISH YOU HAD $2 A GALLON GASOLINE AGAIN?  YEAH.  Sean: INFLATION, 41% ON AVERAGE THAT WORKS OUT TO ABOUT $7,200 ANNUALLY PER HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA. IT IS KILLING THE POOR. IT IS KILLING THE MIDDLE CLASS, IT IS KILLING PEOPLE ON FIXED INCOME. THEN YOU HAVE GOT WIDE OPEN BORDERS. FOUR AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE. ANYBODY HERE HAPPY WITH THAT ILLEGALLY ENTERING OUR COUNTRY?  Ainsley: NO.  Sean: WE SHOULD HAVE LAW AND ORDER, THAT'S THE NEXT THING.  Ainsley: CRIME.  Sean: DEFUND, DISMANTLE, NO BAIL LAWS ARE MAKING EVERY CITY DANGEROUS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND THEN THEY DEFEND IT. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, THEY THOUGHT ABORTION WAS GOING TO BE THEIR BIG ISSUE UNTIL WE FOUND OUT OH, WE CAN HAVE ABORTION UP UNTIL THE MOMENT BEFORE BIRTH. THAT IS OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND LASTLY, PARENTS, I WOULD ASK YOU, WOULD YOU PREFER CRT, GENDER IDENTITY OR READING, WRITE, MATH, SCIENCE, HISTORY AND COMPUTERS? IS IT HARD? THAT'S WHAT'S ON THE BALLOT. I WILL TELL YOU THIS. WE DISCUSSED THIS ON SATURDAY NIGHT. IF YOU LOOK, GO BACK TO 2016, DONALD TRUMP WON THREE SWING STATES BY A WHOPPING 77,000 VOTES COMBINED. IN 2020, JOE BIDEN, WHAT WAS IT ARIZONA, GEORGIA AND WISCONSIN, 43,000 VOTES. IF YOU LOOK AT NEW HAMPSHIRE, IF YOU LOOK AT GEORGIA, IF YOU LOOK AT NORTH CAROLINA, IF YOU LOOK AT OHIO, NEVADA, AND ARIZONA, BETWEEN THOSE STATES, IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE DECIDED THE POWER IN THE SENATE BY LESS THAN 100,000 VOTES. SO, FOR PEOPLE, SIMPLE MATH HERE. EVERYBODY HAS GOT TO BE ON BOARD. IT'S ALL HANDS ON DECK BECAUSE YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE COUNTRY.  Ainsley: ISN'T THAT CRAZY TO KNOW THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT FETTERMAN, LOOK AT HIS POLICIES. HE IS SO RADICAL. YET, IS HE NECK IN NECK WITH DR. OZ THAT SHOWS YOU HOW DIVIDED OUR COUNTRY IS.  Sean: I HAVE NEVER SEEN AN ADVOCATE THAT ADVOCATES FOR RELEASE MORE CONVICTED MURDERS, WANTS AT LEAST A THIRD OF THE PRISONS OPENED UP.  Steve: HE HAS CORNERED THE MARKETS.  HE HAS WORN HALLOWEEN COSTUMES EVERY YEAR NEVER ONE TIME WORKED A REAL JOB IN HIS LIFE. WE HAVE ALL WORKED REAL JOBS IN OUR LIFE. I CALL HIM A TRUST FUND BRAT IN A HOODY.  IT'S A COSTUME E HAS NEVER HAD A REAL JOB. LIVED OFF MOMMY AND DADDY. GOT HOME FROM HIS SISTER FOR A DOLLAR. I WISH I HAD THAT DEAL. BUT, THE SAD PART IS THEN YOU LOOK AT HIS RADDISM. HEROIN INJECTION SITES, SAFE ONES FOR THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA. THE TAXPAYERS PAY FOR IT. MORATORIUM ON FRACKING. NO RESTRICTIONS ON ABORTION.  Steve: NO DOUBT THAT'S WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED TO VOTE. THAT'S WHY THE EARLY VOTING NUMBERS ARE THROUGH THE ROOF. THAT'S WHY OUR LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE HAS QUESTIONS RIGHT OVER THERE ON THE WALL SIDE. STEVEN, WHERE IS STEVEN? GIVE A WAVE. ALL RIGHT. STEVEN, WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION FOR SEAN HANNITY.  Sean: HEY, STEVEN.  GOOD MORNING, MR. HANNITY. DO YOU THINK 2024 GOVERNOR ANTIOXIDANT WILL GOING TO RUN AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP AND END THEIR BROMANCE?  Sean: PRESIDENT TRUMP LAST NIGHT ENDORSED A BIT ENTHUSIASTICALLY RON DESANTIS. LISTEN, CAN WE PLEASE GET THROUGH 2022? [LAUGHTER] WE GOT AN ELECTION TOMORROW. I THINK THAT WILL SORT IT OUT. I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL DECIDE. I WILL SAY THIS:  DONALD TRUMP'S POLICIES WORK. THEY WORK PHENOMENALLY WELL. OUR BORDER WAS SECURE. WE WERE ENERGY INDEPENDENT, WE WERE NET EXPORTER OF ENERGY. PRIOR TO COVID, WE HAD RECORD LOW AFTER RECORD LOW UNEMPLOYMENT, THE WORLD RESPECTED THIS COUNTRY. AND I THINK THAT THOSE POLICIES WORK. IF WE IMPLEMENT THOSE POLICIES AGAIN, WE'LL BE SUCCESSFUL AGAIN.  Brian: TOM COTTON SAYS HE IS OUT. DONALD TRUMP SOUNDS LIKE HE IS READY TO SAY HE IS. IN LET'S GO TO CHRIS IN THE SECOND ROW. CHRIS?  THANK YOU, SEAN. THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING TODAY AND FOR, YOU KNOW, SPEAKING WITH US AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE FOR THE PAST YEARS YOU HAVE BEEN IN MEDIA. SO, WE LOST RUSH LIMBAUGH ABOUT A COUPLE YEARS AGO, ACTUALLY, HE PASSED THE SAME WAY MY FATHER PASSED LUNG CANCER. BUT, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS ONE THING THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED FROM RUSH LIMBAUGH THAT HAS HELPED YOU IN YOUR CAREER?  BOY, THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. ONE THING THAT RUSH ALWAYS DID, HE WOULD READ EVERYTHING. AND THEN HE WOULD ABSORB IT AND THEN HE WOULD BREAK IT DOWN INTO THE MOST UNDERSTANDABLE CONCEPTS SO EVERYBODY GOT IT. LIKE WE CAN READ NATIONAL REVIEW AND THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" AND GIVE YOU FACTS AND FIGURES, BUT HOW DOES IT IMPACT YOUR LIFE? AND HE HAD THIS CONNECTION WITH PEOPLE, YOU CAN'T REPLACE THE GOAT. YOU CAN'T -- HE IS THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME. AND WHEN I SAID AT THE TIME AND I WILL REPEAT IT NOW IS THAT WE ALL HAVE TO STEP UP AND DO THAT MUCH MORE. AND WE HAVE GOT TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING HERE. ONE SIDE IS GOING TO WIN ON TUESDAY AND ONE SIDE IS GOING TO LOSE. I CANNOT TELL YOU WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY THAT BOLDUC IS GOING TO WIN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE OR THAT HERSCHEL WILL WIN IN GEORGIA OR THAT OZ WILL WIN IN PENNSYLVANIA OR JOHNSON WILL WIN IN WISCONSIN OR THAT MASTERS IN ARIZONA. TSHIBAKA IN ALASKA. TIFFANY SMILEY IN WASHINGTON OR LAXALT IN NEVADA. IT'S GOING TO BE THE PEOPLE IN THOSE STATES THAT DECIDE; HOWEVER, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE SCREWED THINGS UP SO BAD, THERE IS NOT ONE POSITIVE THING THEY CAN RUN ON. AND CONSERVATIVE IDEAS WORK. MAYBE YOU DIDN'T LIKE DONALD TRUMP'S TWEETS. BUT I LOVED HIS ECONOMY. I LOVED RECORD LOW GAS PRICES. I LOVE SECURE BORDERS. I LOVE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. I LOVE THE FACT I THINK VLADIMIR PUTIN FEARED HIM. I THINK PRESIDENT XI FEARED HIM. AND WE WERE MUCH STRONGER COUNTRY.  Brian: IF YOU LIKE RUSH, THERE IS A GREAT BOOK OUT THAT RUSH BASICALLY WROTE PUT TOGETHER BY LIMB. UNBELIEVABLE GREAT REMINDER.  Sean: YOU KNOW BRIAN IS IN RADIO NOW.

        "trs": "[APPLAUSE] \u266a STEVE LOOK AT THIS. LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE FOR THE DAY BEFORE THE MIDTERMS. MEANWHILE PRESIDENT BIDEN SKIPPING BATTLEGROUND STATES YESTERDAY AND TODAY TO CAMPAIGN FOR DEMOCRATS IN MARYLAND. A DEEP BLUE STATE.  JOINING US NOW OUR MIDTERM POLITICAL PANEL FOX NEWS CHINTER SEAN DUFFY, TAMMY BRUCE AND BRIAN BRENBERG. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]  Ainsley: TAMMY, IS HE GOING TO BE IN MARYLAND AND DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE IN OHIO. DOES THIS MAKE A DIFFERENCE?  IT DOES. LOOK, THEY CAN'T HIDE HIM IN THE BASEMENT THEY ARE MOVING HIM EFFECTIVELY INTO THAT STATE WHERE THERE WILL BE NO SURPRISES. A MACHINE THERE COMPLETELY PROTECT HIM. ALL OF THAT STILL SEEMS TO GO WRONG THOUGH. YOU ARE LOOKING AT WITH DONALD TRUMP A MUCH MORE FOCUSED, MUCH MORE INTENTIONAL INDIVIDUAL AT THIS POINT AS HE ALWAYS WAS WITH CONSIDER HIM LIKE A MASCOT FOR THE DEMOCRATS. HE COMES OUT AND I HOPE THEY DON'T PUT ONE OF THOSE RABBIT HEADS ON HIM AT AT ANY POINT. THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR THE DEMOCRATS. BY THE WAY THIS AUDIENCE LOOKS SO FREAKIN' GREAT. IT'S GREAT TO SEE THE FAMILY. [APPLAUSE]  THIS IS ABOUT AMERICAN FAMILIES. I THINK THAT IS WHAT DONALD TRUMP REPRESENTS. YOU KNOW, REACH OUT TO THAT A LOT MORE. BUT, YOU KNOW, THE DEMOCRATS ARE DESPERATE. WE SEE THAT IN HOW THEY ARE DEPLOYING BIDEN. AND AT THE SAME TIME AT THE START OF THIS I WANTED TO MENTION WHEN OBAMA DESTROYED THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN 2010, WHEN THAT WASHOUT OF HAPPENED THAT WAS THEIR PEP BENCH. HE DIDN'T CARE. AND THAT'S NOW WHY HE HAS TO COME BACK. BUT IT'S THE PAST. WE WANT THE FUTURE. WE KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. THE PAST WITH DONALD TRUMP, THE FUTURE, I THINK, IS GOING TO BE DONALD TRUMP AS WELL.  Brian: NUMBER ONE THING IS THE ECONOMY. YET, THE DEMOCRATS MYSTERIOUSLY. I MEAN IT MYSTERIOUSLY KEEP FOCUSING ON ABORTION. THAT'S YOUR THING.  I DON'T THINK IT'S MYSTERIOUS WHEN YOU HAVE A TRACK RECORD THEY HAVE. BUT IT IS FASCINATING TO ME THAT THEY NEVER FIGURED OUT ANYTHING ON THE MESSAGE. YOU TALK TO AN AUDIENCE LIKE THIS AND YOU SAY WHAT'S THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE YOU HAVE GOT IN YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW? IT'S PRICES, IT'S FUEL. AND THEN IT'S CRIME, QUALITY OF LIFE. THAT DRIVES BUSINESSES AWAY AS WELL. SO, DEMOCRATS HAVE GOTTEN THE MESSAGING WRONG THE WHOLE TIME. NOW THEY ARE WALKING INTO THIS ELECTION SAYING WE HAVE NO CLOSING ARGUMENT AND WE CAN'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF THE ELECTORATE RIGHT NOW. WHICH IS ECONOMY AND INFLATION.  Steve: AND YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE A BIG RED WAVE? THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND, IN PARTICULAR, \"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE.\" LOOK AT THIS.  IT'S TUESDAY OUR MIDTERM ELECTIONS WILL DETERMINE THE FATE OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND LET'S JUST SAY BIG YIKES. [LAUGHTER] WHAT'S GOING ON? I GUESS THE DEMOCRATS' MESSAGE AIN'T GETTING THROUGH SOME PEOPLE OVER HERE TALKING TO PEOPLE I'M ON THE PELOTON EVERY MORNING TEMPTING FATE.  Steve: IF THEY'RE JOKING ABOUT IT, SEAN, THEY KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A RED DAY TOMORROW. HISTORICALLY, THE OPPOSITION PARTY OF THE PRESIDENT IN THE MIDTERM ALWAYS WINS HISTORICALLY. THE QUESTION FOR TOMORROW IS HOW BIG?  HISTORICALLY THAT'S RIGHT. WE HAVE BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS. THE WIN IS THAT MUCH BIGGER FOR THE OUT OF POWER PARTY. THIS SET-UP IS RIPE FOR A RED WAVE. BUT, AGAIN, THE CLOSING MESSAGE ON THE ECONOMY IS I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT INFLATION, I KNOW YOU CARE ABOUT GAS PRICE, I KNOW WHAT WE SHOULD DO, LET'S STOP MINING FOR COAL AND DRILLING FOR OIL. THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THINGS A LOT BETTER, RIGHT?  Brian: THAT'S WHY IT'S SUCH A BIG MISTAKE HE MADE. IS HE SAYING IN A CANDID MOMENT AS IF HE HAD SODIUM PENTOTHAL I HAVE STOPPED DRILLING. I HAVE STOPPED EVERYTHING. AND THE POINT IS YOU WANT TO DO NO HARM TO YOUR PARTY. THAT'S WHY YOU SEND THEM TO MARYLAND. HE GOES TO MARYLAND AND MAKES THESE DUMB COMMENTS AND THEY RICOCHET THROUGH THE TV SCREENS OF AMERICANS GO THESE GUYS ARE OUT OF TOUCH THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND. YOU DIDN'T GET THESE PEOPLE COFFEE THIS MORNING, BRIAN. COME ON.  Steve: THANKS FOR THROWING US UNDER THE BUS. SEAN DUFFY MAKING HIS FINAL APPEARANCE.  Ainsley: ORDER CHICK-FIL-A FOR EVERYONE, TOO? [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]  YEAH.  I WILL STICK AROUND FOR THAT.  Steve: WE HAVE A LIVE AUDIENCE TODAY. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE QUESTIONS FOR THIS TRIO RIGHT HERE. FIRST QUESTION COMES TO US FROM THAT SIDE LONDA. WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION AND WHO IS IT FOR?  ANYONE, WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL TAKE BACK CONGRESS REALISTICALLY?  Brian: SENATE, THE HOUSE LOOKS PRETTY STRONG.  THE HOUSE IS 100 PERCENT. REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO WIN THE HOUSE. HOW BIG IS THE MAJORITY GOING TO BE? AND THAT MATTERS BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOT TO HAVE A MAJORITY THAT CAN YOU RULE WITH. RIGHT? BECAUSE.  Brian: FIVE SEATS TO MAKE UP.  REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. SENATE IS AN ISSUE. I THINK THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO WIN AT LEAST 51. SOME PROJECTIONS SAY 54% MAJORITY. THAT IS A BLOODBATH FOR DEMOCRATS.  COOK POLITICAL REPORT, I THINK THEY ARE GETTING THIS RIGHT. THEY UNDER THE NUMBER OF SEATS COULD BE BETWEEN 12 AND 25 IN THE HOUSE.  THAT'S LOW.  AND SOME ARE SAYING TWO INDEPENDENTS IN THE SENATE. BUT THEY -- THE REPUBLICANS WOULD STILL HAVE THE MAJORITY. SO THE MIX COULD BE INTERESTING AND DIFFERENT BUT WE'LL SEE. BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SENATE, TOO.  Brian: GO OUT TO STEVEN, STEVEN, WHERE ARE YOU? YOU ARE IN THE SECOND ROW THERE ALL RIGHT. STEVEN, GO AHEAD.  THE POLLING THAT WE SEE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE. IS ANY OF IT REALISTIC? WHICH ONES CAN WE BELIEVE?  Brian: WE WILL FIND THAT OUT.  I THINK THE MAIN THING YOU CAN LOOK AT WITH POLLS ARE THE BIG MOVEMENTS, THE BIG SHIFTS, THE BIG NUMBERS. WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT THESE SMALL NUMBERS BETWEEN YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL WHAT'S GOING ON. HILLARY WAS LEADING IN 2016. WHAT YOU SAW IN THE FOX NEWS POLL AS AN EXAMPLE IS WITHIN THAT LAST WEEK FOR TRUMP INDEPENDENTS HAD MOVED BY DOUBLE DIGITS. THAT'S WHEN I KNEW HE WOULD WIN. EVEN THOUGH THE TOP NUMBER HAD HER AHEAD. YOU LOOK AT CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY, WHERE THE INDEPENDENTS ARE GOING. WHAT HAPPENED WITH LEE ZELDIN MOVING DOUBLE DIGITS WITHIN A TWO MONTH PERIOD OF TIME. THOSE BIG MOVEMENTS YOU CAN TRUST.  LOOK AT THE TREND LINE. THE TREND LINE IS TOWARDS REPUBLICANS. ALSO LOOK AT 2018, 2020, AND I THINK THE THIS CYCLE, REPUBLICANS ARE UNDER POLLED. DEMOCRATS OVERPOLLED. IT 2 TO 5 POINT. FACTOR THAT IN AND LOOKS LIKE GREAT FOR REPUBLICANS. OPROFESSOR LET'S GET A QUESTION FOR ROBERT M. ROBERT, WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION?  WELL, THE ELECTION I HOPE TURNS OUT THE WAY IT SHOULD AND THAT WOULD BE LIKE WITH A G.O.P. MAJORITY BUT, IF THAT HAPPENS, LIKE WHAT ARE WE TALKING WITH, YOU KNOW, AS FAR AS THE ECONOMY, INFLATION, AND MANDATE AND THE BIG THING IS LIKE THE MANDATES. WHAT CAN WE SEE HAPPEN BEFORE THE '24 ELECTION. CAN WE SEE REAL CHANGE?  CAN I JUMP IN ON THIS ONE? BECAUSE THIS IS A KEY. YOU LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET DIVIDED GOVERNMENT. THE BEST PART ABOUT DIVIDED GOVERNMENT IS NOT VERY MUCH HAPPENS. AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST THING.  Steve: GRIDLOCK.  ENERGY HAS TO BE THE ISSUE. IF REPUBLICANS TAKE THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE THEY SHOULD BE HAMMERING THAT ISSUE AND I WOULD SAY THAT ISSUE ALONE EVERY DAY DAY AFTER DAY BECAUSE THAT'S THE BIGGEST CONTRAST BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND IF YOU WANT TO SOLVE INFLATION, THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN YOU CAN DO THAN GET OIL PRODUCTION, GAS PRODUCTION UP, UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY. BECAUSE IT'S WORLD LEADING IF WE LET IT DO THAT.  Ainsley: BRIAN, WOULD THE PRESIDENT VETO ANYTHING THAT THE REPUBLICANS WANT?  YEAH. PUT HIM ON RECORD. THIS IS A LONGER PLAY.  Brian: LEVERAGE. YOU WANT THE SENATE AND ANYONE NOMINATION CONFIRMED. DO YOU MY ENERGY PLAN. BUT, ALSO, THERE IS A CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW ACT. THE HOUSE, IF IT'S REPUBLICAN AND THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, THEY CAN GO BACK AND LOOK AT ADMINISTRATION ACTION AND PULL THOSE BACK WITH JUST A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE IN BOTH CHAMBERS. THAT'S A BIG DEAL IF YOU HAVE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY.  Brian: CONGRESSMAN ON THE PANEL.  HOW ABOUT A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR THIS PANEL. [APPLAUSE] COMING UP ON THIS MONDAY PUTTING MIDTERM ELECTIONS TO THE CHANCE WIN $25,000.  Ainsley: THIS TIME TOM SHILLUE IS ASKING THE QUESTIONS AND HERE HE COMES.

        "trs": "HOWARD: -- BIDEN USED A PRIME TIME SPEECH NOT TO TALK ABOUT KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES, BUT A TALK HE'S HIT MANY TIMES BEFORE, AND WHILE SOME PUNDITS PRAISED THE ADDRESS, OTHERS SAID THE PERFORMANCE WAS WAY OFF KEY.  YOU KNOW, AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS UNDER ATTACK BECAUSE THE DEFEATED FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES REFUSES TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE 2020 ELECTION.  PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SPEECH TONIGHT THE SAYING THAT DEMOCRACY IS ON THE BALLOT STRUCK A NEW NOTE FOR HIM, A NEW NOTE OF REALISM.  THAT'S THE CLOSING ARGUMENT NOW FOR THE DEMOCRATS, MEGA-MAGA REPUBLICANS ARE EVIL, AND EVERY DAY IS JANUARY 6TH.  IT'S HARD TO SAY TO THEM, YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD BE WORRYING ABOUT DEMOCRACY THAN GAS PRICES.  WHEN VOTERS ARE PAYING RECORD HIGH PRICES, SOME DEMOCRATS ARE QUESTIONING WHETHER THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON THE ECONOMY INSTEAD IN HIS CLOSING ARGUMENT.  BIDEN PROCEEDS TO DO WHAT HE NOW SO COMMONLY DOES, BARK AT THE REST ARE OF US FOR THE REST ARE OF OUR MORAL FAILURES. HOWARD: BIDEN'S A MADE A VERSION OF THESE REMARKS MANY TIMES, AND MOST DEMOCRATS WANTED HIM TO TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY OR INFLATION OR CRIME. NOW, THE ADDRESS BEGAN AT A HIGH-MINDED APPEAL TO RESERVE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY BUT VERY QUICKLY BECAME A BLATANTLY PARTISAN SPEECH. AN ATTACK ON DONALD TRUMP AND MAGA REPUBLICANS WHO ARE TRYING TO. SUPPRESS VOTING RIGHTS AND CONDONING POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND THREATENING THE FAIRNESS OF THIS ELECTION. NOT MUCH OF A STRETCH TO CONCLUDE THE PRESIDENT WAS SAYING THE ONLY WAY TO PROTECT DEMOCRACY IS TO VOTE DEMOCRATIC. AND AS SOME DEMOCRATS PRIVATELY CONFIDED TO JOURNALISTS, JOE BIDEN MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONNECT WITH SWING VOTERS WHO ARE MAINLY WORRIED ABOUT PAYING THEIR BILLS. I'M HOWARD KURTZ, AND THIS IS \"MEDIABUZZ.\" \u266a \u266a HOWARD: THE MEDIA ARE BELATEDLY, RELUCTANTLY AND IN MANY CASES SADLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE VIRTUALLY CERTAIN TO TAKE OVER THE HOUSE AND HAVE AN INCREASINGLY GOOD SHOT AT SEIZING CONTROL OF THE SENATE. A WASHINGTON POST STORY ACTUALLY SAYING THE DEMOCRATS ARE IN A PANIC.  REPUBLICANS ARE RIDING A WAVE OF OPTIMISM IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE FALL CAMPAIGN, EVEN EYEING SEATS DEEP INTO DEMOCRATIC TERRITORY.  VOTERS ARE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT THE ECONOMY, INFLATION AND CRIME IN THAT ORDER. JANUARY 6TH? NOT THERE. AND THEY TRUST REPUBLICANS TO HANDLE THESE ISSUES THE BEST.  REPUBLICANS ARE ON A POSITION REALLY TO WIN A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE. ONLY FIVE SEATS MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE. THE QUESTION IS HOW BIG OF A MAJORITY WILL THERE BE.  AN INSIDIOUS AND SEEMINGLY INTENTIONAL CAMPAIGN BY REPUBLICAN-BACKED POLLING FIRMS TO FLOOD THE ZONE AND TIP THE BALANCE OF POLLING AVERAGES IN FAVOR OF THEIR CANDIDATES.  LOOK, THE FATE IS SEALED FOR THE DEMOCRATS, A LOT OF US NOW THINKING, AND THEIR MEDIA LACKEYS, THEY'RE RESORTING TO INSANE THEORIES. HOWARD: JOINING US NOW TO ANALYZE THE COVERAGE IN NEW YORK, WILL CAIN, COHOST OF \"FOX & friends\" WEEKEND S AND IN CLEVELAND, GERALDO RIVERA, A MEMBER OF \"THE FIVE.\" WILL, IT'S BEEN OBVIOUS FOR WEEKS THIS RENGTS ELECTION WAS BREAKING IN THE REPUBLICANS' DIRECTION. WHY DO YOU THINK THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA ARE FINALLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT?  I GUESS BECAUSE IT'D BE -- IT'S UNDENIABLE, HOWARD. WHAT WILL BE FASCINATING IS HOW THEY EXPLAIN IT IN RELATE TO PROSPECT ONCE IT'S OVER. THEY CAN'T REALLY ASK JOE BIDEN TO FOCUS ON KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES. HE DOESN'T HAVE A POSITIVE MESSAGE THAT HE CAN PUT FORWARD WHEN IT COMES TO INFLATION OR TO CRIME. SO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS LARGELY ADOPTED THESE VERY, VERY, VERY UNPOPULAR IDEAS, WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S ON GENDER OR THE DENIAL OF A RISING CRIME RATE. AND SO IN LIEU OF TALKING ABOUT THESE VERY, VERY U.N. POPULAR IDEAS -- UNPOPULAR IDEAS, IT'S GO BACK TO THE WELL, IT'S GO BACK TO JANUARY 6TH. AND IT'S GOING TO BE A LOSING MESSAGE FOR HEM INCOME A MATTER OF -- THEM IN A MATTER OF DAYS. HOWARD: DEMOCRATS FEAR MIDTERM DRUBBING AS PARTY LEADERS RUSH TO DEFEND BLUE SEATS. OBVIOUSLY, EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON TURNOUT, THAT'S ALWAYS THE X FACTOR, BUT DO YOU SEE THESE PREDICTIONS AS KIND OF A BUTT-COVERING EXERCISE FOR THE MEDIA GERALDO?  YEAH. I GUESS YOU CAN SAY THAT, HOWIE. BUT TIMING IS EVERYTHING IN LIFE, AND CERTAINLY POLITICS IS PART OF LIFE. A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, MID OCTOBER, I THINK THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A WHOLE DIFFERENT VIBE, A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY. YOU HAD OZ TRAILING IN PENNSYLVANIA, YOU HAD VANCE FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE HERE. HERSCHEL WALKER BATTERED BY ONE SCANDAL AFTER ANOTHER IN GEORGIA. SO GEORGIA, PENNSYLVANIA, OHIO ALL WERE IN PLAY A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. NOW THEY'RE, I THINK, OZ IS AHEAD IN PENNSYLVANIA. HERE VANCE IS AHEAD IN OHIO, HERSCHEL WALKER HAS STEADIED HIS CAMPAIGN. I WOULD SAY LOOKING AT SOME OF THE POLLS THAT YOU ALREADY BROADCAST THIS MORNING, HOWIE, THAT HERSCHEL WALKER IS AHEAD IN GEORGIA. SO I THINK THE DEMOCRATS MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY. ABORTION HAS FADED, INFLATION IS WEARING ON PEOPLE, IT REALLY IS. PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SPEECH THAT YOU AND WILL WERE SPEAKING ABOUT EARLIER, VERY DISAPPOINTING. HOWARD: YEAH.  HE'S A NICE GUY. HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE, YOU KNOW, MR. PARTISAN. I DON'T THINK HE'S EVER MADE A GREAT SPEECH, BUT THAT ONE WAS PARTICULARLY IRRITATING TO MANY PEOPLE -- HOWARD: I'LL COME BACK TO THAT.  I THINK THE DEMOCRATS ARE REALLY ON THEIR BACK FOOT. HOWARD: YEAH. TIMING IS EVERYTHING AND, OBVIOUSLY, THERE'S BEEN EARLY VOTING, BUT ELECTION DAY IS HUGE. WILL, THE MEDIA BACK DURING THE PRIMARIES WROTE OFF MANY OF THE TRUMP-BACKED, MAGA CANDIDATES AS NO WAY THEY CAN WIN A GENERAL ELECTION, THEY'RE TOO EXTREME, THIS IS GREAT FOR THE DEMOCRATS. AND NOW MANY OF THESE PEOPLE -- KARI LAKE, BLAKE MASTERS, HERR SHELL WALKER -- ARE AT LEAST TIED. SO WAS THIS A TREMENDOUS MISTAKE ON THE PART OF THE PRESS?  YES, ABSOLUTELY. BUT A PREDICTABLE MISTAKE, HOWARD. LOOK, OKAY, FOR THE BETTER PART OF 7-8 YEARS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, AND BY EXTENSION, THE MEDIA'S FOCUS HAS BEEN EXCLUSIVELY ON DONALD TRUMP. AS A RESULT, ALL THESE ISSUES THAT ARE NOW SO IMPORTANT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EXISTED UNCOVERED UNDERNEATH THE SURFACE. THE ECONOMY, INFLATION, CRIME AND SO FORT. BUT THEIR FOCUS HAD ONLY AND ALWAYS BEEN ON DONALD TRUMP. THEY THOUGHT BY MAKING ALL OF THESE INDIVIDUALS -- KARI LAKE, DR. OZ -- SURROGATES FOR DONALD TRUMP, THEY COULD STAY ON THE SAME THEMES. WHAT THEY DIDN'T REALIZE WAS THAT THOSE CANDIDATES, NOT ONLY THE POLICIES, BUT THOSE CANDIDATES THEMSELVES ARE VERY POPULAR. AND BY THE WAY, THEY'RE RIDING A WAVE OF POPULARITY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DONALD TRUMP.  YEAH. WHAT'S AMAZING IS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS WHEN DONALD TRUMP HASN'T BEEN PRESIDENT, OBVIOUSLY, HE STILL GETS A LOT OF COVERAGE AND PART OF THAT IS THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S DOING. GERALDO, WAS THIS CASE OF JOURNALISTS ON THE COASTS LIVING IN A BUBBLE, AND THE COUNTRY MAYBE IS A BIT MORE CONSERVATIVE OR MORE FED UP THAN THE PUNDITS WERE WILLING TO BELIEVE?  WELL, I DON'T KNOW. OZ WAS A PRETTY FLAMBOYANT CHOICE AS WAS HERSCHEL WALKER IN GEORGIA, YOU KNOW? THEY WEREN'T RUN OF THE MILL CANDIDATES. THE PRESIDENT, THE FORMER PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT TRUMP, ENDORSING THEM REALLY, YOU KNOW, IN MANY WAYS BOTHERING THEIR CANDIDACY WAS OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM. BUT, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE QUALITY PEOPLE. I WAS MT. TALK SHOW BUSINESS WITH MEHMET OZ, HE'S A GREAT GUY. I THINK THAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN STUNNED BY OPRAH'S ENDORSEMENT OF JOHN FETTERMAN, BUT I ALSO THINK THAT HE HAS, HE HAS SURGICALLY, IF I MAY -- [LAUGHTER] USE HIS PROFESSION, HIS FORMER PROFESSION, WORKED HIS WAY BACK. AND I THINK THAT HERSCHEL WALKER, SIMILARLY, I THINK HE WAS HELPED BY GEORGIA CRUSHING TENNESSEE YESTERDAY AND TO BE PROBABLY NUMBER ONE IN THE NATION MT. NCAA FOOTBALL -- IN THE NCAA FOOTBALL. SO THESE ARE FAMILIAR PEOPLE THAT GRADUALLY HAVE GOTTEN THEIR STRIDE, YOU KNOW? RYAN WAS COMPETITIVE THE HERE IN OHIO, I THOUGHT THAT HE WAS GOING TO DO IT, BUT HE HAS -- HE HAD THAT GREAT LINE THAT OHIO NEEDS ASS KICKERS, NOT ASS KISSERS. BUT VANCE HAS, YOU KNOW, HE'S A QUALITY GUY, HILL BILLY EL JILL -- \"HILLBILLY ELEGY\" WITH, YALE LAW SCHOOL. HE'S FINALLY FOUND HIS FOOTING ALSO. SO I THINK VANCE WINS, I THINK OZ WINS, AND I THINK HERSCHEL WALKER WINS, AND I LOSE $1,000 TO JESSE WATTERS. [LAUGHTER] HOWARD: LOOK, MAYBE THEY DID SEEM 'EM EXTREME BACK DURING THE PRIMARIES, BUT MAYBE THE DEFINITION OF WHAT'S ACCEPTABLE PARTICULARLY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE HAS CHANGED. I WANT TO CIRCLE BACK, WILL. THE BIDEN SPEECH ON DEMOCRACY. THERE WERE QUITE A NUMBER OF LIBERAL PUNDITS, AND THIS WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISING, SAYING THIS WAS NOT WHAT MOST AMERICANS WANTED TO HEAR SIX DAYS OUT. EVENTHEY AGREED WITH THE SUBSTANCE, EVEN IF THEY AGREED WITH THE SUBSTANCE.  YEAH. PAINT ME AS KEPT CALL -- SKEPTICAL, I'M SURE THERE ARE SOME WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVE DEMOCRACY IS ON THE LINE. BUT THE WAY THIS HAS HYPERBOLICALLY BEEN RAISED, JIM CRY BERN SAYING WE'RE ON THE VERGE OF NAZI GERMANY, SONNY HOSTEN ON \"THE VIEW \"SAYING WE'RE POLITICAL COCKROACHES. HOWARD: THAT WAS HISTORIAN MICHAEL BESCHLOSS WHO SAID, ESSENTIALLY ARE, IF THE DEMOCRATS DON'T AT LEAST CONTROL SOMETHING, CONGRESS ON TUESDAY.  I DON'T THINK THAT'S RESONATING WITH ANY SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF AMERICA. IT IS EASILY DISMISSIBLE. HOWARD: WELL, GERALDO, NEWS OUTLETS ARE REPORTING THAT BIDEN WANTED TO GIVE THIS SPEECH FOR WEEKS. HERE HE IS ATTACKING TRUMP AND MAGA REPUBLICANS. WHAT DO YOU THINK? IS HE SAYING WHEN HE GOT MORE PARTISAN ABOUT IT, WHEN HE MENTIONED THE FORMER PRESIDENT THAT UNLESS DEMOCRATS WIN, THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS GOING TO GO TO HELL?  I, I HATE THAT STUFF, HOWIE. I HATE THAT. IT REALLY, IT PAINTS THE COUNTRY IN A WAY THAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN A CIVIL WAR. I DON'T BELIEVE IT. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE IS AN ESSENTIAL SOCIAL CONSERVATIVISM IN AMERICA. PEOPLE SETTLE DOWN. WE CAN HAVE OPPOSITE POINTS OF VIEW. I CERTAINLY DISAGREE MOST OF -- WITH MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES AT \"THE FIVE\" AND FOX, BUT I REALLY THINK WHAT HAPPENED IS BIDEN GAVE A SPEECH THAT OBAMA MAYBE HOW MUCH GIVEN. HE'S MUCH MORE SMOOTH, MORE ARTICULATE, MORE PERSONABLE IN MANY WAYS, IT WOULD HAVE SEEMED LESS PARTISAN I THINK IF THE FORMER PRESIDENT, PRESIDENT OBAMA, HAD GIVEN THE SPEECH RATHER THAN PRESIDENT BIDEN. WHEN PRESIDENT BIDEN DID IT, LIKE YOUR BEST PAL WHO NEVER PICKED A FIGHT WITH ANYBODY ALL OF A SUDDEN PRETENDING THAT HE'S THE TOUGH GUY, HE'S GOING TO TAKE YOU IN THE BACKYARD AND BEAT THE HELL OUT OF YOU. I JUST THINK IT WAS ILL-ADVISED, AND AS I SAID EARLIER, I DON'T THINK HE'S EVER GIVEN A GREAT SPEECH, AND THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST ILL-TIMED, PARTISAN ATTACK EVER. HOWARD: WELL, YOU KNOW -- VERY BRIEFLY.  IF I COULD REALLY QUICKLY, JOE BIDEN DISCUSS HAVE A WAY OF -- DOES HAVE A WAY OF SAYING IT IN AN ANGRY MANNER, BUT BARACK OBAMA SAID THE SAME STUFF. HE SAID DEMOCRACY IS ON THE LINE. THIS IS --  SOURCE POETIC.  IT ISN'T LIKE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GERALDO AND MYSELF OR EVERYBODY ELSE. [LAUGHTER] NATIONALLY, IT'S A RELATIONSHIP OF YOU'RE A THREAT, AND YOU MUST BE SILENCED. HOWARD: ALL RIGHT. OBAMA DID IT IN A MOCKING WAY WHICH HE HAS A CERTAIN TALENT FOR. BY THE WAY, TIFFANY CROSS HAS BEEN FIRED BY MSNBC ABRUPTLY, LIKE, SHE'S OFF THE AIR IMMEDIATELY. AND WHILE THERE'S SOME ATTEMPT TO BLAME THIS ON CONSERVATIVE CRITICISM, REPORTS SAY SHE WAS WARNED REPEATEDLY ABOUT -- I WAS ALWAYS STUNNED BY SOME IS OF HER RACIALLY-INFLAMMATORY ATTACKS. FOR EXAMPLE, CALLING CLARENCE THOMAS JUSTICE THE PUBIC HAIR ON A COKE CAN, AND THE FINAL STRAW SEEMED TO BE WHEN SHE WENT ON SOME INTERVIEW AND TALKED ABOUT A PHALLIC SYMBOL FOR FLORIDA AND THEN SAID LET'S CASTRATE FLORIDA. HOURS LATER, MSNBC CUTTING TIES. > WHEN WE COME BACK, A CONFESSION IN THE BRUTAL HAMMER ATTACK ON NANCY PELOSI'S HUSBAND. HOW MUCH ARE THE MEDIA TRYING TO TIE THE TRAGEDY TO THE MIDTERM CAMPAIGN? \u266a MUCK FINISH IF Landscaper Larry and his trusty crew... 20221106161323.401|20221106161635.942",

        "trs": "HOWARD: THE SECOND WOMAN TO ACCUSE HERSCHEL WALKER OF PRESSURING HER INTO HAVING AN ABORTION STILL USING THE NAME JANE DOE WENT ON CAMERA WITH ABC'S JU-JU CHANG ON GOOD MORNING AMERICA.  HE SAID THAT BECAUSE OF HIS WIFE'S FAMILY AND POWERFUL PEOPLE AROUND HIM, THAT I WOULD NOT BE SAFE AND THAT THE CHILD WOULD NOT BE SAFE.  THAT'S VERY MENACING.  IT IS VERY MEN NATEING. MENACING. THAT IS VERY MENACING. AND I FELT THREATENED, AND I, I THOUGHT I HAD NO CHOICE. HOWARD: THE ACCUSER SAID SHE TOLD HER PARENTS AND FRIENDS SHE'D HAD A MISCARRIAGE.  JUST WAS VERY SHAMEFUL, AND I FELT LIKE I HAD BEEN MANIPULATED. HOWARD: JASON, NOW THAT WE CAN SEE THIS WOMAN AND SHE'S GOT HANDWRITTEN LOVE NOTES FROM HERSCHEL WALKER AND PICTURES OF THEM IN HOTELS, DOES HIS DISMISSAL OF THIS AS A LIE SEEM LESS CREDIBLE?  I THINK IT'S HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS WHEN IT COMES DAYS BEFORE AN ELECTION. THIS COULD HAVE COME OUT YEARS AGO, IT COULD HAVE COME OUT MONTHS AGO, BUT THESE ALLEGATIONS, WHEN THEY COME OUT SO CLOSE TO ELECTION, I THINK, ARE HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS. AND IT'S, YOU KNOW, HE SAID/SHE SAID. PEOPLE HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT AND MAKE HAIR -- THEIR OWN DECISION, BUT I THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BLOW PAST THIS AND VOTE FOR THE PERSON THEY FEEL MOST COMFORTABLE WITH, AND HERSCHEL WALKER IS BELOVED BY THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA. HOWARD: I THINK IT'S CERTAINLY FAIR TO QUESTION THE TIMING AND HOW THIS HAS COME OUT. 0ER78, SHE'S PROVIDED A FAIR AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE. I'VE ALWAYS FELT IF HERR HERSCHEL WALKER HAD APOLOGIZED AND SAID HE WOULDN'T MAKE THE SAME DECISION TODAY, THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA WOULD HAVE FORGIVEN HIM. BUT DOES THIS MEAN REPUBLICANS JUST WANT TO WIN THE SEAT WHERE HE'S GOING UP AGAINST RAPHAEL WARNOCK NO MATTER WHAT?  YEAH, I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR. WE WOULD BE HAVING A VERY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. I THINK REPUBLICANS WOULD BE HAVING A VERY DIFFERENT CONVERSATION IF HE HAD A D BEHIND HIS NAME INSTEAD OF AN R, RIGHT? THEY WOULD NOT BE BENDING OVER BACKWARDS, STANDING BEHIND HIM AS ACCUSER AFTER ACCUSE E, HIS OWN FAMILY, HAS COME OUT AND SAID. I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT THE REPUBLICANS, YOU KNOW, THEY WANT TO WIN THIS SEAT, THEY WANT TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE SENATE, AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE DECIDED, THEY'RE GETTING BEHIND THIS CANDIDATE. HOWARD: WELL, THERE ARE A TOTAL OF TWO WITH ACCUSERS, AND WE DON'T KNOW THE NAMES AS BEING REPRESENTED BY GROVER A RAH -- GLORIA ALLRED. LET ME TURN TO JOHN FETTERMAN AND THE PENNSYLVANIA RACE AGAINST DR. OZ. HE IS ESSENTIALLY TIED WITH OZ. SOME POLLS HAVE IT ONE OR TWO POINTS, AFTER THAT DISASTROUS DEBATE AFTER HE RECOVERS FROM A STROKE. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN ANCHORS THAT HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN GRANTING HIM DO-OTHERS. HERE'S DON LEMON, ARE REINVENTED ON CNN'S NEW MORNING SHOW, TALKING TO FETTERMAN.  HAVE YOUR HEALTH ISSUES IMPACTED YOUR APPROACH TO POLICY AND WHAT YOU WOULD DO IN WASHINGTON?  I THINK IT'S MADE ME VERY EMPATHETIC ABOUT, MORE THAN I EVEN THOUGHT I WAS BEFORE. HOWARD: SO, JASON, UNLIKE IN THE GEORGIA RACE, I DON'T SEE THE MEDIA MAKING THE CHARGE THAT, OH, DEMOCRATS JUST WANT TO WIN THE SEAT AND, THEREFORE, THE COMMUNICATION PROBLEMS ARE IRRELEVANT, THAT DEMOCRATS WILL JUST DO ANYTHING TO HANG ON TO THAT OR TAKE OVER THAT SEAT.  YEAH. THEY'RE CERTAINLY TRYING TO REHABILITATE HIM, BECAUSE ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PLAY BACK THE TAPE OF THE DEBATE, AND YOU'RE GOING TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE RIGORS IN THE UNITED STATES, FETTERMAN, I THINK, IS TOTALLY DISQUALIFIED FROM HOLDING THAT. LOOK, WE HAVE HIGHLY QUALIFIED PEOPLE, THINK OF TAMMY DUCKWORTH, THE DEMOCRAT SENATOR IN ILLINOIS, THINK OF BRIAN MAST, THE CONGRESSMAN IN FLORIDA, WHO ARE INJURED AND SEVERELY INJURED SERVING OUR COUNTRY. OF COURSE THEY CAN SERVE. BUT, BUT HAVING A STROKE AND NOT BEING ABLE TO COMPREHEND AND DO THE ANALYTICS AND HAVING COGNITIVE CAPABILITY CHALLENGES THAT FETTERMAN'S HAVING, I THINK, DISQUALIFIES HIM. AND I THINK THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA WILL FIGURE THAT OUT. HOWARD: YEAH. OBVIOUSLY, IT'S UP TO THE VOTERS. FETTERMAN MAKES THE CASE THAT BY JANUARY, IF HE WERE ELECTED, HE WILL BE MUCH FURTHER ALONG IN HIS RECOVERY PROCESS. JOY AND OTHER LIBERALS HAVE DONE SYMPATHETIC CLOSED CAPTIONING WITH FETTERMAN, AND HE'S DONE MUCH BETTER THAN IN A FAST-PACED DEBATE, BUT ARE THEY TRYING TO REHABILITATE HIM?  I HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR PEOPLE IN YOUR INDUSTRY. I WAS JUST WATCHING ON -- A SEGMENT ON MARIA'S SHOW AND WATCHING THE INTERVIEW WITH HERSCHEL WALKER. I THINK DON LEMON IS A TALENTEDDED HOST, AND AND FETTERMAN'S BEEN ASKED DIFFICULT QUESTIONS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE MEDIA COVERAGE THE DAY AFTER THE DEBATE, I WOULDN'T EXACTLY SAY EVERYBODY WENT EASY ON HIM. HOWARD: OKAY. DON LEMON DID ASK HIM ABOUT WHY HE WON'T RELEASE HIS MEDICAL RECORDS, BUT OTHERWISE THE QUESTIONS WERE SYMPATHETIC.

RACHEL:  WE'RE NOT DONE TALKING TO THE VOTERS. I'LL BE IN WISCONSIN ON ELECTION DAY, PETE WILL BE IN PENNSYLVANIA. HE LIKES ANY TOWN WITH THE NAME WAR IN IT. WILL WILL BE IN  SATELLITE BEAC, FLORIDA AND LAWRENCE WILL BE IN GEORGIA. WE'LL BE FANNED OUT, TRYING THE TO GET YOUR POINT OF VIEW AHEAD OF THE ELECTION.   WE'LL BE TALKING TO YOU BEFORE YOU HEAD TO THE POLLS TO SEE WHICH WAY YOU'RE LEANING AND HOW YOU'LL CAST YOUR VOTE.   I THINK THIS IS YOUR FIRST ELECTION DAY WITH US. RACHEL:  MINE TOO.   OUT AT TIMERS, DID WE GO TO -- DINERS, DID WE GO TO DINERS LAST TIME.   PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.   WE DID? MY MEMORY IS SHORT. RACHEL:  IT WILL BE MY FIRST TIME.   IT'S JUST A NEXT LEVEL. THE FEELING YOU HAVE ON ELECTION NIGHT, IT'S CONSEQUENTIAL AND IT REALLY MATTERS. MOST THINGS ARE NOT CONSEQUENTIAL. SPORTS GAMES, IT'S UNPREDICTABLE BUT NOT CONSEQUENTIAL OR WHAT YOU DO FOR A JOB IS CONSEQUENTIAL BUT IT'S NOT UNPREDICTABLE. ELECTION NIGHT IS CONSEQUENTIAL AND UNPREDICTABLE. SO TO GET A SMALL GLIMPSE IN THE KEY STATES WITH VOTEERS IS A TON OF PHON. FUN.YOU CAN FEEL THE EXCITEMENTN THE AIR. AS VIEWERS, WE SHARE WITH YOU -- I SEE PEOPLE ON THE STREET, HEY, ARE YOU READ READY FOR TUESDAY? WE'RE READY FOR TUESDAY. RACHEL:  IT IS U HE PREDICT -- IT'S UNPREDICTABLE. WEATHER CAN IMPACT DEPE DEPEND E YOU ARE IN THE UNITED STATES.   WHAT HAPPENED DOWNSTAIRS, IS IT CONSEQUENTIAL OR UNPREDICTABLE. I WOULD PROBABLY CHOOSE BEAUTIFUL. WATCH. \u266a [LAUGHTER]   IF YOU COULD TURN DOWN JASON'S SAXOPHONE, WHAT WOULD THAT SOUND LIKE? HE'S CARRYING US THROUGH THAT.   HONKING HORNS IN NEW YORK N. RACHEL:  LET ME GIVE YOU THE UPSIDE. PUT THAT BACK UP WITHOUT SOUND. IF THEY TUNE DOWN OUR -- THIS WOULD BE LIKE --  CUT OUR MICS. RACHEL:  TURN DOWN US AND TURN UP JAY SON, WE LOOK LIKE WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE'VE GOT THE MOVES. IT'S NOT BAD.   THERE'S A LOT OF COMMITMENT. RACHEL:  NOT BAD.   A LOT OF COMMIT MMENT. RACHEL:  ME AND RICK DID BACK TO BACK MOTION.   LOOK AT YOUR SERIOUS FACE. RACHEL:  I KNOW. I REALLY GOT INTO IT.   BY THE WAY -- RACHEL:  WE SOUND AWFUL THOUGH.   IT'S NATIONAL SAXOPHONE DAY. WE LIKE TO HONOR THOSE DAYS ON THE WEEKEND SHOW. WE OWNED IT. RACHEL:  WE DID. SOMEBODY THAT IS ABOVE THESE KIND OF ANTICS IS A FRIEND OF OUR SHOW AND AMAZING VOICE IN THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT, THAT IS MARK LEVINE. HE IS THE HOST OF LIFE AND LIBERTY. MARK, WELCOME TO OUR CRAZY SHOW.  I'M AGAINST THOSE KIND OF ANTICS, NOT THESE, RIGHT BOBBLE HEAD, THIS IS BOBBLE HEAD JOE BIDEN. THAT WAS FASCINATING. I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY FRIGHTENING. SOUNDED LIKE A BEE HIVE, ACTUALLY. [LAUGHTER]   THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD WAY TO LOOK AT IT. EXACTLY RIGHT. RACHEL:  GREAT ANALOGY.   WE WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE DEMOCRATS' CLOSING ARGUMENT. JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN ABOUT USEFUL TO DEMOCRAT AS THE BOBBLE HEAD ON YOUR DESK SO THEY DEPLOYED BARACK OBAMA TO MAKE THE FINAL ARGUMENT. HERE'S A PORTION OF WHAT HE SAID.   I UNDERSTAND THAT DEMOCRACY MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE A TOP PRIORITY RIGHT NOW. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT PAYING THE BILLS. BUT WHEN TRUE DEMOCRACY GOES AWAY, WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT HISTORY, WE'VE SEEN AROUND THE WORLD, WHEN TRUE DEMOCRACY GOES AWAY PEOPLE GET HURT. IT HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES. THIS IS NOT AN ABSTRACTION. GOVERNMENTS START TELLING YOU WHAT BOOKS YOU CAN READ AND WHICH ONES YOU CAN'T. DISSIDENTS START GETTING LOCKED UP. REPORTERS START GETTING LOCKED UP IF THEY'RE NOT TOWING THE PARTY LINE. CORRUPTION REINS BECAUSE THERE'S NO ACCOUNTABILITY. PEOPLE GET HURT. THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES.  MARK, IS HE TALKING -- HE MUST BE TALKING ABOUT REPUBLICANS BUT HE SOUNDS A LOT LIKE HE'S LAYING OUT THE CASE FOR WHAT DEMOCRATS MIGHT DO.   YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING, WHEN YOU POINT A FINGER AT SOMEBODY YOU'RE POINTING THREE FINGERS AT YOURSELF. SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. LET ME ASK BARACK OBAMA A QUESTION. HOW COME IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THIS, JOE BIDEN HASN'T CALLED OUT THE NATIONAL GUARD? HOW COME IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THIS, YOU HAVEN'T MOVED YOUR MONEY OFFSHORE? HOW COME IF YOU REALLY BELIEVED THIS YOU HAVEN'T SOLD ONE OF YOUR FIVE MANSIONS? HOW COME IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THIS YOU'RE NOT REALLY ACTING LIKE IT? THESE PEOPLE ARE PA PATHETIC. THEY'RE TRYING TO DESTROY THIS COUNTRY, DIVIDE THIS COUNTRY, SCARE THIS COUNTRY. THEY'RE DESPERATE. IT COMES DOWN TO KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES WHICH IS WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY? THEY MADE LIFE MISERABLE FOR THE AVERAGE FAMILY IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY'RE IMPOVERISHING AMERICANS. AMERICANS ARE AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS AS A RESULT OF THE PROPAGANDA FROM THE PARTY. THE ONLY PARTY THAT TRIED TO DESTROY DEMOCRACY, THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. WE HAD TO FIGHT A CIVIL WA WAR O KEEP THE COUNTRY TOGETHER. WE HAD TO FIGHT A CIVIL RIGHTS BATTLE FOR 150 YEARS BECAUSE THE DEMOCRAT PARTY DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT EVERYBODY WAS EQUAL. DESPITE LOSING THE CIVIL WAR, THEY TEAMED UP WITH T KLAN, UP O 11940 THEY WOULDN'T OUTLAW FDR LYNCHING. LET'S TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS. I'M HAPPY TO TALK ABOUT THEM WITH BARACK OBAMA OR JOE BIDEN. WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRACY BEING DESTROYED AND THE THIRD REICH. , THEY SAY TONE DOWN THE RHETORIC ON THE OTHER HAND THEY BRING IN THE THIRD REICH AND SO FORTH. HERE'S WHAT I BET. I YOU WILL BET JOE BIDEN $10 MILLION, I'LL USE AMERICAN MONEY, HE CAN USE HIS CHINESE MONEY, I WILL BET JOE BIDEN $10 MILLION THAT COME WEDNESDAY, WE'LL STILL HAVE -- IT'S NOT A DEMOCRACY, A CONSTITUTIONAL HE REPUBLIC. WHAT DO YOU SAY JOE? AS FAR AS OBAMA GOES, DOES IT SEEM LIKE HE'S WORRIED ABOUT DEMOCRACY UNRAVELING IN THIS COUNTRY AS HE FLIES AROUND WITH HIS AN PARTICULARS AND SO FORTH -- ANTICS AND SO FORTH. I WOULD SAY TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE OBAMA ON THE ROAD BECAUSE HE'S A LOSER. THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, EIGHT YEARS OF THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY THEY LOST 1,030 SEATS IN THE STATE LEGISLATURES AND IN CONGRESS. SO HAVE HIM RUN AROUND AND SO FORTH HAD AND SO ON. AND SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, THIS IS REALLY PATHETIC. THESE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE WHO CALL REPUBLICANS DEPLORABLES AND WHITE SUPREMACISTS. I WROTE IT DOWN, INSURRECTIONSIST, THREATS TO DEMOCRACY, SEMIFASCISTS. ROACHES. THE REPUBLICANS ARE WELL-KNOWN FOR BURNING DOWN CITIES AND LEADING RIOTS AND TRYING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT, OH, THOSE ARE ALL THE REPUBLICANS OUT THERE WHO ARE MARCHING DAY IN AND DAY OUT, ALL THOSE REPUBLICANS OF OUT THERE. WHAT A BUNCH OF CRAP. THE DEMOCRAT PARTY HAS NEVER EMBRACED THIS COUNTRY. NEVER. IT'S NEVER SUPPORTED AMERICANISM. IT SUPPORTED EVERYTHING BUT AMERICANISM.  BOY, MARK, I THINK YOU ONLY LEFT ONE THING OFF THE LIST RIGHT THERE. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE INFLATION AND HYPERBOLIC ACCUE SAGESES ALL THE WAY TO -- ACCUSATIONS ALL THE WAY TO COCKROACHES. THE ONLY THING YOU LEFT OFF WAS A THREAT TO YOUR CHILDREN AND CHILDREN LIVES.  A HISTORIAN 50 YEARS FROM NOW THE IF HIS HOURANS ARE ALLOWED -- HISTORIANS ARE ALLOWED TO WRITE IN THE COUNTRY AND IF THERE'S STILL FREE PUBLISHING HOUSES AND FREE PRESS, WHICH I'M NOT CERTAIN OF, BUT IF THAT IS TRUE A HISTORIAN WILL SAY WHAT WAS AT STAKE TONIGHT AND THIS WEEK WHETHER WE WILL BE A DEMOCRACY IN THE FUTURE, WHETHER OUR CHILDREN WOULD BE ARRESTED AND CONCEIVABLY KILLED, WE'RE ON THE EDGE OF A BRUTAL AUTHORITARIAN SYSTEM AND A IT COULD BE A WEEK AWAY.   IF YOU BELIEVE THAT TO BE THE CASE, WHY HAVEN'T YOU CALLED OUT THE NATIONAL GUARD, IT'S INTERESTING THAT YOU CALLED THAT OUT. IT'S INTERESTING, IF YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE SITTING ON THE EDGE OF A THREAT, WHAT WOULDN'T YOU DO? WOULDN'T YOU CENSOR YOUR POLITICAL OPPOSITION? WOULDN'T YOU CALL OUT THE NATIONAL GUARD? WOULDN'T YOU ENSURE BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY THAT YOU WOULD WIN AN ELECTION? IF YOU BELIEVED THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WOULDN'T DO.   HE'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE CORRUPTION OF ACADEMIA. HE'S A SO-CALLED HISTORIAN WHO GIVES ADVICE TO BIDEN AND HE'S NOT ALONE. WHAT THEY'RE REALLY UPSET ABOUT THE DEMOCRAT PARTY IS THIS, THEY EXPECTED AFTER PRESIDENT OBAMA THAT HILLARY WOULD TAKE THE THIRD TERM AND TRUMP COMES IN AND DEFEATS HILLARY AND THEY'REY WANT TO DESTROY HIM AND GET HIM OUT. THEY DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE MIDTERM. THEY KNOW THEY HAVE BIDEN IN THERE TWO MORE YEARS. IF THEY CAN HOLD THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE AND MAYBE PICK UP A SEAT OR TWO IN THE SENATE, THEN THE COUNTRY WILL CHANGE FOREVER. THE SUPREME COURT WILL CHANGE, THE T SENATE WILL CHANGE, WE'LL HAVE FOUR MORE DEMOCRATS, VOTING SYSTEM WILL CHANGE. THEY WILL CHANGE THIS COUNTRY FOREVER. SO WHAT I HAVE FOUND OUT WITH THE DEMOCRATS IS WHEN THEY USE PHRASES AND ATTACK US, THEY'RE REALLY DESCRIBING THEMSELVES. IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THEY SAY. THEY CREATE A DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THAT'S ANTI-EDUCATION. THEY CREATE ALL A THESE OTHER DEPARTMENTS, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY THAT'S ANTI-ENERGY. THEY HAVE A BORDER P PATROL THAS ANTI-BORDER PATROL. YOU CAN GO ON AND ON. THEY'RE GOOD AT PROPAGANDA AND BRAIN WASHING. WHAT THEY'RE NOT GOOD AT IS MANAGING THE COUNTRY. THEY'VE HAD TWO YEARS TO RUN THE COUNTRY AND THEY'VE RUN IT INTO THE GROUND. YOU CAN'T FIND ONE THING THEY HAVEN'T DESTROYED, WHETHER THE BORDER, THE DOLLAR, ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. THEY'VE DESTROYED EVERYTHING SO THEY NEED TO BE BEATEN. THEY NEED TO BE BEATEN BADLY. YOU HAVE TO IGNORE WHAT THEY SAY AND THEIR MEDIA SURROGATES. ONE OTHER THING. THIS GUY, BESHLOT TALKS ABOUT A FREE PRESS. WE DON'T HAVE A FREE PRESS. WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT PARTY PRESS, PROPAGANDA DAY IN AND DAY OUT. NOT A DIME'S WORTH OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TALKING POINTS THE DEMOCRAT PARTY PUT OUT AND AMERICAN MEDIA PUT OUT. THEY'RE UTTERLY, COMPLETELY CORRUPTED. 90% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN'T STAND THEM AND KNOW ABOUT IT. IF THE P FREE PRESS IS BEING HE DESTROYED, IT'S BECAUSE OF THIS GENERATION OF NARCISSISTS. RACHEL:  THE LEFT IS TALKING ABOUT, BARACK OBAMA IS TALKING ABOUT THREATS TO DEMOCRACY. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY WILL DO IF THEY WIN. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TO THE IDEA OF EQUAL JUSTICE IN THE COUNTRY. THEY WEAPONIZED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENEMIES, FROM DONALD TRUMP DOWN TO THE AMERICAN CITIZENS PROTESTING PEACEFULLY AT ABORTION CLINICS WHO ARE BEING DRAGGED OUT OF THEIR HOME BY THE FBI AND S.W.A.T. RAIDS. SO I THINK THAT'S ALSO ON THE BALLOT TODAY. I TALK TO A LOT OF CONSERVATIVES AND THEY TELL ME THEY'RE WORRIED THAT THEY'RE THE TARGET.  THEY'RE 100% CORRECT. LOOK, I USED TO WORK AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. THE THINGS THE JUSTICE D DEPARTMENT ARE DOING NOW ARE UNCONSCIONABLE. THEY'VE WEAKENED LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT, THEY HAVE TO REGARD FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE AVERAGE PEOPLE OUT THERE DON'T HAVE SECURITY, THEY DON'T HAVE SAFETY. THE CRIME IS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF AND THEY DOWN PLAY IT, THE MANY DEMOCRATS. ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY WANT OF TO UP-PLAY REPUBLICANS THAT ARE A THREAT TO THE COUNTRY AND SO FORTH BUT NOTICE THEY EMPOWERED FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY ADDED 87,000 FBI AGENTS, THEY'RE THERE TO ET THREATEN THE AVERAGE CITIZEN. THEY HAVE 160 OR 70,000 IRS AGENTS. THINK ABOUT THAT. AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SIT THERE WITHS SHOES ON THE DESK, CHEWING GUM. THEY'RE GOING TO COME AFTER THE PEOPLE. THE FBI IS THE MODERN STASI AND I TELL YOU THIS AS SOMEBODY WHO ALWAYS SUPPORTED THEM AND IT'S NOT JUST THE TOP OF THE FBI AS THE REPUBLICANS SAY IT'S A WHOLE CULTURE OVER THERE AND IT'S DISGUSTING AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES IS COMPLETELY CORRUPT AND POLITICIZED. LOOK AT THE TOP FIVE POLITICAL APPOINTEES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THEY'RE RADICAL OBAMA LEFTISTS, IF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL A, THE DEP I DID DEPUTY ATTORNEYGENERAL, ASSOCIAY GENERAL, THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION, CRIMINAL DIVISION. THE U.S. ATTORNEY IN WASHINGTON IS GOING AFTER TRUMP, GOING AFTER PEACEFUL PROTESTERS INVOLVED IN JANUARY 6th, GOING AFTER DOCUMENTS, THIS MICKEY MOUSE STUFF. YOU LOOK AT WHO HE IS AND WHO HIS WIFE IS, THESE ARE HARD CORE RADICALS THAT THEY'VE PUT IN THERE. AND THE ONLY WAY TO BEGIN TO SLOW THIS DOWN, THE ONLY WAY TO BEGIN TO SLOW THIS DOWN IS ON TUESDAY AND SHOULD WE WIN BIG AND I WOULD TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE STOP LISTENING TO THIS RED WAVE STUFF. SHOULD WE WIN BIG, AND I HOPE IT IS, BUT YOU DON'T RUN ELECTIONS THAT WAY, THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO BE HELD TO ACCOUNT BY PEOPLE LIKE US. BECAUSE THEY BETTER GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS AND BETTER FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE WHEN OBAMA IS RUNNING AROUND SAYING WE'RE GOING TO LOSE OUR DEMOCRACY, A MAN WHO HAS NEVER BELIEVED IN THIS COUNTRY, A MAN WHO HAS NEVER BELIEVED IN THIS FOUNDING, A MAN WHO BELIEVES IN THE 1619 PROJECT AND CRITICAL RACE THEORY AND ALL THE REST OF IT, THAT SHOULD TELL YOU THAT FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE DEMOCRACY MEANS ONE PARTY RULE, IRON FISTED CONTROL AND THE POLITICIZATION OF FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.   THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THERE'S A REASON WHY THEY CALL HIM THE GREAT ONE, MARK LEVINE, THANKS FOR JOINING US ON THIS SUNDAY MORNING, TWO DAYS FROM THE ELECTION.   OKAY. MORE, PLEASE. RACHEL:  GOOD-BYE. [LAUGHTER]   THANK YOU, MARK. RACHEL:  GOOD-BYE, JOE BIDEN. THANK YOU MARK. TURNING TO HEADLINES, 38 PEOPLE ARE HURT IN A MASSIVE MANHATTAN APARTMENT FIRE SPARKED BY A FAULTY BATTERY YESTERDAY. DRAMATIC VIDEO SHOWS FDNY FIREFIGHTERS PULLING OFF A HEROIC RES Y RESCUE OF A WOMAN S DANGLING FROM A SMOKING WINDOW. EYEWITNESSES DESCRIBE THE SCENE AS THE SCARE GILIEST THEY'VE --E SCARIEST THEY'VE EVER SEEN. OFFICIALS BELIEVE THE FAULTY T BATTERY WAS ON AN E-BIKE OR E-SCOOTER.  THE ASTROS ARE THE NEW WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONS, THEY CLOSED OUT THE SERIES AT HOME TAKING DOWN THE PHILADELPHIA PHILLIES IN GAME SIX LAST NIGHT.   THERE GOES THE RUNNER, FLY BALL DOWN THE RIGHT FIELD LINE. KYLE TUCKER, THIS TIME THEY FINISH THE JOB! THE HOUSTON ASTROS WORLD CHAMPIONS!   THIS WORLD SERIES WIN MARKS A FIRST FOR TEAM MANAGER DUSTY BAKER, THE 73-YEAR-OLD IS THE OLDEST MANAGER TO WIN A WORLD SERIES IN MLB HISTORY. RACHEL:  AS   AND THOSE ARE YOUR HEADLINES.   DON'T MOVE, HOUSE MINORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY IS HERE WITH THE GOP GAME PLAN TO MAKE HIM SPEAKER. RACHEL:  BILL CLINTON PULLS NO PUNCHES, TALKING ABOUT LEE ZELDIN'S CRIME CONCERNS.   HE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE KATHY HOCHUL GOES EVERY MORNING TO THE NEAREST SUBWAY STOP AND HANDS OUT BILLY CLUBS AND BASEBALL BATS TO EVERYONE THAT GETS ON THE SUBWAY.  MARTHA MacCALLUM JOINS US LIVE, NEXT.   AS WE JAZZ IT UP, JAZZ YOUR MORNING UP WITH SOME MORE SAXOPHONE. \u266a 20221106142120.343|20221106142246.296",

        "trs": "RACHEL: WELCOME BACK TO TO \"FOX & friends.\" THE BIG ONE IS COMING. THAT'S A WARNING FROM A U.S. MILITARY NUCLEAR COMMANDER WHO SAYS, QUOTE, IT ISN'T GOING TO BE THE VERY LONG BEFORE OUR COUNTRY GETS TESTED IN WAYS THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN TESTED IN A LONG TIME. AS U.S. MILITARY DETERRENCE FALLS BEHIND CHINA. HERE TO ASSESS THE REAL THREAT, FELLOW AND DIRECTOR FOR CHINESE STRATEGY AT THE HUDSON INSTITUTE THE, MICHAEL PILLSBURY. MICHAEL, SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON, AS ALWAYS. WE HAD GORDON CHANG, ANOTHER CHINESE EXPERT ON, A FEW WEEKS AGO, AND HE THOUGHT THAT MILITARY CONFLICT WITH CHINA WAS A REAL POSSIBILITY EVEN WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR, AND SO NOW WE HAVE THIS ADMIRABLE -- ADMIRAL GIVING US A WARNING AND ALSO SAYING WE'RE NOT PREPARED MILITARILY FOR THIS KIND OF A CONFLICT. SO, FIRST OF ALL, HOW UNUSUAL IS IT THAT WE'RE GETTING THIS KIND OF WARNING FROM A U.S. NAVY ADMIRAL?  IT'S VERY UNUSUAL BECAUSE HE'S NOT JUST A NAVIED A MILLER, HE'S THE HEAD OF OUR STRATEGIC FORESTS. HE'S RESPONSIBLE -- FORCES. HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE NUCLEAR BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN OURSELVES, RUSSIA AND CHINA. SO THIS KIND OF WARNING IS VERY SERIOUS. IT'S NOT A WARNING OF IMMEDIATE CONFLICT OR WAR THAT WE SHOULD ALL JUST JUMP IN OUR SHELTERS NOW, IT'S A WARNING THAT THE LONG-TERM TREND, ESPECIALLY SINCE THIS PAST YEAR, IS IN FAVOR OF CHINA BECOMING THE DOMINANT MILITARY POWER IN THE WORLD. NOW, THAT'S IN PEACETIME AS WELL AS IN A POSSIBLE WAR. AND THE KEY ISSUE HERE IS THE STRANGE SILOS THAT CHINA TALIBAN TO DIG OUT IN FAR WESTERN CONCERN BEGAN TO DIG OUT IN FAR WESTERN CHINA A WORLD OR TWO AGO. THEY TOLD THE WORLD THIS IS FOR WIND TURBINE POWER, WE'RE GOING TO PUT THESE BIG WIND TURBINES IN HERE, THEN THEY BEGAN TO TEST ICBMs WITH A LOT OF WARHEADS ON. SO THE ADMIRAL IS MAKING THE CALCULATION, WHICH IS PROBABLY CORRECT, 360 SILOS, 10 WAR HIGHWAYS PER MISSILE -- WARHEADS PER PER PER MISSILE, THAT PUTS CHINA AHEAD OF BOTH RUSSIA AND AMERICA IN THE BALANCE OF POWER. NOT THAT THERE'D BE A WAR, BUT YOU COULD COERCE PEOPLE, YOU COULD TRY TO DOMINATE THEM, FORCE THEM TO DO THINGS BECAUSE YOU WERE SUPERIOR. YOU WERE, LIKE, THE NUMBER ONE BULLY IN THE WORLD. AND WE TRIED TO KEEP IT EQUAL BETWEEN OURSELVES AND THE RUSSIANS AND ALSO HAVE STABILITY TALKS, CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MEASURES, MEETINGS ALL THE TIME. WE HAVING NONE OF THAT WITH CHINA. RACHEL: YEAH. WE'VE BEEN DOING REPORT AFTER REPORT ON THIS SHOW ABOUT OUR MILITARY NOT BEING PREPARED. SO HERE WE HAVE THIS SITUATION THAT IS VERY ALARMING AND, BY THE WAY, IT SOUNDS LINE OUR LEADERS WERE CAUGHT FLAT FOOTED IN TERMS OF THIS EXPANSION BY THE CHINESE. WHY DON'T YOU ADDRESS THAT. HOW DID OUR LEADERS GET LULLED INTO NOT SEEING? IF IS THAT ELITE CAPTURE BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT? WHAT'S HAPPENING? [LAUGHTER]  IT'S A KIND OF ELITE CAPTURE, YES. WHAT YOU BASICALLY HAVE IS A GROUP OF PROGRESSIVES WHO THINK THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. RACHEL: THAT'S RIGHT.  AND SINCE CHINA'S THE WORLD'S BIGGEST POLLUTER, THEY WANT TO GET ALONG WITH CHINA. THEY'RE REALLY HURT BY THE CHINESE CALLING OFF THE CLIMATE CHANGE TALKS AS A PROTEST OVER NANCY PELOSI'S VISIT. SO THIS GROUP OF PROGRESSIVES COMBINED WITH AMERICAN WISHFUL THINKING HAS LED TO THE IDEA THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO A CHINESE MILITARY THREAT. I THINK IT'S A PARTISAN ISSUE. KEVIN McCARTHY WANTS TO DO A ROT ABOUT THIS IF WE GET THE RED WAVE. RACHEL: THEY'RE SAYING THE BIGGEST THREAT IS CLIMATE, AND CLEARLY THE BIGGEST THREAT IS CHINA. I HAVE TO ASK YOU ONE LAST QUESTION. IS JOE BIDEN COMPROMISED BY CHINESE INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE OF HIS FAMILY'S BUSINESS CORRUPTION, AND HOW MUCH WILL THAT INFLUENCE OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THIS IN THE NEXT, AT LEAST IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS WHILE HE'S PRESIDENT THAT WE KNOW OF?  I THINK IT'S AN ELECTION ISSUE. YOU FIND AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT BIDEN TALKING ABOUT COMPETITION WITH CHINA AS THOUGH IT'S BURGER KING AGAINST McDONALD'S -- RACHEL: RIGHT.  -- NOT SEEING THE CHINESE AS A MAJOR MILITARY THREAT. I THINK THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON THE CHINA THREAT AND A LOT OF SUSPICION ABOUT THE BIDEN FAMILY, I MUST SAY. RACHEL: YEAH. NO QUESTION ABOUT IT, WE NEED THOSE QUESTIONS ANSWERED IN ORDER FOR OUR COUNTRY TO BE SAFE AND TO KNOW THAT OUR LEADER TRULY HAS OUR BEST INTERESTS IN MIND CAN AND IS NOT COMPROMISED BY CHINESE INTELLIGENCE. MICHAEL PILLSBURY, I HOPE YOU'LL KEEP SPEAKING ON THIS, IT'S SO IMPORTANT. MICHAEL PILLSBURY, OR THANK YOU.  THANKS, RACHEL. RACHEL: HOW'S THIS FOR A CAMPAIGN STRATEGY, INSULTING VOTERS?  I LOVE THOSE SIGNS WHEN I CAME IN, SOCIALISM. GIVE ME A BREAK. [LAUGHTER] WHAT IDIOTS.  THEY'RE NOT IDIOTS. OKAY, NOW GRANTED, THERE'S 330 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY, MAYBE A GOOD 80-90 MILLION -- THE. [LAUGHTER] AREN'T VERY BRIGHT. RACHEL: GUY BENSON AND MY HUSBAND, SEAN DUFFY, REACT TO THE LEFT'S RAMPED-UP RHETORIC COMING UP NEXT. \u266a \u266a \u266a  I LOVE THOSE SIGNS WHEN I CAME IN, SOCIALISM. [LAUGHTER] GIVE ME A BREAK. WHAT IDIOTS.  OKAY, NOW GRANTED, THERE'S 330 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY, MAYBE A GOOD 80-90 MILLION AREN'T VERY BRIGHT -- [LAUGHTER]  WHITE, REPUBLICAN, SUBURBAN WOMEN ARE NOW GOING TO VOTE REPUBLICAN.  WHY?  IT'S ALMOST LIKE ROACHES VOTING FOR RAID.  THEY'VE TAUGHT PEOPLE THE WORD INFLATION, RIGHT? MOST PEOPLE WOULD HAVE NEVER USED THAT WORD EVER IN THEIR LIVES. PETE: DEMOCRATS AND THEIR ENABLERS IN THE MEDIA RAMPING UP INSULTS JUST DAYS BEFORE VOTERS OFFICIALLY MAKE THEIR CHOICE IN THE VOTING BOOTH, IF THEY HAVEN'T VOTED ALREADY. JOINING US NOW, FORMER WISCONSIN CONGRESSMAN SEAN DUFFY ALONG WITH FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR GUY BENSON. GREAT OF TO HAVE YOU BOTH.  GOOD TO SEE YOU. PETE: JUST TWO DAYS OUT, SEAN, IT SEEMS LIKE THE DEMOCRATS' CLOSING ARGUMENT IS TO CONDESCEND AND INSULT VOTERS WHO DON'T AGREE.  AND LIE TO THEM. SO SO JOE BIDEN WAS CALLING A BUNCH OF KIDS WHO WERE CALLING HIM SOCIALIST LIARS OR IDIOTS, BUT ALL THESE POLICIES ARE THE POLICIES OF THE DEMOCRAT SOCIALISTS, OF THE SQUAD, OF BERNIE SANDERS. BUT THEN TO DEMEAN VOTERS? TELL THEM ALL THE GREAT WORK YOU'VE DONE, JUST DON'T TELL THEM THEY'RE STUPID. THIS IS LIKE THE OLD BRAND PAPA WHO'S JUST ON HIS COUCH -- GRANDPA, IS ANGRY AND IS MAD AT EVERYBODY IN THE FAMILY. PETE: GUY, IT FEELS LIKE THIS IS, OF MANY, SUCH A STARK CONTRAST. REPUBLICANS HAVE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE RUNNING ON, THEY'RE PROACTIVE, MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE AT. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A PARTY GRASPING AT ISSUES TOWARDS THE END?  DESPERATE, I THINK, IS THE RIGHT WORD. MAYBE THEY'RE GOING TO PULL A RABBIT OUT OF A HAT, BUT ALL THE INDICATIONS SEEM TO BE HEADED IN A CERTAIN DIRECTION. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CLOSING ARGUMENTS FROM THESE TWO PARTIES, THE DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING DEMOCRACY'S ON THE BALLOT, OCCASIONALLY MENTIONING ABORTION, THEY'RE INSULTING THE INTELLIGENCE OF VOTERS. REPUBLICANS ARE TALKING ABOUT INFLATION, THE ECONOMY, CRIME. AND THOSE ARE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING, THE TOP ISSUES FOR MOST VOTERS AS OPPOSED TO WHAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE TALKING ABOUT. IS SO I THINK WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME WHAT I CALL PRECRIMINATIONS, FINGER POINTING IN ADVANCE OF EXPECTED LOSSES, AND THAT'S USUALLY NOT A GREAT SIGN FOR THE PARTY ENGAGED IN THEM. PETE: FOR SURE. YOU'RE BOTH GOING TO BE WATCHING THIS CLOSELY, AS WE ALL ARE. SEAN, GIVE US A BIT OF A PREVIEW. WHAT WILL BE THE STORY ON WEDNESDAY MORNING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAY OF THE LAND TWO DAYS OUT? WHAT ARE THE STORYLINES YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?  SO THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES ARE GOING TO WIN RACES THAT THE POLL POLLSTERS DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE GOING TO WIN, NUMBER ONE. AND NUMBER TWO, DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO SIT BACK AND SAY, WE MADE A MISTAKE. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ABORTION, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT RADICAL REFLYNNS -- REPUBLICANS, EXTREMISTS, WE WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT MATTER TO AMERICANS. AND TO THIS POINT, YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THEM INTERNALLY FIGHT AND THROE -- THROW STONES BECAUSE THEIR LOSS IS GOING TO BE SO HUGE. PETE: SAME QUESTION TO YOU, GUY.  WELL, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE LEFT TALKING ABOUT HOW DEMOCRACY IS NOW ALMOST DEAD -- [LAUGHER] BECAUSE ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN WON BY -- PETE: BECAUSE DEMOCRACY HAPPENED OVERNIGHT, YES.  I THINK WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT A SPEAKER-ELECT OR A SPEAKER-IN-WAITING, KEVIN McCALIFORNIA THINK. PETE: WHICH WILL FOLLOW WITH A FIGHT OVER WHO THE MAJORITY LEADER WILL BE IN THE SENATE.  I THINK IT WILL BE COCAINE MITCH McCONNELL, TO BORROW A NAME HE'S HAD IN THE PAST. THEY GET TO 51, WHICH I THINK IS ENTIRELY PLAUSIBLE. BUT IF YOU START TALKING ABOUT THE WAVE SEAN IS ANTICIPATING, WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT 52, 53, WAY OUT THERE, 54. IF THINGS BREAK, RIGHT, THOSE LATE BREAKERS ALL GO IN ONE DIRECTION -- SEAN: WHO'S GOING TO LEAD THE DEMOCRAT PARTY? THERE'S GOING TO BE A HUGE FOOD FIGHT AS TO WHO'S GOING TO WIN THE -- RUN THE DEMOCRAT PARTY. CANDIDATES CAN FEEL WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. THEY KNOW THE WIND'S TO THEIR BACK OR IN THEIR FACE. THEY CAN TELL HOW THINGS ARE GOING. YOU TALK TO CANDIDATES, AND THEY'RE, LIKE, I'VE NEVER EXPERIENCED A CYCLE LIKE THIS. THIS IS REALLY, REALLY GOOD, AND I THINK THEY'RE THE BEST INDICATORS BECAUSE THEY'RE TOUCHING SO MANY VOTERS. PETE: THE OTHER THING THAT WILL HAPPEN ON WEDNESDAY MORNING, THE RACE FOR 2024 FINISH.  BEGINS.  STOP IT.  CAN WE SLEEP FOR, LIKE, A DAY? PETE: NOT AT ALL. SPEAKING OF NO SLEEP FOR GUY BENSON, YOU'RE COHOSTING A SPECIAL EDITION OF OUTNUMBERED TODAY AT NOON --  YES, SIR. OUTSIDE. PETE: IT'S OUTSIDE?  DO YOU PUT A SUIT ON FOR THAT OR JUST JEANS?  I THINK SO. IT'S THE COUCH -- IT'S USUALLY A COUCH. PETE: YOU CAN THANK CLIMATE CHANGE FOR THE BEAUTIFUL WEATHER. THANK, GUYS, APPRECIATE YOU. WILL, UP TO YOU. WILL: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU. WE'LL START WITH THIS, A FEW ADDITIONAL HEADLINES THIS MORNING. A MASSACRE AT A MARYLAND HOME AS POLICE SAY A MAN KILLED FOUR PEOPLE BEFORE TURNING THE GUN ON HIMSELF. THE SUSPECT'S EX-GIRLFRIEND, HER BROTHER AND THEIR MOTHER ALL DYING ALONG WITH ANOTHER MAN WHO WAS ALSO INSIDE. THE KILLER'S MOTIVE REMAINS A MYSTERY. > ITALY TAKING A FIRM STANCE ON THE SECURITY OF ITS BORDERS UNDER ITS NEW PRIME MINISTER, THE GOVERNMENT DENYING NGO SHIPS FULL OF MY GRANTS FROM ENTERING THE COUNTRY, ONLY ALLOWING CHILDREN AND PEOPLE OF URGENT9 NEED OF MEDICAL CARE TO GET OFF. ITALY SAYS THE NGOs SHOULD SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM THEIR OWN FLAG NATIONS. BOTH SHIPS DENIED FRIDAY WERE UNDER GERMAN FLAGS. > ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE SOME COLLEGE FOOTBALL ACTION STARTING WITH MY VICTORIOUS TEXAS LONGHORNS, THEY UPSTATE KANSAS STATE. NOT THAT INSPIRING. ELSEWHERE, THE GEORGIA BULLDOGS DOMINATING THE NUMBER ONE TEAM IN THE COUNTRY DURING ITS 27-13 WIN OVER TENNESSEE. THAT, NOW, WAS CONVINCING. NOTRE DAME, BY THE WAY, PULLED OFF A MAJOR UPSET OVER NUMBER 4 CLEMSON, 35-14. IT'S THE FIGHTING IRISH'S SECOND CONSECUTIVE WIN OVER A RANKED OPPONENT. AND MICHIGAN STATE PICKING UP A 23-15 WIN OVER NUMBER 16, ILLINOIS, ON THE ROAD. AND FINALLY, LSU STUNNING THE MIGHTY ALABAMA CRIMSON TIDE IN A WILD 32-31 OVERTIME VICTORY. LOOK AT THIS, THIS GUTSY 2-POINT CONVERSION MADE THE DIFFERENCE FOR LSU.  DANIELS FOR THE WIN, CAUGHT, IT'S GOOD! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] LSU DOES IT! WILL: YOU'VE GOT A FRESH NEW TOP FOUR IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL, INCLUDES TCU AND MICHIGAN NOW. PLENTY MORE FOOTBALL TODAY WITH A WHOLE LINEUP OF GAMES THAT INCLUDE AARON RODGERS AND THE PACKERS TAKING ON THE DETROIT LIONS AT 1 P.M. EASTERN TIME. AND IF THOSE ARE YOUR HEADLINES.  SO WE HAVE A BIG FINAL HOUR AHEAD. WE HAVE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY, THE GREAT ONE, MARK LEVIN, MARTHA MacCALLUM, MARIA BARTIROMO AND CHARISSA THOMPSON JOINING US LIVE. BUT FIRST, WE'VE BEEN KNOWN TO GET PRETTY MUSICAL HERE ON \"FOX & friends\" IF WEEKEND.  PUT YOUR MOUTH ONTO THE HARMONICA ABOUT MIDDLE WAY UP, CLOSE YOUR LIPS AND GO TICK-A-TICK-A, AND YOU'LL GET THAT JOHNNY CASH DRUM BEAT. \u266a  JUST LIKE THAT. JUST LIKE THAT. PERFECT. \u266a \u266a WILL: ALL RIGHT. SO UP NEXT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO OUTDO THAT. WE GET A SAX LESSON FROM A PRO ON NATIONAL SAXOPHONE DAY. \u266a \u266a 20221106134915.918|20221106135222.271",

WE'LL LOOK AT SOME FORECASTS. PETE: YOU WANT TO BE BRET OR MARTHA? I WILL BE MARTHA, YOU BE BRET. WILL: THINK ABOUT THAT ONE FOR A LITTLE WHILE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE HOUSE, SEE WHAT THE FORECASTS ARE FOR GOP VERSUS DEMOCRATIC CONTROL. THE FORECAST ACCORDING TO FOX NEWS IS REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. YOU CAN SEE A BEST CASE SCENARIO FOR BOTH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON THIS WALL. PETE: ABSOLUTELY. 218 WHAT YOU NEED TO GET A MAJORITY AND BASED ON THE FORECASTING OF POLLS AGGREGATED THUS FAR IN THE POWER RANKINGS IS MOST LIKELY SCENARIO IS REPUBLICAN CONTROL. YOU MENTIONED IT, WILL. THE BOTTOM IS THE CURRENT, BEST-CASE SCENARIO FOR BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, THE KEY TAKEAWAY ON THE SIDE, EVEN THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO POWER RANKINGS HAS KEVIN McCARTHY AS SPEAKER OF HOUSE. WILL: PICKING UP SEATS WHAT WE SEE TODAY. IN THE REPUBLICANS BEST-CASE SCENARIO, THAT IS OVERWHELMING. PETE: SOME PEOPLE SAY THIS NUMBER COULD GO HIGHER IF THERE IS RED TSUNAMI, SOME DISTRICTS GIVEN OREGON, MINNESOTA, WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, ARE IN PLAY STATEWIDE, SOME OF THOSE HOUSE DISTRICTS COULD, YOU COULD SEE A NIGHT OVER 250. NOT LIKELY BUT POSSIBLE. WILL: LOOK AT PROJECTIONS BY THE SENATE, PROJECTION BY FOX NEWS DEMOCRATS HAVE 47 SEATS. REPUBLICANS HAVE 49 SEATS WITH FOUR IN THE COLUMN OF TOSS-UP. THOSE STATES, PETE, ARE OVER THERE ON THE MAP. PETE: HERE ARE THE TOSSUPS. HEARING A LOT ABOUT THEM. NEVADA, ADAM LAXALT, IN ARIZONA, BLAKE MASTERS IN A TIGHT RACE AS MARK KELLY, WASN'T SEEN AS TIGHT BUT TIGHTEN AD LOT. JOHN FETTERMAN AND MEHMET OZ, DOWN IN GEORGIA, HIS PROSPECTS ARE LIKE THE BULLDOGS YESTERDAY HE IS IN GOOD SHAPE. THEY PUT A WHIPPING ON TENNESSEE. WILL: REPUBLICANS TAKE TWO OF THE TOSSUPS, ACCORDING TO PROJECTIONS THEY HAVE THE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. PETE: ONLY NEED TWO OF THESE FOUR. BECAUSE WISCONSIN, OHIO, NORTH CAROLINA ARE LOOKING SOLIDLY IN THE REPUBLICAN CAMP. WILL: RIGHT. GOVERNORS WHICH FOCUSES ON SOME OF THOSE SAME STATES, NEVADA, ARIZONA, ADD TO THAT WISCONSIN, OR GONE, YOU CAN SEE REPUBLICANS REPUBLICANS, WELL OVER 30 GOVERNORS I BELIEVE OUT OF 50 STATES ARE REPUBLICAN. PETE: YEAH. WILL: MORE ON THE WAY. PETE: SOME SURPRISES YOU SHOULD BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR ON ELECTION NIGHT. MINNESOTA WITH DR. SCOTT JENSEN RUNNING TIGHT AGAINST WALTZ. TUDOR DIXON IN MICHIGAN RUNNING MUCH STRONGER CAMPAIGN THAN PEOPLE ANTICIPATED. IN NEW YORK, THIS WILL BE EARLY RETURN TO LOOK AT IN NEW YORK, IF LEE ZELDIN IS TIGHT, WHAT AN INDICATION BE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE COUNTRY. BIG ONE IN ARIZONA AS WELL. WILL: STILL IN THE TOSS-UP CATEGORY, KARI LAKE OUT-OF-STATE CAMPAIGNING. JOE BIDEN NOT GOING TO ARIZONA. ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT REPUBLICANS FEEL STRONG AND DEMOCRATS FEEL WEAK IN ARIZONA. PETE: THE OTHER ONE IF THE STATE OF OREGON IS YELLOW IN TOSS-UP, ANOTHER SENSE WHERE THE ELECTORATE IS RIGHT NOW. WILL: LOOK AT CANDIDATES WHAT THEY'RE SPENDING ON THE DEMOCRAT SIDE TO WIN OR FIGHT AGAINST ALL ODDS TO WIN THESE SEATS. RAFAEL WARNOCK IS BIG SPENDER, 76, ALMOST $76 MILLION FOR RAFAEL WARNOCK. ARIZONA, MARK KELLY, $73 MILLION. PETE: THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY, $68 MILLION TO GET THUMPED. VAL DEMMINGS WILL SPEND THAT MUCH IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. ALREADY IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA, SHE WILL GET BEAT. FETTERMAN, MORE MONEY POURING IN FOR HIM, JOE BIDEN AND BARACK OBAMA JED IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE TIM RYAN CAMPAIGN RAISED 44 MILLION, AGAIN ANOTHER CAMPAIGN LOOKS LIKELY TO GO FOR JD VANCE. I WILL NOTE IN A LOT OF THESE STATES DEMOCRATS ARE RUNNING AGAINST REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES THAT THEY SAID THEY WANTED TO RUN AGAINST. WILL: YES. FUNDED BY DEMOCRAT,. PETE: HERSCHEL WALKER, BLAKE MASTERS, KARI LAKE, MEHMET OZ, JD VANCE, DONALD TRUMP ADVANCED CANDIDATES THEY SAID WERE UNELECTABLE. THOSE CANDIDATES ARE ABOUT TO WIN. MANY CASES DEMOCRATS GAVE TO THE CANDIDATES. WILL: THEY WERE SO CONFIDENT, THOSE THESE QUOTE, UNQUOTE THEFTS TO DEMOCRACY WOULD LOSE TO A DEMOCRAT TO HELP FUND THE THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. PETE: THEY'RE ABOUT TO WIN. HOW MUCH OF THE CLOSING ARGUMENT OF DEMOCRATS IS ON ABORTION? WILL: 45% OF SPENDING FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ON THE MESSAGE OF ABORTION. LOOK AT THOSE STATES WHERE THEY'RE FOCUSING THAT MESSAGE. PETE: I WAS IN ARIZONA THIS WEEKEND A DINER IN, INFLATION IN ARIZONA, 13%. HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. YOU'RE FEELING IT. 45% OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN UP TO $100 MILLION IS ABOUT ABORTION. WILL: I WANT TO GO TO THE LAST WALL REALLY QUICKLY WHERE BIDEN, OBAMA, TRUMP ARE SPENDING TIME. PETE, HERE IS WHAT STANDS OUT TO ME REALLY QUICKLY, OBVIOUSLY DONALD TRUMP, TO SOME EXTENT BARACK OBAMA ARE SPENDING TIMES IN THOSE TOSS-UP STATES -- PETE: YEP. WILL: NONE, PENNSYLVANIA THE ONLY ONE THAT JOE BIDEN, THOSE CANDIDATES DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND JOE BIDEN. PETE: DEFENSE, DEFENSE, DEFENSE. WILL: THERE YOU GO. THAT IS OFF THE WALL. SHANNON BREAM IS COMING UP AS WE COUNT DOWN TO THE MIDTERMS. 20221106125640.912|20221106125810.234",

        "trs": "  ALL RIGHT. WE WANT TO TAKE YOU LIVE TO A PODIUM. THAT'S HOW ON TOP OF THE NEWS WE ARE. THAT PODIUM PRETTY SOON WILL BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, IN JOLIET, ILLINOIS. HE'S DOING HIS PART TO GET THE WORD OUT AND VOTE, GET JAZZED BY THIS THING, BUT THAT'S WHAT THIS WHOLE DAY COMES DOWN TO AND THE WHOLE WEEK AND LEADING UP TO TUESDAY, HOW JAZZED ARE YOU ABOUT YOUR CANDIDATE OR THE ISSUES TO PUT IN THE EFFORT TO GET OUT AND VOTE, WHERE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE DONE SO EARLY. WE'VE TOLD ABOUT 23 BILLION HAVE BY MAIL BALLOT AS WELL. THAT'S IMPORTANT AND WHEN YOU HEAR MOST REPUBLICANS SHOW UP AT THE POLLS. WE'LL SEE HOW THAT SORTS OUT. THESE ARE RECORD NUMBERS NO MATTER HOW YOU SLICE IT. PROBABLY A STATE THAT'S GARNERING THE MOST INTEREST IF YOU WEIGH IT BY, I DON'T KNOW, PRESIDENTS OR FORMER PRESIDENTS IS PENNSYLVANIA. THAT'S WHERE YOU'LL FIND OUR RICH EDISON. HE HAS MORE FROM THAT BALLOT GROUND, RICH.  HEY, GOOD MORNING, NEIL. PLENTY OF PODIUMS HERE IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA HERE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE STATE HERE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH WHERE YOU'RE SOON GOING TO GET DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE JOHN FETTERMAN FOR SENATE AND THEN FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA AND TAKE THE ACT OUT EAST IN PHILADELPHIA TONIGHT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE THOSE TWO ALONG WITH THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR IN THIS STATE, JOSHUA SHAPIRO AND CURRENT PRESIDENT BIDEN. SO, THEY'RE REALLY HOPING THIS IS GOING TO BE A PICKUP FOR THEM, THE DEMOCRATS, THIS YEAR IN THIS ELECTION. FETTERMAN SAYS HE'S PROUD TO BE CAMPAIGNING WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT, AS WE'RE JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AWAY FROM ELECTION DAY.  WE'RE RUNNING A CAMPAIGN THAT IS, I THINK, GROUNDED IN THE KINDS OF VALUES THAT IS VERY MUCH PART OF PENNSYLVANIA. THE OTHER SIDE HAS SPENT MOST TO $100 MILLION. $100 MILLION TO JUST, REALLY JUST TRY TO TEAR US DOWN, YOU KNOW, AND IT'S A CLOSE RACE, IT'S A JUMP BALL FOR SURE.  AND OBAMA HAS ALREADY CAMPAIGNED FOR DEMOCRATS IN CLOSE RACES AND PLACES LIKE WISCONSIN, GEORGIA, ARIZONA, FETTERMAN FACES SEVERAL CHALLENGES IN THE LAST FEW DAYS OF THE CAMPAIGN. HE HAD A SIGNIFICANT POLLING LEAD THIS SUMMER THAT NARROWED TO A RACE WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR IN SEVERAL POLLS, QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS HEALTH HAVING A STROKE IN MAY. REFUSAL TO PRODUCE MEDICAL RECORDS AND PROCESSING WORDS IN SPEAKING. FETTERMAN SAYS HE AND HIS DOCTORS BELIEVE HE'S FIT TO SERVE IN THE SENATE. AND REVERSAL ON FRACKING, A FULL SUPPORTER AFTER THE GOVERNMENT ADDRESSED ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND FEFETT ER  FETTERMAN IS LOOKING AT HIS OPPONENT'S STANCE ON ABORTION, AND  THERE WAS A MIDTERM ENVIRONMENT POLLING PICKUP OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. NEIL. NEIL: THANK YOU FOR THAT. RICH EDISON IN PENNSYLVANIA. AS I MENTIONED, WE HAVE SO MANY FORMER PRESIDENTS AS WELL AS THE CURRENT PRESIDENT ON THE STUMP ON BEHALF OF CANDIDATES, BUT IT GOT ME THINKING, YOU HAVE BARACK OBAMA, YOU HAVE BILL CLINTON, DONALD TRUMP OF COURSE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, OF COURSE THE PRESIDENT HIMSELF IN ILLINOIS TODAY. IT'S LIKE A MARVEL MOVIE WITH ALL THE CAST OF CHARACTERS TOGETHER AND IT'S EYE-POPPING TO SEE WHEN YOU SEE THEM ALL TOGETHER IT'S EXPLOSIVE. THE TROUBLE WITH THIS PARTICULAR MARVEL GROUP THEY'RE NOT ALL ON THE SAME PAGE AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENCES BEHIND THE SCENES EVEN IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WHO'S GOT THE RIGHT MESSAGE TO GET OUT AND ADDS UP WITH SOME OF THOSE, LIKE BARACK OBAMA, AND HEAR HIM, AND WHATEVER YOU THINK OF THAT, A GIFTED POLITICIAN, BUT THE GUY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ISN'T YOU.  WELL, YOU'LL SEE TODAY FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND BARACK OBAMA BOTH CAMPAIGNING IN PENNSYLVANIA. AND FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL BE ALONGSIDE JOE BIDEN IN PHILADELPHIA THIS EVENING. PITTSBURGH AND PHILADELPHIA, TWO AREAS WHERE DEMOCRATS REALLY NEED TO BOOST THEIR TURNOUT IF THEY'RE GOING TO WIN IN PENNSYLVANIA AND POTENTIALLY, KEEP CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE. AND I THINK, AS RICH WAS POINTING OUT THERE A FEW MINUTES AGO, IT'S A VERY, VERY TIGHT RACE IN PENNSYLVANIA. THIS WAS ONCE SEEN AS A STATE THAT COULD BE A POTENTIALLY EASY PICKUP OPPORTUNITY FOR DEMOCRATS. BUT NOW THE RACE INSIDE USA TODAY'S POLLING AND OTHER POLLING IS INSIDE THAT MARGIN OF ERROR. NEIL: YOU KNOW, FRANCESCA, I'M WONDERING ABOUT THE WISDOM OF HAVING SOMEONE LIKE A BARACK OBAMA CAMPAIGNING FOR JOHN FETTERMAN AND TAKING NOTHING AGAINST FETTERMAN, YOU KNOW, HE HAD A STUMBLING DEBATE PERFORMANCE, A STROKE AND YOU KNOW THAT AND ENDORSED AND INTRODUCED BY SOMEONE WHO IS AS SAVVY AND SMOOTH ON THE STUMP AS ANY CANDIDATE IN U.S. HISTORY. THE COMPARISON IS FAIRLY DRAMATIC. I DON'T KNOW IF IT RINGS HOME TO VIEWERS AND TO VOTERS. WHAT DO YOU THINK?  WELL, DEMOCRATS ARE CERTAINLY HOPING THAT PUTTING BARACK OBAMA ON THE TRAIL NOT JUST IN PENNSYLVANIA, BUT IN OTHER KEY STATES, SUCH AS GEORGIA, AND NEVADA, WILL TURN OUT LOYAL DEMOCRATS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE SIT THIS ELECTION OUT. IF BARACK OBAMA TELLS YOU TO VOTE FOR SOMEBODY, WILL YOU VOTE FOR THAT PERSON IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT. NEIL: BUT WHEN HE'S NOT ON THE BALLOT IT'S NEVER HAPPENED. SO IF IN HIS FIRST MIDTERM DIDN'T HAPPEN, AND SECOND MEMBERSHIP DIDN'T HAPPEN. SCORES OF RACES SINCE, HASN'T HAPPENED.  WELL, AND REPUBLICANS, NEIL, SEEMINGLY FACE THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT, WHOM THEY ARE DEPLOYING IN THE FINAL DAYS OF THE RACE, AND HE'S ALSO NOT ON THE BALLOT YET REPUBLICANS ARE ALSO COUNTING ON DONALD TRUMP TO TURN OUT ALL OF HIS LOYALISTS IN THIS ELECTION WHEN THEY MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE COME OUT EITHER. NEIL: GOOD POINT. SO AS WE WAIT TO HEAR FROM DOUG FETTERMAN, I THINK HE'S GOING TO BE IN PITTSBURGH OR IS IN PITTSBURGH RIGHT NOW AND HE SEEMS TO MOSTLY SURVIVED THE DEBATE PERFORMANCE. ALTHOUGH HE TRAILS IN A COUPLE OF POLLS MAYBE OWING TO THAT DEBATE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?  HE DID HAVE A MUCH STRONGER LEAD A FEW MONTHS AGO PRIOR TO THAT DEBATE AND NOW, AGAIN, IN USA TODAY'S POLLING IT'S WITHIN TWO POINTS, THE RACE THERE. SO WE REALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THAT REALLY TIGHT RACE, JUST AS IT'S VERY CLOSE IN SOME OF THE OTHER KEY STATES LIKE GEORGIA. THAT COULD ALSO FLIP THE BALANCE, LIKE NEVADA, THAT COULD FLIP THE BALANCE AND ARIZONA, ALSO. NEIL: THANK YOU FOR THAT. F FRANCESCA CHAMBERS. LET'S GO TO CHRISTOPHER, A LITTLE BIT OF A COLLEGE POLLSTER. VERY GOOD TO HAVE YOU. MAYBE YOU CAN GIVE A SENSE OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING PARTICULARLY IN PENNSYLVANIA AND NOW THE ADDED DEVELOPMENT WHERE OPRAH WINFREY COMES OUT AND ESSENTIALLY SAYS TO THE STAR THAT SHE MADE A STAR, MEHMET OZ, I'M NOT FOR YOU, I'M FOR THE GUY YOU'RE RUNNING AGAINST. DOES THAT CARRY ANY WEIGHT IN PENNSYLVANIA?  NEIL, THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. AS YOU MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS SPOT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO THE STATE TO WORK FOR THE CANDIDATES RIGHT NOW ON BOTH SIDES AND BOTH THE GOVERNOR'S RACE AND THE SENATE RACE IN PARTICULAR. YOU KNOW, I WOULD NEVER BE ONE TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF OPRAH WINFREY IN INFLUENCING SOME VOTERS. IT'S AN INTERESTING DYNAMIC BETWEEN HER AND DR. OZ, SOMEONE THAT SHE OF COURSE HELPED MAKE FAMOUS. NEIL: RIGHT.  SO WE'LL SEE. EVERYTHING SEEMS TO MATTER IN PENNSYLVANIA, NEIL, GIVEN TIGHT RACES SO YOU LOOK ON THE MARGINAL VISITS AND YOU LOOK AT ENDORSEMENTS OF SOMEONE OR ANTI-ENDORSEMENT IN THE CASE THAT OPRAH WINFREY IS SAYING AND IT COULD BE IMPACTFUL. NEIL: AND AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW THE IMPACT OF ENDORSEMENTS FROM CELEBRITIES LIKE AN OPRAH, ALL OF THESE FORMER PRESIDENTS. YOU KNOW THIS FAR BETTER THAN I. I AM CURIOUS THOUGH, PENNSYLVANIA IS RATHER-- MAYBE KIND ISN'T THE WORK, OKAY REACTION TO FETTERMAN'S PERFORMANCE IN THAT DEBATE. TO ALMOST EVERYONE WATCHED IT, IT WAS PRETTY TOUGH TO WATCH. THEY'VE BEEN UNDERSTANDING, THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE'S BEEN THROUGH AND MAYBE THEY'VE EXTENDED THAT TO WISHING THE BEST FOR HIM FOR THE ELECTION, BUT I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE MORE OF A FALLOUT. ARE YOU SURPRISED SO FAR AND YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT TO POINT OUT THAT THE LEAD ISN'T WHAT IT WAS, IT'S BEEN REVERSED IN SOME CASES, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?  YEAH, AND NEIL, IT WASN'T A GOOD PERFORMANCE FOR THE LT. GOVERNOR, BUT OF COURSE, THE CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN HIS DEBATE ARE AFFECTED BY HIS HEALTH CONDITION AND LOTS OF PENNSYLVANIANS HAVE DEALT WITH HEALTH CONDITIONS BEFORE, IT'S A CHALLENGE. SO I THINK THERE'S A DEGREE OF EMPATHY, IF YOU WILL, FOR HIS PLIGHT AND IT MUST BE EVALUATED OR PUT INTO THE EVACUATION. WE HAD SEEN THE POLLS CLOSE BEFORE THE DEBATE. IF YOU LOOKED AT PENNSYLVANIA, YOU KNOW, FROM SEPTEMBER ONWARD, FETTERMAN'S LEAD HAD DECREASED LARGELY, I THINK, BECAUSE OF EFFECTIVE AD TARGETING BY THE OZ CAMPAIGN TO MAKE FETTERMAN APPEAR SOFT ON CRIME AND HE HAD ISSUES BEFORE THIS PARTICULAR DEBATE. SINCE THE DEBATE THERE HASN'T BEEN AN ENORMOUS SHIFT IN THE POLLS. IT'S A CLOSE RACE BY ANY STANDARD. NEIL: HOW DO YOU SEE IT ULTIMATELY GOING? WHO HAS THE MOMENTUM?  IT'S A GREAT QUESTION. IT SEEMS LIKE, SOMETIMES CANDIDATES PEAK TOO EARLY. OZ HAS HAD MOMENTUM THROUGH THE FALL AND I THINK THE DEBATE ADDED TO THAT, BUT I THINK IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO YOU'VE SEEN THE FETTERMAN TRY TO DIAL INTO A CLOSING ARGUMENT ABOUT OZ AND WEAKNESSES. ONE INTERESTING FACT FROM THE POLLING, WHILE THE RACES CLOSE, DR. OZ'S FAVORABILITY NUMBERS IN PENNSYLVANIA HAVEN'T MOVED THAT MUCH. I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE ANY PREDICTIONS. CYCLES ARE IMPORTANT IN AME AMERICANS AND I EXPECT THIS TO BE A CLOSE RACE. NEIL: AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO SO MANY BATTLE GROUNDS AND YOU'VE HEARD THAT TERM BATTLE GROUNDS, GIVE IT A REST. IF THERE WERE A DRINKING GAME AND YOU WOULD KEEP TRACK OF ME SAYING BATTLE GROUND, YOU'D BE COMPLETELY HAMMERED AND MAYBE YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT. I WANT TO GO TO MARK MEREDITH IN COLUMBUS, OHIO. THERE'S A BATTLE FOR THE SENATE SEAT. IT'S TITLE. AND MARK MEREDITH BLESSEDLY NOT HAMMERED AND FOLLOWING CLOSELY. WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?  WELL, NEIL, CHEERS TO YOU AND GOOD MORNING. AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT BOTH SENATE CANDIDATES IN OHIO IN THE BUCKEYE STATE. WE'RE IN A BAPTIST CHURCH WHERE THERE IS NO DRINKING IN THE COLUMBUS SUBURBS WHERE WE SEE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN ARE PRAYING THAT DEMOCRATS COME OUT TO THE POLLS. AND IT'S CLOSE, BUT THE RANKING LOOKING IT'S LEANING INTO REPUBLICAN. AND TIM RYAN HAS GIVEN IT A GOOD SHOT. 'S BEEN TRYING TO REACH THE MODERATE VOTERS, UNION HALLS, EMPLOYMENT CENTER. AS I MENTIONED, A SOUL TO THE POLLS EVENT TODAY. AND HE KNOWS THAT THIS RACE WILL ULTIMATELY COME DOWN TO TURNOUT.  WE'VE BEEN DOING REALLY WELL ON EARLY VOTE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. FOUR POINTS BETTER THAN THE LAST CYCLE ADVANTAGE SO OUR PEOPLE ARE THERE COMING IN EARLY. SO, THAT NARROWS WHO YOU HAVE TO TALK TO IN THE FINAL DAYS. AND THAT WILL BE, YOU KNOW, OUR FOLKS IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY.  AND THIS WEEKEND, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE JD VANCE IS ALSO OUT IN THE STATE AND DOING A BUS TOUR, CAMPAIGNING WITH OHIO'S REPUBLICAN TICKET INCLUDING THE INCUMBENT GOVERNOR MIKE DEWINE. WE CAUGHT UP WITH VANCE ON THE TRAIL. HE SAYS HE'S EAGER TO CAMPAIGN WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THE EVENT OF ELECTION AND A RALLY IN DAYTON. HE SAYS HE KNOWS WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO GET OUT THAT TRUMP VOTE NEXT TUESDAY.  I THINK IT'S ALL UP-SIDE FOR US. THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE OF THE RALLY ON MONDAY, I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE TURNOUT. WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE DOING GREAT.  ONE THING WE'RE GOING TO BE WATCHING IS BELIEVE IT OR NOT THIS WOULD IN ANY WAY SWAY ANY LAST MINUTE VOTERS WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT IN DAYTON. I'VE HEARD FROM BOTH CAMPAIGNS THINK IT WILL HELP OR WON'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE AT ALL. AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY MORE HINTS ABOUT THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RACE AND I ASKED VANCE WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD MEAN HE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY SUPPORT A 2024 TICKET AND HE SAID HE WOULD BACK HIM, BUT IS FOCUSING ON THIS RACE. AND IN THE BAPTIST CHURCH IN ONE OF THE BATTLE GROUND STATES, SO YOU CAN DRINK TO THAT. NEIL: I WAS WAITING AND YOU DID IT AT THE END. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MARK MEREDITH IN THE BATTLE GROUND STATE PENNSYLVANIA. AND DRINK UP THIS. 20221105154937.590|20221105155250.615",

        "trs": "NEIL: THE REAL TEST OF VOTER ENTHUSIASM IS IF THEY GO TO THE POLLS WHEN THE WEATHER OUTSIDE IS NASTY, NOTHING LIKE SOMEONE WHO WILL BRAVE THE ELEMENTS NO MATTER WHAT TO MAKE SURE THEY GET OUT AND VOTE. HOW IS THE COUNTRY LOOKING?  THE SCIENCE DOES SHOW THAT THE WEATHER AFFECTS TURNOUT BUT ALSO WHEN IT IS TOO NICE. THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE FOR 100 MILLION AMERICANS IN THE EAST ENJOYING BEAUTIFUL ABOVE AVERAGE TEMPERATURES, AND PENNSYLVANIA KEY COUNTIES LIKE FOX AND ALLEGHENY GETTING TEMPERATURES, IN GEORGIA TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 70s. FULTON COUNTY IS A PLACE TO WATCH TO SEE IF PEOPLE GET TO THE POLLS, OUT WEST WE HAVE A STORM COMING INTO CALIFORNIA. NEVADA LOOKING AT A RAIN/SNOW MIX, STORMY WEATHER, FULL AND WASHINGTON COUNTY IT WILL BE MESSY WEATHER. IN ARIZONA IN MARICOPA COUNTY THAT STORM PUSHES FURTHER INTO ARIZONA AND PART OF THE COUNTY WILL SEE SHOWERS BY THE AFTERNOON. ALONG 10, BESIDES THAT LOOKING AT THE RECOVERY FOR THESE FOLKS IN EASTERN TEXAS, OKLAHOMA, 73 TORNADO WARNINGS AND DATING REPORTS OF TWISTERS TOUCHING DOWN LAST NIGHT, REPORTS OF INJURIES. THAT STORM SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE GULF COAST STATES. IN NEW ORLEANS THE STORMS ARE MOVING INTO BILOXI ACROSS THE COASTLINE WHERE WE COULD SEE HEAVY DOWNPOURS, THOSE COULD BE DANGEROUS. THE FRONT STARTS TO SETTLE DOWN, A FEW SHOWERS IN MUSIC CITY AND NASHVILLE BEFORE THE SYSTEM DIES DOWN. WE WANT EVERYBODY TO GET TO THE POLLS, CHECK YOUR WEATHER ON THE FOX WEATHER APPS. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT MAKE THE EXCUSE WHETHER IT IS TOO HOT OR COLD OR DRY BUT IT IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO, GET OUR VOICES HEARD. NEIL: LOOKING AT THOSE WEATHER CONDITIONS, DON'T KNOW THE WEATHER CONDITIONS ACROSS FLORIDA, THEY LOOK PRETTY FAVORABLE. WE WILL SEE HOW CHARLIE CRIST FEELS ABOUT THINGS, TRYING TO TOPPLE RON DESANTIS. GOOD TO SEE YOU.  GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. NEIL: HOW IS THE WEATHER? COULD BE HOSPITABLE FOR YOUR SUPPORT OR MAYBE NOT.  THE SUN IS OUT, IT IS BEAUTIFUL IN DAYTONA BEACH, IN ORLANDO LATER TODAY AND TAMPA AND MIAMI, IF I COULD TALK TO YOU TONIGHT I COULD GIVE YOU THE WHOLE STATES BUT LOOKS GOOD. NEIL: WHEN YOU GAVE UP YOUR CONGRESSIONAL SEAT TO RUN FOR GOVERNOR NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS LEANING REPUBLICAN. THAT COULD CHANGE BUT IN PURSUING THE GOVERNORSHIP AGAIN ARE YOU WORRIED THE SEAT YOU LEFT ADDS TO THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY THEY COULD LIKELY GET NEXT TUESDAY?  A GREAT QUESTION. ERIC LIND IS RUNNING A GREAT CAMPAIGN, VERY MODERATE DEMOCRAT. NEIL: HE IS TRAILING.  LAST PAUL I SAW WAS A TIE, THESE THINGS CHANGE EVERY TEN MINUTES, LAST PAUL THEY WERE NECK IN NECK. IT WILL BE GREAT AND I THINK HE'S GOING TO WIN. NEIL: YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW HE'S PUSHING THE ROE VERSUS WADE DECISION AND GALVANIZE SUPPORT AMONG WOMEN IN YOUR STATE. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN AND FREEDOM TO CHOOSE, I AM WONDERING, IS THAT THE STRATEGY THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS? FOCUS ON THAT AND BRING OUT THE BASE?  IT IS THAT CERTAINLY BECAUSE A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS A VITAL ISSUE. WITH THE OVERTURNING OF ROE VERSUS WADE WE PUT THIS FRONT AND CENTER. I'M A PRO-CHOICE CHAMPION. RON DESANTIS SIGNED A BILL THAT WILL TAKE THAT AWAY EVEN IN CASES OF RAPE OR INCEST WHICH IS HARD FOR ME TO IMAGINE BUT AFFORDABILITY IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. WE ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE STATE TO LIVE IN. EVENTS HAVE GONE UP ABSORBED ONLY DURING THE DESANTIS ADMINISTRATION. NEIL: HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT? THAT IS WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO BE, THEY WANT TO BE IN FLORIDA. A GOVERNOR CAN'T CONTROL THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO MAKE IT LESS PRICEY?  WE HAVE A SPECIFIC BUDGET TRUST FUND, HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THE GOVERNOR HAS GUTTED AND RETURNED TO CORPORATIONS. NEIL: WITH THAT FORCIBLY LOWER PRICES OR MAKE SOME HOUSING AFFORDABLE?  MAKES IT AFFORDABLE FOR SOME GROUPS, THAT IS THE SIDE OF THE EQUATION, EITHER RENT OR PURCHASING OF A HOME AND THE MORE SEVERE ECONOMIC ISSUE IS PROPERTY INSURANCE. WE ARE THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. THE GOVERNOR HASN'T DONE ANYTHING TO ADDRESS IT. WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR PREVIOUSLY I HELD A SPECIAL SESSION ON PROPERTY INSURANCE, HELPING CONSUMERS. THAT'S THE KIND OF GOVERNOR FLORIDA NEEDS. NEIL: DOESN'T PROPERTY INSURANCE GO UP AS PER REAL ESTATE PRICES GO UP AND YOU ARE IN AN AREA, A BEAUTIFUL STATE WHERE YOU HAVE HURRICANES AND STORMS THAT MAKES IT GO UP MORE.  NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT. HURRICANE IAN HAS EXACERBATED THIS PROBLEM. IT WAS A CRISIS BEFORE THIS STORM AND THE GOVERNOR DID NOTHING TO BRING RATES DOWN AS I DID WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR THE FIRST TIME. WHAT FLORIDIANS WANT IS SOMEONE WHO IS NOT FOCUSING ON RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2024. GOVERNOR DESANTIS IS ATTEMPTING TO DO THAT WHICH WILL BRING UP AN INTERESTING TOMORROW, SUNDAY DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE A RALLY IN MIAMI. GOVERNOR DESANTIS WILL HAVE ONE IN TAMPA. AN INTERESTING TENSION GOING ON. NEIL: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS GOING TO SAY. I KNOW WHAT RON DESANTIS HAS SAID OF YOU, YOU ARE YOUR STUBBORN OLD DONKEY AND ALL OF THAT. IT HAS GOTTEN NASTY. IF YOU WERE TO LOSE, WHAT DO YOU DO AFTER THIS?  I'M GOING TO WIN SO I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT IT. IT'S NOT SOMETHING I ENVISION. PEOPLE AFFORDABLE GET OUT AND VOTE. A GREAT PARADE TODAY, HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE, FANS ARE EXCITED AND READY AND HAVE A BIG GAME LATER THIS AFTERNOON. I'M ENCOURAGED ABOUT THE PROSPECTS, THE LATEST POLL WHICH WAS DONE BY A GROUP OUT OF PENSACOLA HAD A STOPOVER GOVERNOR DESANTIS. THAT'S NOT BEEN REPORTED VERY MUCH. IT CAME DOWN TO THE WOMEN VOTE. LOOKED AT THE MAIL VOTE HE WAS AHEAD OF ME, ALL CREDIT TO HIM, 53%-47%. AMONG WOMEN WE WERE UP 58 MADE A DIFFERENCE IN A RECENT POLL. NEIL: THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY YOU'VE GOT THESE ADS FEATURING WOMEN AND FREEDOM TO CHOOSE. WOMEN ALSO VOTE AND SHOP AND SEE HIGHER PRICES AND ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. YOUR CAMPAIGN COMES DOWN TO THAT ONE ISSUE.  IT DOESN'T. AS I SAID BEFORE, IT IS AFFORDABILITY AS WELL, PROPERTY INSURANCE RATES MEN AND WOMEN HAVE TO PAY, UTILITY BILLS HAVE DOUBLED IN THE PAST YEAR BECAUSE THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR HASN'T REGULATED UTILITIES, FLORIDA POWER AND LIGHT, DUKE ENERGY, RATES GO UP AND UP AND UP AND WOMEN AS MEN, THAT'S NOT FUN. NEIL: I WANT TO BE CLEAR HERE. YOU SAID THAT ISSUE, THE ABORTION ISSUE, FREEDOM TO CHOOSE, YOU THINK THAT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO WOMEN THAN THE PRICE OF THINGS THEY ARE TRYING TO BUY AT THE GROCERY STORE?  I DO BECAUSE IT GOES TO THEIR VERY FREEDOM AND THE ESSENCE OF FREEDOM FOR WOMEN. SOME WHITE GUY IN THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION TELLING THEM WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR BODY OR HEALTH CARE, THEY DON'T LIKE THAT AND I DON'T BLAME THE. I'M AN ONLY SON RAISED WITH THREE SISTERS AND I WILL SAY THIS ON THE ECONOMY. IF I AM ELECTED GOVERNOR WE WILL NEVER HAVE A STATE INCOME TAX IN THE SUNSHINE STATE. IT HELPED US WAY TOO MUCH. NEIL: THANKS FOR TAKING THE TIME, CHARLIE CRIST, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA, WE ARTIE HAD GOVERNOR DESANTIS ON. THAT CONTEST IS ON. IT IS A BATTLE ROYALTHE THAT COULD RESHAPE THE COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE SUNSHINE STATE. MORE AFTER THIS. 20221105145724.723|20221105145747.745",

EVERYTHING ACROSS THE BOARD TO IMMIGRATION, TO QUALIFIED LABOR, FINDING A LABOR FORCE OUT THERE THAT IS ENCOURAGED TO WORK.  SUPPLY-CHAIN ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING EVERY SMALL BUSINESS AND THE COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES, HOW HIGH THEY HAVE BEEN.  COSTS HAVE BEEN OUT OF CONTROL, SUPPLY CHAIN IS BROKEN SO IT IS A RESOLVING WHEEL OF WHEN YOU ARE OUT OF PROJECT AND HOW YOU PIVOT OFF OF THAT.  $80 A CASE.  WHAT WAS IT BEFORE?  28. AROUND THAT. EGGS THE SAME, AROUND $22 A CASE, 78.  STRUGGLING TO KEEP OPEN.  CLOSED ON TUESDAY. IT COST US MORE TO STAY OPEN THEN TO SHUT DOWN.

OUR JOB IS AS MUCH TO LISTEN, NOT TO PREACH BUT IF YOU TURN THE CHANNEL, YOU SHOULD BE CARING ABOUT DEMOCRACY JANUARY 6TH OVER RACHEL TALKING ABOUT OTHER THINGS. RACHEL: I LOVE TALKING TO PEOPLE. I WILL GIVE MSNBC CREDIT, THEY SENT JEN PSAKI OUT, SHE KNOCKED ON THE DOOR WITH A PRO-ABORTION ACTIVIST, WENT TO THE DOOR OF A VOTER IN THE VOTER SET I'M WORRIED ABOUT INFLATION AND I KNOW THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR BUT THAT IS WHAT I CARE ABOUT, THE PRICE OF THINGS. SHE PLAYED THAT TO HER CREDIT, NOT EDIT THAT OUT OF HER PACKAGE BUT WE TALK TO PEOPLE, INFLATION, CRIME, THE BORDER, WOKE CRAZY THINGS IN THEIR KIDS SCHOOLS. WILL: WE BROUGHT THE ROAD INTO THE STUDIO. WE HAD A TOWN HALL ON \"FOX AND FRIENDS,\" INTERESTING TO HEAR SEVERAL LIFELONG DEMOCRATS SAY WHY THEY HAVE OR ALREADY WERE -- WILL SOON WILL VOTE REPUBLICAN IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. WHAT CHANGED THEM? SOMETIMES AFTER 40 YEARS VOTING DEMOCRATS. IT IS CLEAR THIS IS A WAVE ELECTION, IT IS CLEAR THIS IS AN ELECTION THAT COULD CHANGE THE MAP FOR QUITE SOME TIME. WE WILL HIT THE ROAD AGAIN, IN PENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSIN, FLORIDA, \"FOX AND FRIENDS\" WILL BRING PEOPLE TO THE STUDIO THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND INTO MONDAY AS WE HEAR FROM YOU BUT NOW WE HEAR FROM THE HOST OF UNFILTERED WITH THE BAN -- DAN BONGINO WHO WAS WITH STEVE.  I SAID SOMETHING ON MY RADIO SHOW AND IT WAS QUITE A SCENE. TO BE AMONG THOSE PEOPLE, THIS INFLATION THING IS SO IMPORTANT. I LOVE ECONOMICS BUT REMEMBER, KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES DOMINATE POLITICS. THE MOST KITCHEN TABLE ISSUE OF ALL IS INFLATION BECAUSE IT RESTRICTS ACCESS TO RESOURCES, FOOD, GASOLINE, DOCTORS TIME, YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND MONEY TO DO IT THAT IS THE MOST KITCHEN TABLE ISSUE OF ALL. THIS IS WHY DEMOCRATS ARE IN TROUBLE. IT IS A LOCAL ISSUE, YOUR WALLET, IT IS IN YOUR PANTS POCKET THE SECOND POINT IS REMEMBER THE AXIOMATIC TRUTH OF POLITICS, YOU RAN FOR OFFICE AND I DID TOO. IF YOU HAVEN'T SAID IT YOU KNOW IT, THE MOST DAMAGING POLITICAL NARRATIVES TO A PARTY OR CANDIDATE ARE THOSE THAT CHANGE YOUR PREEXISTING NOTION OF WHO THAT PERSON OR PARTY WAS. WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT WITH THE CORE DEMOCRATIC BASE, WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO TELL PEOPLE THEY ARE THE REAL RACISTS, THE ONES THAT DON'T CARE ABOUT THE LITTLE GUY, THE ONES KEEPING YOUR KID OUT OF A GOOD SCHOOL AND WE HAVEN'T CRACKED IT, THEY CRACKED IT THEMSELVES. INFLATION AND CRIME COMPLETELY EVISCERATED THIS DEMOCRAT IDEAS THEY HAVE BEEN TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEY CARE FOR THE LITTLE GUY BECAUSE IT IS THE LITTLE GUY GETTING HIS ASS KICKED AND GETS ROBBED AND THE LITTLE GUY WHO CAN'T FILL UP HIS GAS TANK AND HE SEES THE DEMOCRAT IN CHARGE OF HIS AREA, THEY ARE THE ONES WHO EVISCERATED, WE DIDN'T, THEY DID. WILL: THE TEACHERS UNION STATED ON THEIR SIDE AS WELL. YOU BROUGHT UP THE WORD INFLATION. THIS IS A WORD THAT JOY REID HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THAT.  IT IS INTERESTING REPUBLICANS ARE DOING SOMETHING THEY DON'T NORMALLY DO WHICH IS NOT USE THE COMMON TONGUE TO DO ON THEIR CAMPAIGNS LIKE THEY DO WITH CRIME. WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS THEY'VE TAUGHT PEOPLE THE WORD INFLATION. MOST PEOPLE NEVER USED THE WORD IN THEIR LIVES ARE USING IT NOW BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN TAUGHT IT INCLUDING ON TV, NEWSPAPERS, THEY HAVE BEEN TAUGHT THIS WORD.  DEMS HAVE TAUGHT US PLENTY OF WORDS LIKE BANKRUPTCY, INSOLVENCY AND MULTIPLE STAB WOUNDS BUT I AM BETTING JOY WILL LEARN TWO NEW WORDS TUESDAY, RED WAVE. HOPE IT DOESN'T GO OVER HER HEAD. PETE: IT IS THE DEMS WHO USUALLY CHANGE WORDS FOR THEIR OWN POLITICAL BENEFIT. SHAME ON YOU FOR TEACHING PEOPLE ABOUT INFLATION.  WORDS AND STUFF. REMEMBER THE DOPEY RICK WILSON HIT ON CNN WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT RUDE REPUBLICAN VOTERS, MAYBE HE SHOULD ADDRESS JOY REID. THIS HAS TO BE THE GREATEST SELF OWN IN THE HISTORY OF CABLE TELEVISION. A SUPPOSEDLY BRILLIANT LIBERAL SO MUCH SO, SHE'S A THOUGHT LEADER ON A COMPETITOR CHANNEL NO ONE WATCHES AND SHE GOES ON THE AIR AND ADMITS THEY NEVER HEARD OF INFLATION BEFORE REPUBLICANS MENTIONED IT? KEEP IN MIND THE CHARLIE BROWN ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ECONOMICS CONTAINS THE WORD INFLATION IN THE OPENING PARAGRAPH BUT THIS IS HOW DUMB THE LEFT IS. WE HAVE ONLY BEEN WARNING ABOUT HYPERINFLATION AND INFLATION FOR YEARS, THE LEFT SET I GOT THIS CRAZY IDEA, WE ARE IN A SUPPLY-CHAIN CRISIS SO WE CAN'T GET A LOT OF STUFF. MONEY IS USED TO BUY STUFF SO LET'S PRINT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE IN MONEY TO CHASE STUFF WE ARE NOT MAKING. THE THIRD KEY TO THIS, LET'S PAY PEOPLE TO STAY HOME SO THEY DON'T MAKE MORE STUFF TO ABSORB THE MONEY AND THEN HAVE JOY REID TELL PEOPLE NONE OF THIS IS HAPPENING, THE REPUBLICANS JUST INVENTED THE WORD YESTERDAY. IF THIS IS YOUR BATTLE PLAN FOR TUESDAY, I AM SERIOUS, GET READY FOR STATES LIKE CONNECTICUT, COLORADO AND NEW HAMPSHIRE TO BE LOOKING AT POTENTIAL GOP SENATORS BECAUSE IT WILL BE LIKE REMEMBER THE DEEP IMPACT DISASTER MOVIE? THAT IS THE RED WAVE TSUNAMI THAT WILL COME ASHORE IF THEY ARE GOING TO STICK WITH THIS NARRATIVE UNTIL TUESDAY. RACHEL: LET'S CONSTRICT AMERICAN ENERGY. LET'S WAGE A WAR ON MODERN LIFE, MAKE IT HARDER TO PUT GAS IN YOUR CAR, CONSTRICTING ENERGY WILL CAUSE MORE INFLATION. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY THINK PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID THEY CAN'T FIGURE THAT OUT.  THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT FOREVER. ON MY PODCAST AND LISTEN TO THE -- I EXPLAINED IT ON MY PODCAST, THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THIS FOR A LONG TIME BECAUSE THE MEDIA PROVIDED AND ASSIST, TELL YOU TAX COSTS COST THE GOVERNMENT A BUNCH OF REVENUE. YOU CAN GO TO THE TREASURY REVENUE TABLES AND FIND OUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN WITH THE REAGAN AND BUSH YEARS. NO ONE WILL DO THAT SO THEY BELIEVE IT, REAGAN TAX CUTS COST US A LOT OF MONEY. TWICE AS MUCH MONEY. LIBERALS CAN LOOK THAT UP. THAT'S A FACTOR. THE ISSUE WITH GAS PRICES, INFLATION, THE MEDIA WASN'T ABLE TO HIDE THIS. THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO TELL SOMEONE GAS PRICES ARE CHEAPER SINCE PRESIDENT BIDEN TOOK OFFICE BECAUSE EVERY THREE OR FOUR DAYS YOU ARE STICKING A PUMP IN YOUR CAR, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK ANYTHING UP OR AN OP-ED PIECE, YOU SEE IT YOURSELF AND THE FACT THE MEDIA AND THE LEFT ARE SLAPPING PEOPLE IN THE FACE SAYING THESE AREN'T THE DROIDS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS PASSING THEM OFF. IS THAT CLEAR? THE LEFT IS SO FAR UNDERWATER AND THE FACT THAT BIDEN CAN 'T DO A COURSE CORRECTION AND HAVE A SISTER SOLDIER MOMENTS LIKE BILL CLINTON SPEAKS TO THE POLITICAL INEPTITUDE OF THIS GUY, HE HAS 0 POLITICAL SKILLS FOR THIS JOB AND HIS ADVISERS ARE THE DUMBEST PEOPLE I HAVE EVER SEEN. HE NEEDS A DICK MORRIS. RACHEL: ARE THEY DONE OR IS THIS INTENTIONAL? THE PEOPLE RUNNING PRESIDENT BIDEN'S GOVERNMENT ARE NOT DONE. I THINK THIS IS INTENTIONAL, THEY WANT TO IMPOVERISH PEOPLE AND MAKE THEM MORE DEPENDENT.  THE ANSWER IS ONE OF THOSE BOTH OF THOSE ANSWERS, SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE HEDGING, THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DESTROY THIS COUNTRY, THE ANTI-GROWTH CROWD, THE BIG LEFT FAR LEFT DONORS AND ACTIVIST GROUPS, THAT IS INTENTIONAL. THEY WANT A SMALLER POPULATION D GROWTH ENVIRONMENT, LOOK AT THE GREAT RESET STUFF. I DO A MONOLOGUE ON IT ON MY SHOW. THEY WANT A WORLD WHERE YOU ARE POOR. THERE ADAGE IS YOU WILL OWE NOTHING AND YOU WILL RENT EVERYTHING AND YOU WILL RENT IT FROM THEM MAKING THEM RICH. IS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, THEY ARE JUST DUMB. I THINK THEY LISTEN TO THESE FAR LEFTIES AND THINK THERE IS A POLITICAL AVENUE FOR THIS IF THEY YELL LOUD ENOUGH AND THEY KEEP YELLING AT PEOPLE, FASCIST HIMAGA, GREEN NEW DEAL, AND WHATEVER AND THEY THINK EVERYBODY IS GOING TO BUY IT WHICH SAYS TO ME YOU ARE JUST POLITICALLY STUPID. BILL CLINTON'S TEAM GOT IT. THE GUY WAS DOING A STING IN THE OVAL OFFICE AND GOT REELECTED. HE LEFT OFFICE ALMOST 60% APPROVAL DESPITE IN THE OVAL OFFICE -- HIS TEAM UNDERSTOOD THERE WAS A MIDDLE PORTION OF AMERICA THEY COULD INTERCEPT, BIDEN'S TEAM IS SINCERELY JUST STUPID. THEY CANNOT DIVORCE THEMSELVES FROM THE AOC CORY BUSH BERNIE SANDERS CROWD. THEY CAN'T DO IT. PETE: DEDICATED POLITICALLY INEPT, GREAT WAY TO BREAK IT DOWN. UNFILTERED TONIGHT AT 9:00 PM.  I HEART TUTOR DIXON ADDING EXCLUSIVE ON STEPHEN COLBERT THING WHO SAID ONE OF OUR VOTERS WAS FAKE.

I USE THEIR OWN WORDS FOR ALL THE FACT CHECKERS OUT THERE YOU CAN FACT CHECK THAT.

NEVADA, SENDING THEIR ALL-STARS IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE, IT IS A TOSSUP AND THE SENATE RACE IN NEVADA BETWEEN MASTO K AND DAVID VALADAO, JENNY CLARK, ARIZONA VOTER, MOTHER OF 5, FOUNDER OF LOVE YOUR SCHOOL. LET ME START WITH YOU, THE WORD I USED, FORMER DEMOCRAT. I'M CURIOUS, WHY THAT IS AND WHEN THAT CHANGED?  I SWITCHED IN 2015 BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE THE DANGEROUS PROTESTS THAT WERE OCCURRING, I DIDN'T LIKE HOW PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS VERY DIVISIVE AT THE TIME AND I SAW THE ECONOMY WAS NOT GOING THE RIGHT WAY, THEY DEFUNDED THE MILITARY AT THAT TIME BUT THEY DIDN'T CALL IT DEFUNDING, THEY CALLED IT BUDGET CUTS.

SHARE WITH US HOW YOU WILL BE VOTING.  I WILL NOT SHARE THAT ON NATIONAL NEWS BUT I WILL TELL YOU IS PARENTS IN ARIZONA CARE ABOUT THREE THINGS, INFLATION, THE BORDER AND EDUCATION AND I THINK ANYONE TALKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS AS WE HEAD INTO TUESDAY IS WHAT I CARE ABOUT AND PARENTS LIKE ME CARE ABOUT IN OUR STATE.

I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN ARIZONA, THE BORDER IS AN ISSUE NOT JUST FOR ARIZONANS BUT ALL AMERICANS, ALL THE PARENTS I CONNECT WITH. I HAVE 5 KIDS. IT WAS ALWAYS EXPENSIVE WHEN WE WENT TO THE GROCERY STORE BUT NOW WHEN I GO TO THE GROCERY STORE I GO THIS CAN'T BE RIGHT, THESE ARE THE THINGS ON MY MIND AND THE MINDS  AND THE MIND OF OTHER PARENTS LIKE ME.

PAT HARRIGAN, HIS PARENTS, THEIR HOME HAD A BULLET FLY THROUGH THEIR WINDOW WHICH WAS A WINDOWS THAT WAS ONLY A FEW FEET FROM WHERE HARRIGAN'S KIDS WERE SLEEPING AT THEIR GRANDPARENTS HOUSE. YOU HEARD NOTHING, NO MENTION OF THIS ON CNN, MSNBC. AS OF LAST NIGHT. THE ONLY COVERAGE OF THIS INCIDENT AIRS ON THE FOX NEWS CHANNEL. PETE: PAT HARRIGAN'S OPPONENT, OUTSIDE THE HOUSE THE DAY BEFORE OR MORNING OF, TALKING ABOUT LEE ZELDIN OR POLITICAL VIOLENCE, PAUL PELOSI AND CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATES KIDS GET SHOT OUT, THEY ARE SAYING THIS IS A CANDIDATE'S PARENTS HOUSE, NO COVERAGE AT ALL. RACHEL: SO MANY QUESTIONS WHAT HAPPENED, PAT HARRIGAN TALKING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.  THIS IS OUT OF THE BLUE FOR THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. AS A FORMER GREEN BERET I AM USED TO GETTING SHOT AT. I'M OKAY WITH GETTING SHOT AT. I'M NOT OKAY WITH MY FAMILY GETTING SHOT AT. IT IS ANOTHER LEVEL. WHEN YOU TAKE THE TOTALITY OF WHAT HAPPENED ACROSS THIS CAMPAIGN WITH THE LIES AND DEMONIZATION OF MY CHARACTER, NONE OF IT ADDS UP, FOLKS JUST DON'T HAVE BULLETS PASSING THROUGH THEIR WINDOWS AT 11:00 AT NIGHT WHEN THEY ARE WATCHING TELEVISION WHILE THERE -- MY KIDS ARE SITTING AT THEIR HOUSE. THE ODDS ON THAT ARE JUST LOW.  TALKING ABOUT THE YARDS, ONE THING WE DON'T KNOW, THAT IT WAS A TARGETED SHOOTING. LEE ZELDIN'S HOUSE WAS THE TARGET OF A SIMILAR INCIDENT ALTHOUGH IT ENDED UP BEING RANDOM BIT OF GUNFIRE BUT HARRIGAN WAS ON THE SHOW YESTERDAY, LAYS OUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES. HE WAS THE RECIPIENT OF A CREDIBLE DEATH THREAT, HIS PARENTS DON'T LIVE IN A HIGH CRIME NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE YOU WOULD THINK THERE WOULD BE RANDOM SHOOTINGS AND IT IS A HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS RACE. THERE WAS SOMETHING WHERE HIS OPPONENT TALKED ABOUT HARRIGAN'S LAKE HOUSE. IT ADDS UP TO SOME LEVELS OF IMPROBABILITIES THAT IT IS TOTALLY RANDOM. RACHEL: NOT JUST IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO A DEMOCRAT THERE'S ALL THIS ATTENTION AS POINTED OUT, NOT ONE MENTION OF A CANDIDATE ON THE OTHER -- IT ALSO GOES BACK TO THE FBI AND WE LOOK AT THIS TO TEARS OF JUSTICE. YOU HAVE ABORTION CLINICS WHO HAVE OVER 70 ATTACKS INCLUDING MOLOTOV COCKTAILS AND NOTHING HAPPENS TO THOSE DOMESTIC TERRORIST GROUPS WHO ARE DOING THAT, PREGNANCY CENTERS, YOU SEE PREGNANCY CENTERS GETTING A TAX AT NOTHING HAPPENING. THE FBI STEALING AND KEEPING SECURITY FOOTAGE TO THE FBI TO INVESTIGATE AND IT IS TO TEARS, YOU SEE PRO-LIFERS, PROTESTING PEACEFULLY GETTING PICKED UP BY THE FBI IN THEIR HOMES IN RAIDS, THROWN CHARGES THAT COULD LAST FROM 11 YEARS IN JAIL. PEOPLE, ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALK ABOUT THE THREAT TO DEMOCRACY, I WAS HEARING, PEOPLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM BEING TARGETED AT CONSERVATIVES, AT TRUMP SUPPORTERS, PEOPLE WHO QUESTION THE ELECTION, PEOPLE WHO ARE PRO-LIFE, NOT JUST THE MEDIA BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT.

HATE TO THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN HERE. IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING. TWO LEADERS OF THE GROUP, TRUE THE VOTE, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT, WHO WE KNOW PERSONALLY IS A NICE AND SANE PERSON, BOTH WERE JAILED THIS WEEK BY A JUDGE IN TEXAS. WHAT DID THEY DO WRONG? THEY ALLEGED VOTER FRAUD IN THE LAST ELECTION BASED ON WHAT THEY SAY ARE CONFIDENCE SOURCES. IN RESPONSE, A SOFTWARE COMPANY SUED TRUE THE VOTE, BUT BECAUSE THE LEADERS OF TRUE THE VOTE WILL NOT REVEAL THEIR CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES, WHICH THEY'RE ENTITLED TO KEEP SECRET, BECAUSE THEY'RE CONFIDENTIAL SOURCES, AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS JOURNALISM, BECAUSE THEY'RE STICKING WITH THAT, THEY'RE IN JAIL TONIGHT FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT. THE CEO OF THE CONSULTING FIRM DIGITAL STRATEGY HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS CLOSELY AND JOINS US TO ASSESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON. WE'VE HAD KATHERINE ON THE SHOW. NOT A WACKO AT ALL. SHE'S A SOBER, SINCERE, SMART PERSON. HOW COULD SHE BE IN JAIL FOR EXERCISING HER FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT?  KATHERINE AND HER RESEARCH PARTNER GREG ARE IN JAIL TONIGHT FOR REFUSING TO DISCLOSE THE VOTING TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, THE NAMES OF THE RESEARCHERS WHO PROVIDED INFORMATION TO THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THAT RESULTED IN A CRIMINAL INDICTMENT OF THE CEO, THE MOST PROGRESSIVE DA IN THE COUNTRY, GEORGE GASCON ACTUALLY INDICTED YOU F FOR THE RECORDS F MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, INCLUDING THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS, HOME ADDRESSES, OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO SERVERS IN CHINA. THE RESEARCHERS DEVELOPED THE INFORMATION. KATHERINE ATTEMPTED TO GIVE IT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AT THE FBI, AND ELSEWHERE, AND WAS SUED FOR DOING THAT. WHEN THEY WERE SUED, THEY GOT A RETRAINING ORDER, ORDERING CATHERINE TO TURN OVER THE NAMES OF THE RESEARCHERS. CATHERINE AND GREG, WHO ARE VERY COURAGEOUS PEOPLE, SIMPLY REFUSED TO DO IT, AND AS A RESULT CATHERINE AND GREG ARE IN JAIL TONIGHT.  Tucker: YOU DESCRIBED THAT SO CLEARLY. BLESS YOU FOR THAT. WHERE ARE ALL THE CIVIL LIBERTARIANS LIBERALS WHO USED TO DEFEND HUMAN RIGHTS? HAS ANYONE SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THIS? THIS IS SO SHOCKING THIS COULD HAPPEN.  THE CIVIL LIBERTARIANS AND THE MAINSTREAM PRESS IS BASICALLY A FLOCK OF SHEEP THAT ARE EACH BLEEDING THE EXACT SAME TUNE, AND ALL THEY WANT TO DO ITS DENY ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF FRAUD IN ELECTIONS, THAT ANY CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT IS MET WITH NOTHING MORE THAN THREATS TO LIBERTY.  Tucker: YEAH. I MEAN, THEY SPENT THREE YEARS TELLING US THAT THE 2016 ELECTION WAS RIGGED, AND THEY SHORT-CIRCUITED THE ENTIRE U.S. GOVERNMENT BECAUSE OF RUSSIA. THAT WAS A LIE. NO ONE WAS EVER PUNISHED. NOW IF YOU PIPE UP, SAY I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE 2020 ELECTION, YOU GO TO JAIL. BRIAN, APPRECIATE YOU COMING ON TONIGHT. HOPE YOU COME BACK AND TELL US WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS SHOCKING VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, TUCKER.  Tucker: SO IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO LOSE BIG ON TUESDAY, AND THEY KNOW IT. THEY'RE PANICKING AS A RESULT OF THAT. AND THEY'VE GONE BASICALLY COMPLETELY NUTS. HERE'S CONGRESSMAN JIM CLYBURN OF SOUTH CAROLINA.  THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN A COUNTRY THAT FOLLOWS WHAT HAPPENED IN GERMANY IN THE EARLY '30s. THIS COUNTRY IS ON TRACK TO REPEAT WHAT HAPPENED IN GERMANY WHEN IT WAS THE GREATEST DEMOCRACY GOING, ELECTED A CHANCELLOR WHO THEN CO-OPED THE MEDIA, THAT THIS PAST PRES PRESIDENT, COINED THE PRESS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE, THAT IS A BUNCH OF CRAP, AND WE KNOW IT. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY.  Tucker: SO GERMANY WAS THE GREATEST GOVERNMENT EVER? REALLY? AND REPUBLICANS ARE NAZIS? IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHERE TO START. WE ASKED VICTOR DAVIS HANSON FROM THE HOOVER INSTITUTE TO JOIN US TONIGHT. PROFESSOR, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF ALL OF THIS?  IT'S NONSENSE. THE ONLY WAY WE CAN LOOK AT IT, TUCKER, WE HAVEN'T HAD 90 YEARS LEFT RECEIVING CONTROL OF GOVERNMENT, AND THEY HAVE THE CONGRESS AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH. IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE A BORDER THAT'S OPEN. THEY BLEW UP THE BORDER. IT'S NOT THEY'RE LETTING CRIMINALS OUT. THEY BLEW UP THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. NOT THAT THEY SHUT DOWN ANWAR. THEY BLEW UP THE IDEA OF SELF SUFFICIENCY AND ENERGY. THEY WON'T DEFEND IT. THEY WON'T SAY, WELL, WE GOT 3 MILLION ILLEGAL ALIENS, ISN'T THAT GREAT? NO, THEY WON'T TALK ABOUT IT. THEY WON'T CHANGE, BUILD A WALL REOPEN KEYSTONE. ALL THEY DO INSTEAD IS THEY HAVE A MANTRA, A TRIFECTA, SAYING NOT TO VOTE FOR -- IF YOU DON'T VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT, YOU'RE DESTROYING DEMOCRACY. EVERY WOMAN IN THE UNITED STATES HAS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION TILL BIRTH, AND DONALD TRUMP AND HALF THE COUNTRY ARE FASCIST. ONLY TWO THINGS WE'VE ENDURED, WE LAB RATS, THEY'VE BROUGHT PEOPLE TOGETHER, A NEW ECUMENICAL MOVEMENT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN MALES, HISPANICS, THE WHITE WORKING CLASS THAT DETEST THESE BICOASTAL  ELITES. JUSTTHIS HAS CREATED A CONSENSUI HAVEN'T SEEN IN MY LIFETIME, AND WE'LL BE SHOCKED NEXT TUESDAY WHEN IT ROARS. THEY'RE NOT READY FOR IT, AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE PAN PICKING. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.  Tucker: I'VE BEEN A COASTAL ELITE MY WHOLE LIFE, AND I COULDN'T HAVE MORE CONTEMPT FOR THEM. I MEAN THAT FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. SINCE YOU'RE A HISTORIAN, YOU THINK THIS WILL BE A REALIGNMENT NEXT TUESDAY?  I DO. I THINK WE PAID A HELLUVA PRICE TO PUT UP FOR TWO YEARS WITH THIS INSANITY, BUT THERE WILL BE GOOD OUT OF IT. PEOPLE SAW IN THE RAW SOCIALISM, AND THEY DON'T WANT ANY PART OF IT, AND IT WILL BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER. IT'S GOING TO BE A REVOLT AGAINST THESE BICOASTAL SNARKY ELITES. NOBODY LIKES THEM. WE'LL FIND OUT ON TUESDAY JUST HOW MUCH WE DON'T LIKE THEM.  Tucker: MAKING ME HAPPY JUST SAYING THAT! JOE BIDEN JUST ISSUED A DECLARATION ON ENERGY, PROMISING TO SHUT DOWN COAL PLANTS ACROSS AMERICA. OKAY, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TOO MUCH ENERGY. THAT'S NEXT. 20221105005432.785|20221105005940.157",

THE POLITICS AVERAGE IN THE POLLS IN THIS RACE, AND IT IS SPLIT BY ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF, BUT IT'S RCP TODAY MOVE COLORADO SENATE TO CLEAN DEMOCRAT TO TOSS UP, WE ARE STILL AT LEAN DEMOCRAT, BUT A DISCLOSING, WHAT IS HER CLOSING CLOSING ARGUMENT?  I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT AFFECT WORKING AMERICANS IN COLORADO, THAT'S WHAT IS MOVING THE NEEDLE, WE ARE ON SPOT AND TALKING ABOUT RECORD INFLATION AND TALKING ABOUT RECORD CRIME HERE, GAS PRICES THAT ARE OVER-THE-TOP, DEEP SOUL IS STILL OVER $5 HERE IN COLORADO, THAT'S WHAT MATTERS TO WORKING AMERICANS AND THAT'S WHY THE NEEDLE IS MOVING. WE FEEL WE BUILT A HUGE COALITION. WE ARE MARCHING FORWARD AND GOING TO GET OVER THE FINISH LINE HERE ON TUESDAY.  Bret: WE LOOK AT CANDIDATES FINAL ADS AND A SLIVER, THIS IS YOUR CLOSING AD.  MICHAEL BENNET IS THE YES YES-MAN. JOE O'DEA IS HIS OWN MAN, SECURING THE BORDER, TOUGH ON CRIME, ATTACKING INFLATION.  Bret: COLORADO HAS BEEN ELUSIVE FOR REPUBLICANS, IT'S BLUISH, PURPLE TO BLUISH, YOU THINK YOU CAN CHANGE THAT?  WE HAVE BUILT A HUGE COALITION THEN IT'S TRUMP SUPPORTERS, G.O.P. SUPPORTERS, INDEPENDENTS AND DEMOCRATS CAME FROM A RALLY UP IN STEAMBOAT, COLORADO. HAD FIVE DEMOCRATS WALK UP TO ME THAT SAID THAT THEY NEVER VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN BEFORE, VOTING WITH US BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT I AM SPOT ON AND WHAT NEEDS TO GET DONE IN THE U.S. SENATE TO REPRESENT WORKING AMERICANS. MICHAEL BENNET HAS DROPPED THE BALL AND TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE AND HAS NOT GOTTEN ANYTHING DONE FOR OUR STATE AND PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT.  Bret: HERE IS SENATOR BENNET TO ADD TO YOUR LAST DEBATE, LISTEN TO CHARGES AGAINST YOU.  PEOPLE LIKE JOE IS A, AND GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER. NOT PAYING HER TAXES, AND JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR, SAID HE SUPPORTS NO GUN LAWS BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE AS A SOCIETY AND IT'S AGAINST THE RED FLAG OF WHAT WE HAVE IN COLORADO. I DON'T THINK THAT JOE O.J. SHOULD BE IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM WHEN SHE HAS TO MAKE THAT DECISION.  Bret: TALKING ABOUT ABORTION, YOUR RESPONSE TO THOSE CHARGES?  HE IS JUST MAKING IT UP AS HE GOES ON TRYING TO LINK ME TO ANYTHING HE CAN. HE FAILED TO TALK ABOUT THE RECORD INFLATION AND THAT HE CAUSED, AND WAS THE DECIDING VOTE ON THE $1.9 TRILLION RESCUE PLAN THAT SENT THIS ECONOMY INTO A TAILSPIN, I ASKED HIM ABOUT IT AND HE SAID CRICKETS. DO NOT HAVE ANY ANSWERS AND I SAID DID YOU REGRET THE SPENDING? NOTHING AT ALL. HE DOES NOT REGRET IT AND IF YOU WANT SIX MORE YEARS, THAT'S WHAT WE WILL GET WITH MICHAEL BENNET.  Bret: THEY HAVE USED THE ABORTION ISSUE SEVERAL TIMES, EXPLAIN YOUR STANCE ON ABORTION?  I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR, I BELIEVE THAT BELONGS BETWEEN A WOMAN AND HER DOCTOR, WITH THE EXCEPTIONS OF RAPE,, LIFE OF THE MOTHER, MEDICAL NECESSITY, THAT IS BETWEEN A WOMAN AND HER DOCTOR AND I WILL VOTE THAT WAY. MICHAEL BENNET HAS BEEN VOTING FOR ELECTIVE ABORTION INCLUDING THE MOMENT OF BIRTH AND WANTS TO USE TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO PAY FOR IT. THAT'S EXTREME.  Bret: YOU HAD RON DeSANTIS ENDORSE YOUR CAMPAIGN. OBVIOUSLY THE FORMER PRESIDENT HAS NOT DONE THAT AND HAS SAID SOME THINGS. IT'S A TIGHT ROPE, THE EFFORT TO NAVIGATE THE SLIM PATH TO VICTORY HAS BEEN A CASE STUDY AND WHAT IT IS LIKE TO GET HAMMERED FROM BOTH THE RIGHT AND THE LEFT AND TO TRY TO CHOOSE EVERY WORD WITH THE UTMOST DELICACY. HAVE YOU BEEN CHOOSING THOSE WORDS WITH DELICACY?  LOOK, I AM A CONTRACTOR, NOT A POLITICIAN. I SAID WHAT I SAID AND I WILL SPEAK MY OWN MIND. I AM AN INDEPENDENT THINKER AND I'M ABOUT COLORADO AND ABOUT WORKING AMERICANS HERE IN COLORADO THAT NEED A BREAK AND A BREAK FROM THE RECORD INFLATION, THEY NEED A BREAK FROM THIS RECORD CRIME THAT MICHAEL BENNET AND JOE BIDEN HAVE PUT UPON US.  Bret: DO YOU THINK INFLATION IS THE BIGGEST THING THAT IS DRIVING YOUR RACE? YOUR SUPPORT?  WORKING AMERICANS ARE TALKING ABOUT THE COST OF GROCERIES IN THE COST OF GAS, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT THE COST OF RENT. WE ARE JUST GETTING OUR FIRST HEATING BILLS, THEY ARE UP 30% HERE IN COLORADO AND PEOPLE CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE OF THAT. WE HAVE LOST 10% OF OUR BUYING POWER AND THEY HAVE TO MAKE TOUGH CHOICES AND THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR U.S. SENATOR IN NOVEMBER.  Bret: CLOSING WITH THE THREATS TO DEMOCRACY AND ELECTION DENIAL, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT AND HOW EFFECTIVE OR INEFFECTIVE THAT MESSAGING IS?  LOOK, THE ONLY THREAT TO DEMOCRACY IS SIX MORE YEARS OF MICHAEL BENNET HERE IN COLORADO BACKING UP JOE BIDEN'S PLAN FOR OUR COUNTRY. IT IS FAILING. IF YOU LOOK BACK 22 MONTHS AGO, WE HAD TO DOLLAR AND $0.38 GAS, WE HAD $3.50 DIESEL, AND THE ECONOMY WAS BOOMING, WAGES WERE GROWING. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT REMEMBER THAT TIME, AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING BACK TO WHEN WE REPLACE MICHAEL BENNET AND I AM YOUR NEXT U.S. SENATOR.  Bret: WE WILL FOLLOW THE RACE CLOSELY, THANK YOU FOR OUR TIME. AND THE MIDTERM PANEL LOOKING AT THE ELECTION AND WE WILL BOUNCE AROUND THE COUNTRY. FIRST WITH SOME OF OUR FOX AFFILIATES AROUND THE COUNTRY TONIGHT.

WE WILL CHECK IN WITH THE DIFFERENT RACES AROUND THE COUNTRY WITH REPORTERS COVERING, LET'S BRING IN THE PANEL TON TONIGHT. AND POLITICAL REPORTER FOR THE HILL AND CHRIS RYAN, NEW HAMPSHIRE TODAY, IHEARTRADIO HOST. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE. I WANT TO START WITH YOU IN THIS WASHINGTON SENATE RACE WHERE THE RCP AVERAGE HAS AN INCUMBENT AT 49.3 AND THE CHALLENGER AT 46.3, AND YOU CAN SEE THE BAR GRAPH WHERE THE RACE HAS CHANGED AND REALLY AS IT COMES TO THE END, GETTING TIGHT AND IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE, JASON, IS IT REAL ON THE GROUND?  IT IS ABSOLUTELY REAL AND WHAT IS DRIVING HIS INDEPENDENT VOTERS. YOU ARE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE MOST RECENT POLLS AND THAT'S WHERE THE SHIFTS ARE, AND WHEN YOU WANT TO WIN AS A REPUBLICAN STATEWIDE IN WASHINGTON STATE, YOU ARE GOING HAVE TO OVER PERFORM OUTSIDE OF KING COUNTY, THAT'S WHERE SEATTLE IS AND GET 40% OF THE VOTE AND ACTUALLY HAVE A SHOT, BUT NOT GOING TO WIN IN THAT COUNTY IF SHE GETS 30 OR 35% AND OVER PERFORMS EVERYWHERE ELSE, THAT'S HOW SHE WINS. AND SHE IS TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT PARTICULARLY ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE STATE PEOPLE REALLY CARE ABOUT. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT INFLATION IN THE ECONOMY ALONG WITH CRIME, THAT'S HOW SHE IS GETTING THIS KIND OF MOMENTUM IN THERE IS ACTUAL ENERGY ON THE GROUND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME IT FEELS LIKE A REPUBLICAN CAN ACTUALLY WIN THIS.  Bret: AND ONE THING, JASON, WHAT IS THE CLOSING ARGUMENT FOR EACH? THE THREATS TO DEMOCRACY AND ABORTION, HOW IS IT CLOSE?  TALKING TO THE SEATTLE VOTER, ALL ABOUT ABORTION, YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE YOUR RIGHT TO ACCESS ABORTION AND DEMOCRACY IS ON THE LINE. AND TALKING ABOUT GETTING THE CRIME SITUATION UNDER CONTROL AND THEN BRING IT DOWN THE COST OF JUST EVERYDAY LIFE.  Bret: LET'S HEAD TO VIRGINIA, AND JULIA, I TELL YOU, I LOOK AT THESE THREE HOUSE RACES AND A LITTLE INSIDE BASEBALL ON ELECTION NIGHT, THESE THREE HOUSE RACES VIRGINIA TENN AND VIRGINIA SEVEN ARE GOING TO BE INDICATIONS. THIS IS SPAM BERGER, VEGA, THIS IS WEST END. FAIR TO SAY THAT THESE ARE THE CANARIES IN THE COAL MINE ON ELECTION NIGHT TO TELL US HOW THINGS ARE GOING?  ABSOLUTELY, BRET, STARTING IN THE SECOND DISTRICT I WOULD SAY ALAIN GLORIA IS THE MOST VULNERABLE DEMOCRAT OUT OF THESE THREE INCUMBENT DEMOCRATS WHO WERE SELECTED AND THEN 2018 BLUE WAVE AND A BINGO IN CONGRESS FOR A WHILE NOW. IN THE DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA BEACH AREA FAVORS REPUBLICANS ON TOP OF THAT HER OPPONENT JEN KIGGINS HAS BEEN TAPPING INTO THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT FAVORABLE TO REPUBLICANS, SO TALK ABOUT THOSE ISSUES THAT WE MENTIONED BEFORE, CRIME AND THE ECONOMY. MOVING UP NORTH TO THE SEVENTH DISTRICT WITH SPAM BERGER I WOULD SAY IT IS A BIT SAFER THAN THE DISTRICT MOVED CLOSER TO WASHINGTON, D.C., AND FURTHER AWAY FROM RICHMOND, SO DEMOCRATIC LEANING VOTERS AT THE SAME TIME SHE IS STILL CONSIDERED SOMEWHAT VULNERABLE. WE KNOW THAT PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE IS SOMEWHAT OF A BLUE STRONGHOLD, HOWEVER, THERE ARE RURAL AREAS THAT COULD LEAN RED, AND IN THE TENTH DISTRICT I WOULD SAY JENNIFER WEXTON IS THE SAFEST OUT OF THESE THREE. AND IF THEY GET HER, THAT WOULD BE AN INDICATION OF A VERY STRONG RED WAVE, THE DISTRICT IS LOCATED JUST OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON, D.C., AND IT IS BALLOON LEANING, IN A WAY THAT FAVORS DEMOCRATS AS WELL. SO I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT THESE RACES BECAUSE LENNY ONKEN PERFORMED RELATIVELY WELL FOR A REPU REPUBLICAN IN SF THESE DISTRICTS.  I HAVE IT THAT VIRGINIA GOES G.O.P., AND VIRGINIA SEVEN GOES IT'S A GOOD NIGHT, VIRGINIA TEN GOES TO THE G.O.P., IT'S A REALLY, REALLY GOOD NIGHT FOR THE G.O.P. ALL RIGHT, LET'S HEAD OUT TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND THE SENATE RACE WHICH IS ANOTHER ONE WHICH HAS REALLY CLOSE IN THE FINAL DAYS, NOW CATCHING UP TO THE INCUMBENT MAGGIE HASSAN AND THAT AGAIN ON THAT BAR CHART ON THAT GRAPH, RATHER IT IS CONVERGING RIGHT AT ELECTION DAY, WHAT IS THE LATEST?  YES, YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT AND THIS WAS THE PREFERRED CANDIDATE FOR MAGGIE HASSAN, THE D.C. PUT IN MONEY IN FAVOR OF BULLOCK AND HELPED HIM OVER THE FINISH LINE, BUT HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO CLOSE. THE GRANITE STATE IS VERY FINICKY, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO ECONOMIC ISSUES AND THERE IS A FEELING THAT MAGGIE HASSAN HAS TIED YOURSELF UP A LITTLE BIT TOO TIGHTLY TO JOE BIDEN AND DON BULLOCK IS MORE OF AN INDEPENDENT. HE HAS HIS NEGATIVES AND POSITIVES, BUT OVERALL IT FEELS LIKE THIS RACE HAS TIGHTENED AND HE DOES HAVE SOME MOMENTUM. THE QUESTION IS WILL HE BE ABLE TO GET IT OVER THE FINISH LINE? IS IT THAT 1.7% THAT YOU HAVE OR MORE LIKE 3% AND A LITTLE BIT TOO FAR OFF THE RACE? THAT'S WHAT WE WILL FIND OUT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. BUT CERTAINLY OUTPERFORMED AND BARELY HAD ANY MONEY AND HAS BEEN BUOYED BY A LOT OF D.C. THIRD-PARTY GROUPS, BUT DOES THE INCUMBENT HAVE ENOUGH TO HANG ON? IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THIS BREAKS DOWN ON ELECTION NIGHT.  Bret: AND CONGRESSIONAL RACE THERE, REPUBLICANS ARE POISED TO DO WELL?  SO, IN THE TWO CONGRESSIONAL RACES, IT'S A LITTLE BIT SAFER IN THAT ONE WILL PROBABLY GO WITH ANNIE CUSTER, WHAT WE WILL WATCH ON ELECTION NIGHT IS IF THIS RACE IS REALLY CLOSE, THE SENATE RACE MEANS THAT CAROLINE LEVEN HAS IN CD1 IF MAGGIE HASSAN IS ABLE TO WIN BY THREE OR FOUR COPERCENT, THAT MEANS THAT THEY SPLIT THE RACE AND IS GOING TO BE REALLY CLOSE, 11TH INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS BEEN VERY FIRM UNDER SUPPORT OF DONALD TRUMP. AND YOUR TYPICAL KIND OF MODERATES REPUBLICAN -- MODERATE DEMOCRAT BROKEN WITH THE PRESIDENT ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS AND IS TRYING TO HANG ON FOR DEAR LIFE HERE IN THE GRANITE STATE AND AS IT'S RENEWED ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  Bret: WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME, GREAT TO CHECK IN ON ALL THESE PLACES.  THANK YOU, BRET.  Bret: THE ALL-STAR PANEL WITH THE LIGHTNING ROUND, KEEP IT HERE. \u266a \u266a 20221104224636.107|20221104225045.090",

DO WE WANT TO HEAR ABOUT OPERA? OPRAH DECIDED TO ENDORSE -- GO AGAINST ENDORSING HER FRIEND DR. OZ. SHE SAID SHE WOULD VOTE FOR FETTERMAN INSTEAD.  I SAID IT WAS UP TO THE CITIZENS OF PENNSYLVANIA BUT I WILL TELL YOU THIS, IF I LIVED IN PENNSYLVANIA I WOULD'VE ALREADY CAST MY VOTE FOR JOHN FETTERMAN FOR MANY REASONS.  Dana: BILL HEMMER. HAS A CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENT EVER EFFECTED A BIG RACE LIKE THIS?  Bill: IS THIS STUMP THE ANCHOR TIME?  Dana: I TRIED TO GET THEM TO GO ALONG WITH ME BUT THEY WOULDN'T DO IT.  Bill: IT MIGHT TURN OUT EMBARRASSING. I'M SURE JESSE HAS GOT SOMETHING.  Jesse: I REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE IN HER KNEECAP GAME BUT I DO HAVE A LEGITIMATE QUESTION. WHEN THE POLLS CLOSE, WHEN DO THEY CLOSE? WHICH STATES CLOSE FIRST AND WHAT ARE THE INDICATORS THAT I NEED TO LOOK FOR TO TELL IF IT'S A WIN.  Bill: VIRGINIA, 7:00 EAST COAST TIME. THAT'S THE EASIEST ONE TO BREAK DOWN. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE DONE IT, TALKING ABOUT THIS, THE REASON IS THERE ARE THREE HOUSE RACES CONSIDERED TOSS UPS. KEY RACES TOO CLOSE TO CALL. VIRGINIA 2. NORFOLK. BOTH HAVE MILITARY RECORDS. REPUBLICANS THINK IT CAN BE THE BEGINNING OF A GOOD NIGHT FOR THEM ON TUESDAY NIGHT. VIRGINIA 7. ELAINE SPANN BERGER -- ABIGAIL SPANBERGER. WE DID THAT BEFORE. WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT ALL THREE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN IN THESE RACIST WON THEIR FIRST TERMS IN 2018. DEMOCRATS HAD A GREAT MIDTERM RUN ANOTHER UP FOR REELECTION. GOOD REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. THIS IS A DIFFERENT DISTRICT FOR ABIGAIL SPANBERGER. WE WILL GO OVER IT ON TUESDAY. I'M TALKING VERY FAST BECAUSE I WANT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING. IF REPUBLICANS ARE ABLE TO WIN IN THAT DISTRICT THEN YOU START LOOKING THE WAY IN YOUR THINKING HOW HIGH COULD THIS BEATS THAT IF THEY WIN VIRGINIA 10, THEN YOU REALLY START COUNTING THE FEET IN THE WAVE. IT'S A TALL HURDLE. I'M NOT SAYING IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT YOU ASKED ME FOR AN EARLY INDICATOR ON THE NIGHT. I LOOK AT VIRGINIA AND THOSE THREE RACES. VIRGINIA CLOSES AT 7:00 AND THEY COUNT QUICKLY.  Jesse: PERFECT.  Dana: HAROLD.  Harold: WHAT'S YOUR THINKING ON NEVADA? THE REASON I ASK. HE LOOKED LIKE, I THINK ADAM LAXALT IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE. HE WAS AHEAD FOR A WHILE. NOW IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S COME DOWN. SEEMS LIKE THE DEMOCRAT MIGHT BE AHEAD. ONE OF THOSE SEATS SEEMS TO BE EVENING OUT.  Bill: THE POLLING'S NECK AND NECK. SOME OF THE EARLY VOTING RETURNS INDICATE REPUBLICANS ARE COMING OUT DEMOCRATS LESS SO. THE FIRST LATINA IN SENATE HISTORY, SHE'S GOT THAT ON HER SIDE. ADAM LAXALT IS A PRETTY GOOD CANDIDATE. I WOULD SAY WINGBACK TO 2020 AS YOU LOOK AT NEVADA, CLARK COUNTY, LAS VEGAS, BIDEN WON THE COUNTY BY ALMOST 54%. 60% OF THE VOTING POPULATION IN NEVADA LIVE IN CLARK COUNTY. SOMETHING TO WATCH.  Judge Jeanine: BILL, I DIDN'T GO ALONG WITH THE KNEECAP IN EITHER. NEW YORK, 17TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. NEW YORK, VERY BLUE STATE AND YOU GOT THE HEAD OF THE DCCC.  Bill: WAS AMAZING, CAN YOU SEE THIS, KEY RACES. HOW LONG HAVE YOU LOOKED IN NEW YORK?  Judge Jeanine: MY WHOLE LIFE.  Bill: ONE, TWO, THREE 456-789-1011, 12 RACES WE ARE WATCHING IN NEW YORK. WHY IS THAT. HERE IS ONE, NEW YORK 17, IT'S A NEW DISTRICT FOR SEAN PATRICK MALONEY UP AGAINST A GOOD CANDIDATE, MIKE LAWLER. MALONEY RUNS THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN COMM COMMITTEE. REPUBLICANS HAVE SPENT MILLIONS ON THIS RAISE. G.O.P. WANTS TO TAKE THEM DOWN. DON'T KNOW IF THEY CAN. HUDSON RIVER VALLEY NORTH OF NEW YORK CITY, SOMETHING BOTH PARTIES HAVE BEEN WATCHING VERY CAREFULLY.  Dana: YOUR DISTRICT, JUDGE? I THOUGHT THAT WAS HER DISTRICT BUT IT'S NOT.  Bill: DO YOU LIVE IN 17?  Judge Jeanine: NO.  Bill: DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE?  Judge Jeanine: I LIVE IN WESTCHESTER. I RAN FIVE TIMES.  Dana: I WILL DO THE KNEE CAPPING. THIS ACTUALLY JUST HAPPENED IN THE COMMERCIAL BREAK WHEN YOU WENT UPSTAIRS. JESSE SAW A REAL CLEAR POLITICS HAS JUST MOVED TO COLORADO SENATE RACE TO A TOSS-UP. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THEM APPLES?  Bill: WHO DID?  Dana: RCP.  Bill: HE DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE, TWO COURSES SHOT, DEVELOPED A CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS, VERY SUCCESSFUL. HE PUT A LOT OF HIS OWN MONEY IN IT, HE HAS NOT BEEN IN POLITICS BEFORE. MICHAEL BENNET IS THE ESTABLISHMENT DEMOCRAT, HE'S TRYING TO GET ANOTHER ONE. O'DAY IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL REPUBLICAN. HE HAS, IN FAVOR OF CERTAIN ABORTION-RIGHTS, REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS FOR WOMEN. HE'S HAD A FEW THINGS TO SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, ET CETERA. YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THE STATE? THAT IS THE HURDLE THAT JOE O'DAY NEEDS TO CLIMB. BIDEN BY 14 POINTS TWO YEARS A AGO. IT'S A DEMOCRATIC STATE.  Dana: WHEN THEY MOVE IT TO A TOSS-UP, THAT'S A POSSIBILITY.  Bill: WITHIN THE MARGIN.  Dana: MORE KNEE CAPPING AHEAD. JUST KIDDING. DEMOCRATS MIGHT'VE TAKEN THIS KEYBOARDING GROUP FOR GRANTED AND IT COULD COST THEM DEARLY IN JUST FOUR DAYS. 20221104213454.074|20221104213845.155",

        "trs": " Martha: GEORGIA IS ON OUR LOSS OF TOSS-UPS. REALLY IMPORTANT SENATE RACE THERE. DEMOCRAT SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK'S LEAD OVER HERSCHEL WALKER HAS GONE FROM FIVE POINTS IN SEPTEMBER, NOT THAT LONG AGO, NOW DOWN TO ONE POINT BETWEEN THESE TWO IN THE VERY LATEST FOX NEWS POLL, WHICH WE JUST GOT A LOOK AT THE OTHER NIGHT. THOSE ARE FRESH NUMBERS. YOU HAVE 12% WHO ARE UNDECIDED IN THIS RACE. SO OF COURSE, THAT COULD MOVE THIS THING EITHER WAY AS WELL. AS IT'S ALL GOING TO HINGE ON TURNOUT TUESDAY IN THIS RACE. VOTERS SAY WHEN ASKED, WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO YOU. 38% SAY YEP, IT'S INFLATION AND HIGH PRICES. IT'S OVER ABORTION BY 20 POINTS. THAT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST STORIES OF THIS WHOLE ELECTION SEASON SO FAR. IF THESE POLLING NUMBERS DO BEAR OUT ON ELECTION DAY. SO IN MOMENTS, HE JUST SPRINTED IN HERE -- HE RUNS ACROSS THE COUNTRY LAWRENCE JONES. YOU CAN SEE WHY HE MIGHT BREAK INTO A SWEAT. HE HAS ARRIVED. THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS. WE'LL GIVE HIM A MOMENTS TO CATCH HIS BREATH. FIRST TO AISHAH HASNIE WHO IS LIVE IN NEWNAN, GEORGIA OUTSIDE OF ATLANTA. HIGH, AISHAH.  HI, MARTHA. YOU'RE RIGHT. INFLATION DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE IN YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN. IF YOUR A BUSINESS OWNER A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, YOU GETTING HIT HARD BY INFLATION. WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO BUSINESS OWNERS INCLUDING DARRELL PERRY WHO VOTED FOR REPUBLICAN HERSCHEL WALKER BECAUSE HE BLAME DEMOCRATS FOR THEIR SPENDING. HE RUN AS PEST CONTROL COMPANY IN CARTERSVILLE AND HAS LOST $50,000 TO $60,000 IN REVENUE BECAUSE OF THE RISING COST OF CHEMICALS AND HIGHER GAS PRICES. ON TOP OF THAT, HE'S LOSING CLIENTS, MARTHA, BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD HIS SERVICES ANYMORE.  THIS IS THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN. I AFFECTS MY BUSINESS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEY ALWAYS GET RID OF THE PEST CONTROL PEOPLE BECAUSE IF THEY HAVE TO FEED THEIR FAMILIES, YOU KNOW -- I DON'T BLAME THEM.  NOW, THE WRIGHTS, THAT OWN THE WRIGHT CUT SALON IN MONROE, GEORGIA, THEY'VE BEEN HIT HARD. THEY SAY PRICES HAVE DOUBLED AND DWINDLING CLIENTS LED TO AN EMPLOYEE LEAVING THE FULSON SALON. THE WRIGHTS VOTED FOR WARNOCK. THEY SAID THE DEMOCRATIC SPENDING LIKE COVID RELIEF WAS NEEDED.  IF IT'S IN THEIR POSITION, I WOULD HAVE DID IT, TOO. THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE I HEARD THE CRIES OF SO MANY PEOPLE SAYING WE NEED HELP. WE NEED HELP. SO WHAT DO YOU DO?  WHAT IS CLEAR, MARTHA, ON THE GROUND IN GEORGIA IS THAT THIS RACE ON TUESDAY IS A REFERENDUM OR DEMOCRATS AND THEIR ECONOMIC POLICIES. MARTHA?  Martha: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AISHAH HASNIE IN NEW NAN, GEORGIA TODAY. LAWRENCE JONES IS JUST BACK FROM GEORGIA. HE SPOKE TO VOTERS. \"LAWRENCE JONES CROSS-COUNTRY\" AIRS SATURDAYS AT 10:00 P.M. I JOKED ABOUT YOU RUNNING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU TALK TO PEOPLE.  I HAVE NEVER RUN ACROSS MIDTOWN MANHATTAN IN COWBOY BOOTS.  Martha: THANKS FOR BEING HERE ON TIME.  IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT, ME GOING TO THESE DIFFERENT STATES. ALTHOUGH THERE IS A SIMILAR TONE THAT INFLATION AND CRIME ARE THE TOP ISSUES, THE WAY TO DESCRIBE THOSE ISSUES AND HOW IT PERSONALLY IMPACTED THEM IS MUCH DIFFERENT. REMEMBER, GEORGIA WAS THE PLACE WHERE THEY CALLED IT JIM CROW 2.0. AS A RESULT, ATLANTA IS KNOWN AS THE MODERN DAY BLACK WALL. A LOT OF BLACK BUSINESSES THERE. THEY SAY IT WAS JIM CROW 2.0. THE ALL-STAR GAME LEFT THERE. YOU HAVE THIS PLACE STRUGGLING WITH A CRIPPLING ECONOMY. YOU TAKE THAT BUSINESS AWAY. THEY WERE VERY FIRED UP ABOUT THAT, MARTHA, WHEN I TALKED TO THEM.  Martha: THAT WAS A MOVE THAT WAS CRITICIZED AND STACEY ABRAMS IS RUNNING FOR GEORGIAN. THEY CALLED IT JIM CROW 2.0. SO FAR THEY HAVE ENORMOUS TURNOUT IN GEORGIA. THEY HAVE BROKEN RECORDS IN GEORGIA WITH THE TURNOUT, WHICH FEELS LIKE THE OPPOSITE OF VOTER SUPPRESSION. THIS IS TANIKA WHO YOU SPOKE WITH WHEN YOU SAT DOWN WITH SOME VOTERS. LET'S WATCH THIS.  THE ECONOMY IS SUCH -- ISN'T SUCH A BAD STATE UNTIL -- IF YOU RAN WITH ANYONE, IF OUR PRESIDENT CURRENTLY POLLED OR -- RAN WITH ANYBODY ON THE TRAIL, IT WOULD BE -- HOW DO YOU SEE THAT -- IT WOULD BE A [BLEEP] SHOW.  Martha: I WISH WE COULD ALL CARRY ONE OF THOSE. WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE-AWAY?  THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT THESE PANELS. THEY'RE NOT DEBATES. THEY'RE CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE THAT COME FROM ALL POLITICAL PERSUASIONS. OBVIOUSLY ALL HAD DEFENSES OF THEIR PARTY AND THEIR CANDIDATES. BUT THE ONE THING THAT THEY ALL AGREED WAS THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY, WE'RE NOT HEADING DOWN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. JOE BIDEN IS A FRAILING PRESIDENT. THIS IS A GUY THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED A LAME DUCK REALLY SOON. NO ONE IN THE PARTY IS HAPPY WITH HIM. THEY MAY MAKE EXCUSES FOR HIM BECAUSE THEY'RE PARTISANS, BUT NOBODY CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT THINGS ARE GOING WELL. YOU SAW THAT FROM TANIKA. SHE GOT TO A POINT WHERE SHE GOES I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN BOXED IN IN THIS CONVERSATION. YOU KNOW, YOU CAN BE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR PARTY AND STILL SAY YOUR CANDIDATE RIGHT NOW IS NOT THE BEST FOR THE COUNTRY. THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE FROM A LOT OF DEMOCRATS. THEY'RE DEMOCRATS AT THEIR HEART BUT MYSTIFIED WITH THESE PROGRESSIVE POLICIES THAT ARE TANKING THE COUNTRY. NOT JUST FROM A ECONOMIC STANDPOINT BUT YOU WANT TO RELEASE EVERYONE OUT SO THEY CAN REOFFEND AND HARM PEOPLE? IT'S HARD FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN LIFE-LONG DEMOCRATS BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR THE REPUBLICAN. AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY HAVE TO VOTE FOR WHAT IS BEST FOR THEIR FAMILY. THAT'S WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN GEORGIA. THE ONE THING THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE MINDFUL OF IS THE BLACK VOTE. WHEN I SAY THE BLACK VOTE, I MEAN THE BLACK MEN. THERE'S SOMETHING -- I'M NOT SAYING KEMP WILL GET 40% OF THE BLACK MALE VOTE. BUT THERE'S A POCKET OF THOSE BLACK VOTERS THAT ARE MALES THAT CARE ABOUT THE ECONOMY, CARE ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES AND CARE ABOUT THE CRIME. IF HE GETS 25 TO 30%, IT'S GAME OVER. IT'S GAME OVER.  Martha: HUGE.  AND WHAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM PEOPLE, POLITICAL INSIDERS -- HERSCHEL IS NOT DOING WELL AS KEMP. KEMP WAS THE GOVERNOR. HE MADE A LOT OF INROADS IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES. MAY BE KEMP THAT DRAGS HIM ACROSS. PEOPLE WON'T SWITCH PARTIES WHEN IT COMES TO THAT SENATE RACE.  Martha: FASCINATING. SO INTERESTING. YEAH, WALKER AND WARNOCK HAVE HAD NEGATIVES IN THEIR CAMPAIGN. WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE, THEY POINT OUT THINGS THAT THEY'RE ENSURE ABOUT, ABOUT EITHER ONE OF THEM. SO THE QUESTION IS DOES -- CAN KEMP PULL WALKER ACROSS. WATCH THAT BLACK VOTE NOT ONLY IN GEORGIA BUT IN STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHICH HAS SLOWLY BEEN INCHING MORE CONSERVATIVE.  BECAUSE BOTH OF THEM HAD A LOT OF MUD AGAINST THEM. THEY SAY IT'S A WASH. THEY BOTH HAVE ISSUES ALLEGEDLY WITH WOMEN, WHETHER IT'S DOMESTIC ABUSE OR ABORTION HERE OR THERE. THE VOTERS CONTINUE KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE. SO THEY'RE SAYING IT'S A WASH AND THEY'RE GOING THEIR OTHER POLICY POSITIONS.  Martha: INTERESTING. THANKS, LAWRENCE. THANKS FOR JOGGING ACROSS MANHATTAN. HE GOT A LOT OF STEPS ON THAT. THANKS VERY MUCH, A LIVE LOOK AT JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA WHERE GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS IS MAKING HIS CLOSING ARGUMENT TO VOTERS IN HIS RACE AGAINST CHARLIE CRIST AS SOME LOOK AHEAD TO 2024 AT A POTENTIAL PRIMARY MATCHUP MAYBE BETWEEN DESANTIS AND TRUMP.

        "trs": " Emily: HILLARY CLINTON DISMISSING AMERICA'S CRIME CRISIS WHILE CAMPAIGNING FOR GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL YESTERDAY IN NEW YORK CITY. WATCH THIS.  I HAVE SEEN AND I'M SURE YOU HAVE, MAYBE YOU DON'T WATCH TELEVISION. BUT IF YOU DID, YOU WOULD SEE WHAT I SEE WHICH ARE ADS ABOUT CRIME EVERY 30 SECONDS, RIGHT? NO SOLUTIONS. BUT JUST A LOT OF REALLY FEARFUL, SCARY PICTURES AND SCARY MUSIC. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT KEEPING YOU SAFE. THEY WANT TO KEEP YOU SCARED.  Emily: CLINTON'S REMARKS CAME JUST HOURS AFTER YET ANOTHER VIOLENT ATTACK IN ONE OF NEW YORK'S PRICIEST NEIGHBORHOODS. POLICING A HOMELESS MAN WITH A RAP SHEET A MILE LONG WHO WAS WANTED AND TWO SEX CRIMES RAPED AND ROBBED A WOMAN. HE'D BEEN ARRESTED 25 TIMES. THE REASON HILLARY CLINTON SAYS CRIME SHOWS SCARY IMAGES IS BECAUSE THERE ARE SCARY IMAGES. THEY HAVE BEEN FLOODING THE INTERNET. STREET CAMS IN OUR NETWORK. BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN WITH THAT LEVEL OF FLOODING.  Jimmy: THIS IS WHY HILLARY LOST 2016 AND WHY SHE'LL LOSE IF SHE RUNS AGAIN AND I BELIEVE SHE WILL RUN AGAIN. SHE HAS NO ABILITY TO CONNECT WITH WHAT COMMON PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH. HILLARY CLINTON HAS SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION EVERYWHERE SHE GOES. I'M SURE THE STREETS FEEL EXTRA SAFE TO HER. IF YOU'RE WALKING ON THE STREETS IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW, THIS LOOKS LIKE GOTHAM CITY BEFORE BATMAN. HE'S NOT COMING BECAUSE HE'S NOT VACCINATED. IT'S ABOUT TIME TO BE IN NEW YORK. TO DARESAY WE ARE TRYING TO SCARE PEOPLE. PEOPLE DON'T NEED ANY HELP GETTING SCARED. IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHY IT IS THE A, B, C ISSUE FOR A GUY LIKE ZELDA. HE'S GOING TO BE ON MY RADIO SHOW TODAY. SHAME ON HER, THAT'S DISGUSTING THAT'S THE REASON HOCHUL DESERVES TO LOSE. HER INDIFFERENCE TO THE FEAR. TO BE CLEAR. WOMEN FEEL, MOST OF THESE VICTIMS GETTING PUSHED ON THE SUBWAY, GETTING RAPE-D, ROB, STABBED. THE ETM -- REPUBLICANS HAVE OFFERED OF SOLUTIONS. THESE WOKE BILL REFORMS, STOP CUTTING THEIR BUDGETS. HILLARY CLINTON IS PART AND PARCEL TO THE CONDITIONS WERE LIVING IN BECAUSE SHE WASN'T SPEAKING UP IN THE SUMMER OF 2020 THE LEFT GOT SO CRAZY SO ANTI-COP THEY WANTED TO DEFUND THE GUY IN THE VILLAGE PEOPLE. THEY ARE DISGUSTING. SORRY. WORKED UP.  Emily: NO, WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR COMMENTS. TO JIMMY'S POINT IT ALSO IS DISINGENUOUS BECAUSE FIRST OF ALL HOCHUL, SHE'S THE SYSTEM, SHE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. WHEN HE ARTICULATED WITH THE G.O.P. HAD PUT FORTH. RESTORING JUDICIAL DISCUSSION. THE DISINGENUOUS ASPECT. HOCHUL HAS BEEN RUNNING THOSE ADS AND SHE'S BEEN RUNNING THEM BECAUSE THAT'S THE PRIMARY ISSUE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NEW YORKERS IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMY AND INFLATION. SO IT SEEMS THAT SHE'S BEEN GETTING THE MESSAGE. WHY IS HILLARY CLINTON ONLY SAYING THAT REPUBLICANS ARE DOING IT WHEN KATHY HOCHUL IS DOING IT TOO. SHE JUST DOESN'T BELIEVE IT. STEVE WORKS SHE HAS BEEN DOING IT. SHE KNOWS IT'S THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE TO VOTERS. SCARE TACTIC. OKAY, HILLARY. I'M SURE CARA BEDINGFIELD WAS SCARED WHEN SHE LOST HER LIFE. I AM SURE THIS JOGGER WAS SCARED BEFORE SHE WAS ATTACKED BY VIOLENT RAPIST. IT'S NOT A GOOD STRATEGY WHEN YOU HAVE HOCHUL SAYS MASTERMAN A GOOD LEADERS, DATER DENIERS. YOUR DISMISSING THE NUMBER ONE CONCERNS TO VOTERS. YOU CAN LIE ABOUT ABORTION ALL YOU WANT. PEOPLE AREN'T HAVING ABORTIONS EVERY DAY. WHEN YOU CANNOT LIE ABOUT OUR INFLATION AND CRIME BECAUSE PEOPLE READ THEIR LOCAL NEWSPAPERS AND THEY FEEL IT AND IT HAPPENS EVERY DAY SO BEST OF LUCK AS YOU TRY TO MISLEAD.  Emily: JULIE, YOU'VE LIVED HERE LONG TIME. WE'VE BEEN SUBJECTED TO HOCHUL'S ADMINISTRATION AFTER ANDREW CUOMO LEFT SO LET'S HAVE -- PUT IT UP FOR A SECOND, COMMENTS SHE MADE. SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN ON TOP OF CRIME. TOUGH ON CRIME.  I KNOWLEDGE THERE IS A CRIME ISSUE. IT'S NOT NEW TO ME BECAUSE IT'S ELECTION TIME. I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS THROUGH MY ENTIRE TIME AS GOVERNOR.  Emily: IS YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THE OTHER DAY, 47 OF HER 57 CAMPAIGN APPEARANCES HAVE BEEN THE LAST TWO MONTHS WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN CRIME DO BECOME A PRIORITY. WHAT ABOUT THE FIRST DAY OF ALVIN BRAGG'S TENURE WHEN SHE WROTE A LETTER THREATENING HIM WITH REMOVING HIM BECAUSE OF HIS SOFT-ON-CRIME POLICIES BUT THEN THERE WERE CRICKETS. SHE ABDICATED HER DUTY AND SHE ALSO WENT BACK ON HER WORD TO HER WORD MEANS NOTHING.  Julie: SHE HAS HAD OVER A YEAR TO MAKE SOME CORRECTIONS THAT WERE MADE BY THE FORMER GOVERNOR, ANDREW CUOMO. FOR EXAMPLE OF THIS IS SOMETHING I TALKED ABOUT SO MANY TIMES. CASHLESS BAIL. SHE'S DONE NOTHING ABOUT IT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THIS JOGGER THAT WAS ATTACKED BY SOMEBODY WHO HAD BEEN IN PRISON 20 TIMES, WHY DO YOU THINK THAT PERSON IS STILL OUT ON THE STREETS? BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE TO POST CASH TO GET OUT OF JAIL. CRIMINALS ARE GETTING OUT OF JAIL FOR FREE ESSENTIALLY. CASHLESS BAIL. BRING IT BACK. ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS. SHE JUST RECENTLY LAST WEEKS DECIDED MAYBE IT'S TIME TO PUT SOME INVESTMENT INTO THE COP SO NOW THERE'S 1200 POLICE OFFICERS OUT ON OUR STREETS WORKING OVERTIME CONSTANTLY TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE MIDTERMS AND I WILL SAY THAT I RODE THE SUBWAY FOR THE FIRST TIME, I BRAVED IT. BRYAN LLENAS DRAG ME DOWN THERE AND HE COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT I SAW. I'M NOT KIDDING. EVERYTHING A SUBWAY STOP THERE WERE POLICE. POLICE EVERYWHERE. THIS IS A POLITICAL PLOY. I WANT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS ON NOVEMBER 9. THEY WOULD SAY THAT THERE WAS NYPD ON THE PLATFORM IF YOU NEED ASSISTANCE. I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT IN MY LITERALLY IN MY 18 YEARS IN NEW YORK CITY HAVE NEVER SEEN THAT AND I GUARANTEE YOU THEY WILL NOT BE THERE NOVEMBER 9.  Emily: THERE WERE 25 PRIOR ARRESTS BUT HE WASN'T INCARCERATED FOR THE REASONS JULIE JUST ARTICULATED. HE WAS FREE ON THE STREETS. THAT'S THE POINT.  Julie: THIS WAS THE THIRD TIME HE ATTACKED A FEMALE JOGGER IN THE CITY. I AM ONE OF THOSE FEMALE JOGGERS IN THIS CITY. ALL OF US IN THE RUNNING COMMUNITY THIS MORNING ARE UP IN ARMS AT UPSET AND SCARED. IT USED TO BE SAFE TO GO OUT AND RUN AT 5:00, 6:00 IN THE MORNING. IT'S NOT. THIS HAPPENED AT HUDSON RIVER PARK. THIS AREA IS WIDE OPEN, WELL-LIT. PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE AT 5:00 A.M. WALKING THEIR DOGS. THEY ARE RIDING THEIR BIKES. PEOPLE ARE RUNNING EVERY WHICH WAY. YOU FEEL COMPLETELY SAFE, SAFER THERE THAN YOU DO IN CENTRAL PARK RUNNING. AND THIS IS WHERE SHE GOT ATTACKED AND RAPED. THEY ARE GETTING ON CITY BIKES AND THEIR COMING BY AND THEY ARE HITTING PEOPLE FROM BEHIND, ATTACKING THEM AND ROBBING THEM. THIS IS DAY-TO-DAY LIFE. KATHY HOCHUL HAS BEEN DOING NOTHING BUT GASLIGHTING US. HILLARY CLINTON DOESN'T LIVE HERE IN THE CITY, TO BE FRANK. THE REST OF US, JULIE AND I, DO. WE ARE LIVING THIS EVERY DAY. ENOUGH.  Julie: I USED TO RUN AT 11:00 AT NIGHT IN CENTRAL PARK. I WOULD NEVER DO THAT NOW. I USED TO USE MY CELL PHONE FLASHLIGHT AS MY FLASHLIGHT. NO JOKE. THAT'S HOW MUCH THE CITY HAS CHANGED. SCARY.

Brian: DAN DOESN'T NEED SECURITY AND NOW STEVE DOESN'T EITHER.  Ainsley: HE'S GOT A KNOCK DOWN BUT DEMOCRATS BRING IN HEAVY HITTERS LIKE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA TO GET CANDIDATE JOHN FETTERMAN A BOOST.  Brian: AS MOMENTUM SHIFTS TO G.O.P. CANDIDATES LIKE OZ.  SAY SOMETHING IMPORTANT.  IMPORTANT ALSO BIG NEWS OUT OF THE KEYSTONE STATE BUCKLE UP FOR A BARN BURNER FOR THE FIRST TIME DR. OZ PULLS AHEAD OF JOHN FETTERMAN CHECK THIS OUT. THE NEW EMERSON COLLEGE BOWL OZ LEADS FETTERMAN 48 TO MARK 46 BUT THE OLD TV PAL ABANDON HIM WITH A LATE ENDORSEMENT OF HIS OPPONENT, WATCH.  I SAID IT WAS UP TO THE CITIZENS OF PENNSYLVANIA AND OF COURSE I WILL TELL YOU ALL THIS, IF I LIVED IN PENNSYLVANIA I WOULD'VE ALREADY CAST MY VOTE FOR JOHN FETTERMAN FOR MANY REASONS.  PRESIDENT BIDEN AT THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL TODAY HEADING TO CALIFORNIA AND CAPPING OFF WITH FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA IN PENNSYLVANIA FOR FETTERMAN IN AN EFFORT TO SLOW THE ALL AS MOMENTUM.  LIKE WE ARE AS A PEOPLE, LIKE WE ARE AS A PEOPLE AND I WANT TO BRING BALANCE BACK INTO THIS EQUATION. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE EXTREME IDEAS OF JOHN FETTERMAN AREN'T THERE AND TO DO THAT WE N NEED O DO TWO THINGS, TWO LITTLE THINGS. IT WILL COME TO VOTE BUT IS NOT THAT SIMPLE. YOU HAVE TO GET OTHERS TO VOTE. I BELIEVE A NEW. AND I AM ASKING YOU TO COME WITH ME AND BRING TEN OF YOUR FRIENDS BECAUSE IF WE ARE ALL IN WE WIN. WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER. ALL IN, WE WIN. ALL IN, WE WIN. All in, we win. IS GOALS TITAN KATHY HOCHUL BRINGING IN THE BIG GUNS FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE PRESIDENT CLINTON AND HARRIS AS CRIME ISSUE IN THE RACE.  IT'S NOT NEW TO ME BECAUSE OF MY ELECTION TIME I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS MY ENTIRE TIME AS GOVERNOR.  LOOK AT THE COVER, AND THE HEART OF THE CITY A HOMELESS WITH 25 ARRESTS WERE A FEW OTHER SEXUAL ASSAULTS ATTACKED A FEMALE JOGGER YET ANOTHER REASON FOR RESULTING STOPPING CRIMINALS AT THE TOP OF HIS ISSUE.  IF ALL OF THE ENERGY AND THE ISSUES ON OUR SIDE AND THEY ARE DESPERATE TO TRY TO ENERGIZE THEIR BASE. THAT'S WHY THEY ARE BRINGING HILARY OUT AND COME A LA AND BILL CLINTON, JILL BIDEN, THEY ARE GETTING REALLY SMALL CROWDS. LESS THAN TWO PEOPLE AT THE EVENT WITH JILL BIDEN THERE IS NO ENERGY WE ARE OUT HERE FOCUSING ON THE ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST TO NEW YORKERS LIKE RISING CRIME.  YOU HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS ATTACK ON THE LEFT SIDE AND ZELDA AND WILL MAKE A STATEMENT ON PIER 45 WHICH IS THE SITE OF THE JOGGER ATTACK. HE WILL ALSO TALK ABOUT RAPES IN THE CITY IS UP 15% THIS YEAR.  THAT WAS AS BRIAN REQUESTED IMPORTANT GRADE WE HAD A FASCINATING CONVERSATION THIS MORNING ABOUT OPRAH WINFREY'S ENDORSEMENT OF JOHN FETTERMAN, KATIE AND I ARE SOMEWHAT UNSURPRISED THAT SHE WOULD PICK PARTISANSHIP AND A DEMOCRAT OVER A PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP. BRANDY SAID THIS MORNING A LITTLE TAKEN ABACK THAT SHE WOULD TAKE ASIDE AND SIDELINED THAT FRIENDSHIP I GET YOUR POINT. SHE DIDN'T SATISFY THE FRIENDSHIP JUST FOR A DEMOCRAT. SHE DID IT FOR JOHN FETTERMAN.  Brian: RIGHT, FLAWED CANDIDATE GOING TO THE LEFT, THIS GUY IS KNOWN FOR PREDOMINANTLY LAZINESS AND BEING THE BERNIE SANDERS OF PENNSYLVANIA WHICH IS A TOUGH SELL WHICH IS WHY CONOR LAMB WHO MANY THOUGHT WAS A MODERATE WITH MILITARY BACKGROUND WOULD EXCEL BUT HE DIDN'T, FETTERMAN WINS THE PRIMARY IS UP TO THAT PARTY TO FIGURE OUT SO FETTERMAN EMERGES HAS A STROKE, DISAPPEARS, SO WHEN HE DOES COME BACK HE IS CLEARLY FLAWED AND CLEARLY STRUGGLING. THE WORST DEBATE PERFORMANCE EVER AND THIS IS WHEN OPRAH SACRIFICES HER FRIENDSHIP TO COME OFF THE SIDELINES AND SAY I WOULD VOTE FOR FETTERMAN WITHOUT SAYING DR. OZ AND I ARE FRIENDS, I HAVE WORKED WITH HIM OVER 20 YEARS. HE HAS PROVIDED A LOT OF MONEY AND SYNDICATION AND IS EXTREMELY COMPETENT. BY THE WAY, THEY HAVE SPENT THE LAST FEW MONTHS SAYING DR. OZ IS A PHONY DOCTOR. WHAT A WEIRD THING TO SAY ABOUT A LEADING HEART SURGEON. PHONY DOCTOR?  Katie: FETTERMAN IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE MODERN DEMOCRATIC PARTY. HE IS THE LEFT, HE IS DEMOCRAT SO I AM NOT SURPRISED OPRAH WINFREY WOULD FOR HER WEIGHT BEHIND HIM.  Brian: BY KATIE OF SO MUCH VARIANCE IN POLITICS, TIM SAYS TO WIN AND OHIO PURPLE/RED STATE AFTER RUN FOR MY PARTY. IT TO HER MIKE WIN ABOUT SOMETHING I THAT YOU HAVE TO DO THE SAME THING.  Katie: WE WILL SUE THE VOTERS THEY. THAT EITHER NOT VOTING OR SWITCHING THEIR VOTE AS WE SEE IN THE STUDIO AT TOWN HALL THEY WILL TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THAT LATER BURIED ONE THING I WANT TO SAY QUICK ABOUT THE BELDEN-LOCAL RACE LEE ZELDIN HAS SAID HE HAS A ZERO TOLERANCE ON CRIME CANDIDATE WHEREAS KATHY HOCHUL HAS REPEATEDLY MADE EXCUSES FOR CRIME AND THIS WEEK IS FINALLY SAYING CRIME IS AN ISSUE AND CLAIMING SHE HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON WHEN SHE HAS NOT. I THINK PEOPLE ARE REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THAT ESPECIALLY AT THE COVER OF \"THE NEW YORK POST\" TODAY WHERE AGAIN, NEW YORKER SEVEN VICTIMIZED BY CRIMINALS REPEATEDLY LET OUT OF PRISON ON CASHEL'S BILL WHICH HOCHUL HAS NOT ONLY BEEN ENFORCING BUT HAS BEEN TALKING REPEATEDLY ON THE TRAIL.  CRIME ONE ISSUE IN NEW YORK FETTERMAN SOMEONE WAS PUSH THESE RADICAL CRIME POLICIES IN PENNSYLVANIA LIKE CASHLESS BAIL. AND THE IMPACT IS NOT JUST FOR THE AVERAGE DAY CITIZENS WERE CONGRESSIONAL SPIGOTS AS WELL, AT HARRIGAN RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN NORTH, A FORMER GREEN BERET, HAD A BULLET GO THROUGH HIS PARENTS HOME. IT IS CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED, HE WAS ON \"FOX & FRIENDS\" EARLIER.  THIS IS POLITICS AT ITS WORST AND THE REASON THIS IS THIS WAY IS BECAUSE MY OPPONENT IS DESPERATE TO DO ANYTHING HE POSSIBLY CAN'T TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT ACTUALLY MATTERS IN THIS CAMPAIGN. AND LOOK, AS A FORMER GREEN BERET, I AM USED TO GETTING SHOT AT, I'M OKAY WITH GETTING SHOT AT. I'M NOT OKAY WITH MY FAMILY GETTING SHOT AT. IT'S ANOTHER LEVEL. WHEN YOU TAKE THE TOTALITY OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED ACROSS THIS CAMPAIGN WITH THE LIES AND THE DEMONIZATION OF MY CHARACTER, NONE OF IT ADDS UP. I CAN ONLY CONTROL WHAT I CONTROL. THAT IS MY VISION IN MY AGENDA FOR THIS DISTRICT. I AM HERE TO GET THIS ECONOMY BACK ON TRACK.  HE POINTS OUT HE DOESN'T FILL MY STOMACH'S PARENTS DON'T LIVE IN A HIGH CRIME NEIGHBORHOOD, HE HAS RECEIVED INCREDIBLE DEATH THREATS AND HIS OPPONENT RUNS AD SHOWING WHERE HE LIVES AND THIS HAPPENS.  Brian: THEY WANT TO SAY HE'S BEING IRRESPONSIBLE AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SCHOOL SHOOTINGS WHICH IS INSANE AND I'M LOOKING AT THE DISTRICT I DON'T MUCH ABOUT UP THE SIDES OF THE STATS SAY AND THEY SAID TO HAVE A DEMOCRATIC DISTRICT. HOW CLOSE IS HE? THE FACT THEY ARE SO AGGRESSIVE AT HIM ONE IS SHOOTING AT HIS HOUSE MAKES ME WONDER BECAUSE YOU DON'T GET GOOD POLLING IN SMALLER DISTRICTS OBVIOUSLY IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY. WONDER HOW THAT WILL TURN OUT BECAUSE HE LOOKS UNBELIEVABLY COMPETENT.  Katie: ONE BIG TOPIC WE'VE ALL BEEN FOCUSED ON THROUGHOUT THE ELECTION IS HOW SUBURBAN WOMEN ARE GOING TO VOTE COMING UP ON TUESDAY. WE HAVE NEW POLLING SHOWING THERE IS A SHIFT HAPPENING. 27% SUBURBAN WOMEN HAVE SHIFTED AWAY FROM THE DEMOCRATS SINCE AUGUST, AND THERE IS A 15% OF THEM WHO FAVOR REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS. SO WE HAVE SEEN THAT AS A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION IN ISSUES OF INFLATION AND CRIME AFTER THE DOBBS DECISION IN JUNE DEMOCRATS REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING HAVE BE ABLE TO HAVE A MOMENT TO COME OUT AND VOTE FOR THEM BUT THAT HAS FADED AS CRIME AND INFLATION RATES SEMICOVER THEM TO THE TOP.  BIG SWING. I WANT TO ZACK ABOUT THIS WHICH WAS OFF ARAB BUT THERE WAS A TIME I WAS EMPLOYED BY CNN AND I WAS TALKING TO SONNY HOFFMAN WHO WORKS AT THE VIEW. SOMETHING HAS CHANGED AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S TELEVISION PERFORMANCE OR IF IT IS TRUMP ARRANGEMENT SYNDROME I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT THIS IS SOMETHING NEW. IT HAS BEEN HAPPENING FOR A LAB, THE. SONNY HOFFMAN SAYING THINGS LIKE THIS ON THE VIEW.  I READ A POLL YESTERDAY THAT REPUBLICAN SUBURBAN WOMEN ARE NOW GOING TO VOTE REPUBLICAN.  WHY?  IT'S ALMOST LIKE ROACHES VOTING FOR RAID, RIGHT?  NO, NO --  THEY ARE VOTING AGAINST THEIR OWN SELFISHNESS. [TALKING OVER EACH OTHER]  I KNEW WHO SONNY WAS YEARS AGO BUT MAYBE I'M WRONG. WE CAN ALL GET THAT AND SAY IT'S ATROCIOUS. THAT IS ATROCIOUS, SUNNY. THIS SHIFT YOU'VE SEEN OVER TIME IS SYMBOLIC OF A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MOVED FROM RATIONAL AND NICE TO THIS INSANITY?  Katie: I'M SURE COMPARING WHITE SUBURBAN WOMEN TO ROACHES WANTING TO BE KILLED IS THE GREATEST WAY FOR DEMOCRATS TO GET THOSE VOTERS BACK INTO THEIR CAMP, RIGHT? IF THEY'RE REALLY LOOKING TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO VOTE FOR THEM, THIS KIND OF RHETORIC AND DEHUMANIZATION OF PEOPLE WHO DISAGREE WITH WHILE CLAIMING YOU ARE THE SIDE OF TOLERANCE DOESN'T REALLY FLY.  Brian: I THINK WHAT SHE IS GETTING IS ABORTION, THEY PUT ABORTION AS A STATE DECISION AND WHY WOULD YOU VOTE FOR THAT AND THE ANSWER IS YOU WAVE OVER EMPHASIZE WOMEN'S OPINION WHEN IT COMES TO THIS AND YOU MADE THE CENTERPIECE OF ALL DEMOCRATIC ISSUES AND YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY IT IS NOT RESONATING. THAT IS WHY LOOK AT THE BOWL AND THOUGHT YOU WOULD LASH OUT. THE OTHER THING TO EVEN MIND THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT NOVEMBER 9TH, HISPANIC VOTE. LOOK AT THE WHITE SUBURBAN WOMEN IN THE HISPANIC VOTE, THAT WILL BE THE BIG CHANGE IN 2024. THAT'S HOW REPUBLICANS GO.  Katie: WOMEN ARE NOT SINGLE-ISSUE VOTERS ELECTION AFTER ELECTION.  LET'S GO TO CARLY WITH ADDITIONAL HEADLINES.  WE WILL START WITH A SCABBY POTATOES PARENTS ARE FILING A $50 MILLION LAWSUIT THEY ARGUE MOAB POLICE COULD HAVE PREVENTED GABBY'S DEATH BUT FAILED TO PROPERLY INTERVENE LAST SUMMER AFTER THE COUPLE GOT INTO A FIGHT, THE WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT FURTHER ALLEGES THE OFFICERS WERE NOT PROPERLY TRAINED, BRIAN LAUNDRY KILLED GABBY PETITO TWO WEEKS LATER. PAUL RETURNS HOME FROM HOSPITAL, NANCY'S HUSBAND WEEKS AFTER GETTING HIT BY A HAMMER IN THE VIOLENT ATTACK HOMELAND SECURITY SAYING DAVID DEPAP IS AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT FROM CANADA, FACING A SERIES OF CHARGES INCLUDING ATTEMPTED MURDER. WE ARE OF COURSE FOUR DAYS AWAY FROM THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND CANDIDATES ARE NOW PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS. TEXAS CANDIDATE BETO O'ROURKE IS NOW DANCING FOR VOTES WHILE PUSHING A PRO-ABORTION MESSAGE. \u266a \u266a THE DEMOCRATS INTERESTING ATTEMPT AT GAINING ATTENTION COMES AS INCUMBENT G.O.P. GREG ABBOTT LEADS BY NEARLY TEN POINTS THERE. THE HOUSTON ASTROS ARE ONE WIN AWAY FROM THEIR SECOND WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONSHIP.  CENTER GUARD TRYING TO FINISH WITH AN EXCLAMATION. INSTEAD A FLY BALL TO LEFT AS A RACK, UNDER THE TRACK AT THE WALL, PAIN HAS DONE IT AGAIN!  MONSTER HOME RUN BY ROOKIE JEREMY PENA PUT THEM TO A VICTORY, JUST IN BERLIN ARE ALSO SHINING EARNING HIS FIRST WORLD SERIES WIN. THE SERIOUS SHIFTS BACK TO HOUSTON IN GAME 6 AS WIN OR GO HOME FOR THE PHILLIES COVERAGE BEGINS AT 6:30 P.M. EASTERN, 3:30 P.M. PACIFIC ONLY A FOX BACK TO YOU.  Brian: RATINGS HAVE GONE BACK UP FOR BASEBALL SO EXCITING, THEY USE THE HIGHEST SINCE 2015.  Katie: AND THE WEATHER IS GOOD FOR BASEBALL'S ALSO.  I COULD SHARE THIS BECAUSE I GOT A TWEET FROM SOMEONE OUT THERE THIS IS A GREAT QUESTION WE WILL LEAVE IT HANGING AT OPEN. SOMEONE NEEDS TO ASK OPRAH WINFREY. WOULD YOU HIRE JOHN FETTERMAN TO RUN YOUR COMPANY?  Brian: BECAUSE YOU HIRED DR. OZ TO RENEW SHALL.  Katie: HASHTAG DRAMA FIRED TWITTER EMPLOYEES SUING AS MUSK CLEANS HOUSE.  PLUS WILL CHECK IN WITH TOWN HALL TO SEE WHAT ISSUES ARE DRIVING THEM TO THE POLLS ON TUESDAY AND I SAY THE BEST TOWN HALL EVER, BEST GROUP OF PEOPLE EVER. LOOK ABOUT WARDROBE. BE WHEN ARE GREAT.

SHE'S MONITORING WHAT'S GOING ON IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHICH WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A RAZOR TIGHT RACE AND IS.  Sandra: PRESIDENT BIDEN WON BY SEVEN POINTS. LOOK WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS RACE. MAGGIE HASSAN IS PULLING 48% TO BOLDUC. IT'S A THREE-POINT MARGIN. THIS RACE IS GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER. A LOT OF THIS RACE IS STARTING TO BE MORE AND MORE ABOUT HEATING YOUR HOME THIS WINTER, THE HIGHS PRICE OF FOOD AS BOLDUC SAYS IT'S ABOUT HEATING AND EATING IN THIS STATE. WE'RE WATCHING THE LATEST POLLING OUT OF EMERSON COLLEGE SHOWING THIS RACE IS NECK AND NECK. THE TOP ISSUES AS WE'RE SEEING IN SO MANY RACES, WHETHER IT'S GUBERNATORIAL, SENATORIAL OR THE HOUSE RACES, IT'S ABOUT THE ECONOMY. 36% SAY FOR THEM IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, FOR VOTERS, IT'S THE TOP ISSUE. ABORTION ACCESS, POLLING VERY HIGH AT 24%. THREATS TO DEMOCRACY, 17%. HEALTHCARE ALSO A CONCERN FOR VOTERS. WHEN YOU DO -- LET'S SEE. OKAY. WHEN YOU DO LOOK AT THE PRICE OF HEATING IN THAT STATE, NEIL, WE'RE HEARING ON THE GROUND THERE, THIS IS WHAT VOTERS ARE TALKING ABOUT. THREE DAYS FROM A BIG ELECTION. THEY'RE LOOKING AT THEIR BILLS ALREADY AND FEELING THESE HIGH PRICES. THIS COULD INFLUENCE A LOT OF THOSE UNDECIDED VOTERS THAT HAVE NOT CAST THEIR BALLOTS YET. NATURAL GAS, 28%. HEATING OIL PRICES UP 27%. ELECTRICITY. THAT JUMP IS NOT AS BIG. ELECTRICITY PRICES WERE ALREADY UP A LOT HEADING IN TO THE OCTOBER MONTHS. SO THIS IS A YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGE. THIS IS A REALITY THAT SO MANY ARE DEALING WITH. PROPANE, UP 5% AS WELL. THESE ARE BIG PROBLEMS FOR VOTERS. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE INFLUENCE IS ON SOME OF THESE RACES. NATURAL GAS PRICES IN GENERAL, THEY ARE JUST BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. NEIL, WHEN YOU PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE, YOU'RE LOOKING AT GAS PRICES FOR THOSE THAT LIVE IN THAT STATE WELL ABOVE WHERE THEY WERE WHEN PRESIDENT BIDEN TOOK OFFICE. OVER A DOLLAR HIGHER IN FACT. THE HIGH GAS PRICES FACTORING IN TO INFLATION BEING A TOP CONCERN FOR VOTERS. THAT'S WHAT IS MAKING THIS RACE SO CLOSE. I WILL FINISH OFF BY GOING WHERE I LEFT OFF. THAT IS TALKING ABOUT THE BLUE NATURE OF THIS STATE AND THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, IF I CLICK ON THIS. IT WILL SHOW YOU THE OUTCOME, 2020, PRESIDENT BIDEN 52.9% TO PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 45.5%. WHICH MAKES THIS RACE SO INTERESTING. RIGHT? THAT YOU COULD HAVE A REPUBLICAN VICTORY IN THAT SENATORIAL RACE THERE BEATING THE INCUMBENT. SENATOR MAGGIE HASSAN. NOT THERE YET. IT'S NECK AND NECK AND A RACE WE'LL WATCH CLOSELY ON ELECTION NIGHT.  Neil: TO YOUR POINT, THE FACT THAT IT'S NECK AND NECK AND SO MANY RACES ARE IN TRADITIONALLY BLUE STATES IS REMARKABLE.  Sandra: THANKS.  Neil: SANDRA HAS BEEN EVERYWHERE. NOW SHE'S GOING ACROSS THE STREET ON OTHER SHOES. IT'S NONE STOP. WE'RE FOCUSING ON NORTH KOREA. WHILE WE'RE FIXATED ON, THIS COUNTRIES ARE WONDERING COULD YOU COOL IT WITH THE MISSILE STRIKES? OVER THE LAST TWO DAYS, 30 OF THEM THAT PROMPTED EVACUATION WARNINGS IN JAPAN AND THE SAME IN SOUTH KOREA WHERE FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER ONE LANDED JUST OFF THE SOUTH KOREAN COAST.

        "trs": "WELCOME TO A SPECIAL EDITION OF -- LOOKING BACK IN 25 NEWS MAKERS AND POLITICS, BUSINESS, POP ULTRA, ENTERTAINMENT, AND SPORTS. AND WHETHER THEY WERE UP OR DOWN BY THE END OF THE YEAR. AND, DONNY GEORGE IS HERE TO TAKE US THROUGH THEM ALL. YIKES. A LOT OF BRANDS DOWNS. SOME GROUND. UPS  AND YOU KNOW, THE THING, IS SOME OF THESE ACTUALLY ARE A BIT OBVIOUS. BUT WHAT MAKES IT SO INTERESTING IS, WE'VE GOT JOHNNY. HERE HE'S GOT THAT SPECIAL SAUCE. HE OBVIOUSLY. AN ADVERTISING LEGEND. A BRANDING LEGEND. HE'S GOT THE BRANDING. A NO YOU'VE EVER BEEN OVER TO HIS PLACE. HE HAS THE SUPERCOMPUTER. THE BRANDING SUPERCOMPUTER. WE GO TO THIS GUY TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS UP, WHO IS, DOWN AND WHY.  THERE'S ABOUT 2017 YEARS SCIENTISTS WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK. OUT OF THE WAY THEY ARE, DANISH BUT THAT'S JUST. SOMEHOW THEY KIND OF GOT TOGETHER. AND THEY WORK WITH THE SUPERCOMPUTER. THEY USE A GOOGLE MACHINE, ALSO. THEY DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. GEORGE, SAID A LOT OF THESE. A LOT OF TIMES WE DO THIS ON A WEEKLY BASIS. I KIND OF DO FUNNY THINGS LIKE BILL BEAT MARTINIS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I TRIED TO JUST, WHEN WE LOOK AT A YEAR IN 25 OF THEM. WE CAN UPENDED TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF BASICALLY THE TWO-DAY STEWARDS OF MOURNING  A YEAR AND RAP WOULD BE NEGLIGENT NOT TO. DO IT  AND YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE HE'S GOT THE DOUBLE BREASTED BLAZER ON SO IT'S GAME. ON  IT IS GAME DAY. AND I WILL TELL, YOU IF THE CHOICE OF THE DOUBLE BREASTED BLAZER, THE DANISH SCIENTISTS IN THEIR LAP JACKETS, IN THEIR LAB COATS WERE THE ONES THAT TOLD HIM TO WEAR THAT. THAT IS ALL WE ARE GOING TO SAY ABOUT THE DANISH SCIENTISTS. WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE. I WANT TO START WITH DONALD TRUMP. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THAT IS OBVIOUS BUT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND I WILL TELL YOU. WHY THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH A REMARKABLE SIX YEARS. AN EXTRAORDINARY SIX. YEARS AND, IT SEEMS THE TRUMP ERA IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE. DONALD TRUMP, OBVIOUSLY DONNY, LET'S START WITH THE OBVIOUS, RAN DOWN, RIGHT?  I CAN THINK IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS CULTURE OF ONE BRAND THAT HAS GONE FROM 60 TO 0 FASTER AND IN A MORE STUNNING FASHION. WE CAN PROBABLY, BRAND UP BRANDAUN TRIBUTES. I COULD GIVE 25 GRAND ATTRIBUTES. EVERYTHING FROM STEALING THE DOCUMENTS, TO ENDORSING JUST ABOUT EVERY LESION CANDIDATE, TO HIS POLLING NUMBERS, TO THE JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE POSSIBLY GONNA BRING UP ON CRIMINAL CHARGES, TO HIS BUSINESS BEING FOUND ON 17 COUNTS ON EVERY SINGLE JUDGMENT MADE AGAINST HIM. FROM HAVING DINNER WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND ANTISEMITES, HIM SAYING WE SHOULD THROUGHOUT THE CONSTITUTION. I MEAN, IT IS AND. LIST IS COMPLETELY ENDLESS. THERE IS NO BRANDS THAT IS MORE DOWN IN OUR CULTURE RIGHT NOW. AND THE LATEST POLL NUMBERS THAT WE ARE SEEING WITH HIM 20 POINTS BEHIND DESANTIS KIND TO SAY TO PEOPLE THEY FINALLY FIGURED IT. OUT  SO THE FORMER PRESIDENTS BRANDAUN, THE CURRENT PRESIDENT, BRAND.  YEAH, OVER THE YEARS I'VE BEEN A LITTLE CRITICAL OF HIM SAYING THAT HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE HIS MOJO. BUT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PIER BLOCK ATTACKING. THE LEGISLATIVE VICTORIES WHETHER IT IS THE CHIPS, MANUFACTURING, WHETHER IT IS GUN CONTROL, CLIMATE, BUILD BACK BETTER, THE INFLATION ACT, I MEAN NO PRESIDENT HAS GOT MORE DONE IN HIS FIRST TERM PROBABLY SINCE FDR. AND YOU ALSO SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS IN TERMS OF HIS COATTAILS OR THE NEGATIVE COATTAILS OF DONALD TRUMP AS FAR AS THE WAY THE DEMOCRATS HAVE PERFORMED. SO, UNDER THE GUISE OF A BRAND OF QUIET COMPETENCY WE, OBSCENITY, OF STABILITY. YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM A MAJOR BRAND. I DON'T CARE WE ARE COMING FROM. WE  AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS SO FASCINATING IS, AND WE SEE THIS ONCE IN A WHILE WE. JOE BIDEN'S SUPERPOWER POLITICALLY HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED. I REMEMBER WRITING A COLUMN IN THE WASHINGTON POST, EVERYBODY THOUGHT HE WAS FINISHED AFTER IOWA NEW HAMPSHIRE. I SAID, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I AM PROUD OF JOE BIDEN. AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED. HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED ON TWITTER. GOING INTO THE 2020 CAMPAIGN. THERE WERE PEOPLE ALL AROUND BARACK OBAMA THAT DIDN'T WANT HIM TO RUN. THEY WOULD TALK TO ANY REPORTER OFF THE RECORD THEY COULD, TALKING ABOUT HOW HE WASN'T UP TO THE JOB. OF COURSE, YOU HEARD A LOT OF THE SAME TOP FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS. AGAIN, SAYING THAT THIS GUY WAS TAKING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DOWN, AND HE NEEDED TO QUIT. ONCE AGAIN BRAND UP. HE ALWAYS, HE ALWAYS BEATS EXPECTATIONS.  DEMOCRATS NEVER AND DIDN'T IN THE MIDTERMS KNOW WHAT THEY HAD IN JOE BIDEN. THEY HAD SOMEONE WHO WAS A SKILLED POLITICIAN, WHO'S MADE HIS MISTAKES ALONG THE WAY, ALONG DECADES WHO HAS LEARNED FROM THEM WHO KNEW EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE CARED ABOUT. DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE POLLS. HE STAYED FOCUSED ON TWO ISSUES RIGHT BEFORE THE MIDTERMS AND IT WAS ABORTION AND DEMOCRACY. AND, LIKE A LASER, HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ANYBODY. AND, BY THE WAY, PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO CAMPAIGN NEXT. TIM I, MEAN COME ON DEMOCRATS. USE YOUR. AS WE  AND REALLY, ISN'T IT FUNNY, HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED AND YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS THAT WOULD NOT SAY WHETHER THEY THOUGHT HE SHOULD RUN AGAIN IN COMPETITIVE DEMOCRATIC RACES. WHICH IS CRAZY.  THEY ARE STILL SAYING. YET THEY'RE STILL NOT SURE IF THEY WANTED TO RUN AGAIN DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE BEAT DONALD TRUMP ONCE AND HAD THIS RUN IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. ALL RIGHT, DONIE, LET'S KEEP MOVING. BRETT UP TO FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS.  YOU YEAH. AT THE LATEST POLLS. I'M GONNA HEDGE THIS BECAUSE HE RAMMED UP WITH THE SUCCESS HE'S HAD. I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE HIS BRAND VERY MUCH. I THINK HE'S GOT A LOT OF DANGEROUS ATTRIBUTES TO HIM. BUT, LOOK. THIS IS THE GUY THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO THE DANCE WITH TRUMP AND NOT NECESSARILY IN THE WAY WE ENDORSE. NOT NECESSARILY COMING AFTER HIM AT SOME POINT IN TIME THE RUBBER IS GONNA HIT THE ROAD. IN THE LATEST, POLLS WE SEE HIM 20 POINTS AHEAD OF TRUMP WHICH IS AMAZING. HE WON OVERWHELMINGLY IN FLORIDA. HE SEEMS TO BE THAT FAIR HAIRED BOY. HE HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG. HE MIGHT THAT SHRINK IN THE ARMOR IS I THINK THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE HE SAYS, WE NEED TO WIN GUYS. IT IS ABOUT WINNING. AND I'M GOING TO STAND FOR A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS THAT YOU ARE GUYS STANDS FOR, BUT WE ARE GONNA DO IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. WE ARE GONNA TAKE A LOT OF THE VITRIOL OUT. HE IS CLEARLY RIGHT NOW THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY. BUT, LET'S PUT ABOUT ON THIS. YES AND TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE SHOW A LOT. WE KIND OF HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ON THE BIG STAGE. WE HAVEN'T SEEN CANDY TAKE A PUNCH. WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM UNDER THE TYPE OF SCRUTINY ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. SO, RIGHT NOW, ON HIS YEAR YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM A MAJOR BRAND. UP BUT, THIS IS STILL A TBD  AS DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES TO FADE THERE WILL BE INCREASING CALLS FOR HIM TO JUMP INTO THIS RACE. WE'LL SEE IF HE DOES. IT LET'S KEEP MOVING ON OUR BRANDS. LIZ CHENEY THIS YEAR FOR HER WORK ON THE JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE.  YEAH. SHE IS TRULY I THINK THAT THE AMERICAN HERE OF THE YEAR AS FAR AS AMERICANS GO. SHE COST HER JOB. IT'S ONE THING TO KIND OF GO OUT ON THE LINE, AND ONE THING TO STAND UP AND TAKE A STAND. IT IS ANOTHER THING WHEN YOU ARE SACRIFICING. AND THIS IS A WILL PROBABLY SEE THE REPUBLICANS. NOT ONE OF THEM. BECAUSE THEY REALIZE IF THEY DO STAND UP, A LOT OF THEM LOSE THEIR JOB. AND SHE LOST HER JOB. SHE WILL BE A POLITICIAN ON THE SCENE FOR DECADES TO COME. SHE COULD BE PRESIDENTIAL TIMBER IN THE FUTURE. BUT, I THINK THAT HER BRAND IS AS STRONG AS ANY POLITICAL BRAND OUT THERE. AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE HER KUDOS. EVERY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. SHE PUT ON A STUNNING PERFORMANCE IN GENERAL SIX. WE  OFTEN HEAR HOW DIVIDED THE LECTURE IT IS. MAYBE. THEY ARE I BROUGHT UP ANTHONY FAUCI A FEW WEEKS BACK TALKING ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS KEEP BASHING FAUCI. HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON OUT OF 15 PEOPLE PULLED IN A RECENT POLL THAT WAS POSITIVE. NUMBER TWO, THE ONE CLOSEST TO ANTHONY FAUCI, LIZ CHENEY. WE  SHE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF THE PAST YEAR ESPECIALLY, FOR THE COUNTRY. ON THAT FRONT. SOMEONE WHO YOU COULD SAY MAYBE WAS DOING THE OPPOSITE, MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. YOU SAY BRANDON, AND I WONDER THOUGH IF YOUR FEELINGS DON'T MATCH REALITY HERE. BECAUSE, SHE'S ACTUALLY GAINING IN POWER. WE  SHE IS GAINING POWER. BUT I THINK THAT SHE IS GONNA RUN INTO A BUZZSAW. SHE'S COME OUT WITH EVERYTHING FROM, HEY IF I WAS IN CHARGE WE WOULD'VE WON THAT JANUARY SIX. I WOULD'VE HAD GUNS THERE, THINGS LIKE THAT. I JUST THINK THAT WE ARE HEADING INTO A MOMENT OF TIME WITH THAT TYPE OF VITRIOL, THAT TYPE OF HATE, YES YOU GET THE MEDIA TENSION. BUT I THINK AS THE REPUBLICANS, JOE YOU TALK SOMEONE JUMPS ON THE SHOW ABOUT THE LOSING STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLICANS. SHE MAY, HER BRAND SO TO SPEAK AS FAR AS AWARENESS AND POPULARITY IN A VERY NARROW SEGMENT MIGHT BE UP, BUT HER BRAND OF THE NATIONAL STAGE, BEING ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY LONG TERM, I THINK IS-LIMITED. I THINK THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME.  BIG SWAY FOR THE MOMENT THOUGH. WITH INFLUENZA OR KEVIN MCCARTHY.  OH MY GOSH, THAT'S. TO KEVIN, NEVER KEVIN. YOU NEVER. NOW AND, FINALLY JOHNNY. NANCY PELOSI. WE BRAND UP.  YEAH, YOU GUYS SHOWED A COUPLE OF WEEKS JOHN BOEHNER GETTING UP THERE AND CRYING AS HE TALKED ABOUT IT. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE HAD AS AN EFFECTIVE SPEAKER IN MY LIFETIME. SAYING WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT HER, LIKE HER NOT LIKE HER, THE LEVEL OF COMPETENCY, THE WAY SHE KEPT A CAUCUS IN LINE, THE WAY SHE IS HANDLED HERSELF WITH DIGNITY AND EVERY SINGLE MOMENT, SHE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE GREAT SPEAKERS OF ALL-TIME. YOU'VE GOT TO TIP YOUR HAT TO NANCY PELOSI.  WITHOUT QUESTION. WE LET'S MOVE ON TO VOTERS. YOU'RE STARTING A BRAND UP WITH INDEPENDENT VOTERS. WHY DO YOU SAY? THAT  WELL AN INTERESTING PANEL RECENTLY CAME OUT TO ASK PEOPLE TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. MORE PEOPLE IDENTIFY THEM AS INDEPENDENTS AND THEY DO ENOUGH REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS. AND THEN GET INDEPENDENTS HAVE REALLY COME TO BEAR IN THE LAST ELECTION. THE INDEPENDENTS I BELIEVE MORE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP SAVED OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO CAME UP AND SPOKE. AND I THINK INDEPENDENT AS A BRAND IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW. WE ARE NOT, YES WE ARE TWO PARTY SYSTEM, BUT MOST PEOPLE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WARDROBE OF ATTRIBUTES, THEY DON'T LINEUP COMPLETELY WITH A PARTY. I THINK INDEPENDENT IS GOING TO BE A BIGGER BRAND AS WE MOVE FORWARD.  REPUBLICANS BLEW, WHICH WOULD BE A LAB OF MIDTERM ELECTION SEASON, GIVE A BRAND DOWN.  YEAH. JOE, YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT ENOUGH. IT IS JUST, WHAT A LOSING STRATEGY. THE PARTY OF NOTHING. EVEN AFTER ALL OF THESE LOSSES, WHAT DO THEY COME FORWARD WITH? HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE LOST, THEY CAN'T GET, UP AND THE PROBLEM THAT THEY HAVE GOING FORWARD, DONALD TRUMP ALTHOUGH HE SEEMED DISINTEGRATED AS FAR AS HIS BRAND IN POPULARITY, I DON'T SEEM DISAPPEARING. I SEE HIM GOING BACK TO OUR LAST SEGMENT, RUNNING AS AN INDEPENDENT. A VERY DEMOCRATIC INDEPENDENT. AND HE STILL HOLDS THAT. BASE SO, THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. THEY HAVE A MAJOR BRANDING PROBLEM. I THINK IF YOU PULLED 90% OF REPUBLICANS THEY WOULD SAY, WE WANT HIM TO GO AWAY.  THEY ARE STUCK WITH. HIM AND THEY ARE STUCK WITH HIS GRIEVANCE. AND THEY HAVE A PROBLEM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. UNLESS RON DESANTIS CAN REALLY RESCUE THIS PARTY, THIS PARTY IS IN DEEP TROUBLE.  AND THE PROBLEM IS, AGAIN PUTTING IT IN DONNY'S TERM, THEY'RE MICRO-TARGETING. THEY KEEP MICRO-TARGETING TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE BUBBLE. THEY KEEP TRYING TO CONVERT THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY CONVERTED. THEY ARE TALKING TO THEMSELVES. AND SO, WHEN YOU ARE LOSING THE SUBURBS, WHEN YOU'RE LOSING MIDDLE AMERICA, WHEN YOU ARE LOSING SWING VOTERS, WHEN YOU ARE JUST NOT GOING TO WIN ELECTIONS SAYING, YEAH THEY REMAIN FOCUSED ON MICRO-TARGETING. AND I THINK THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS ACTUALLY WAS IN ARIZONA. THE FINAL WEEK OF THE MIDTERM CAMPAIGN. OUT OF ARIZONA, KARI LAKE DECIDED TO ATTACK MCCAIN VOTERS AND SAID, IF YOU ARE A VACATE VOTER. GET OUT OF HERE. I HAVE TO SAY, AS A FORMER POLITICIAN, YOU JUST SHUT. ARE YOU WANT EVERY VOTE. YOU WANT, EVERYBODY ON YOUR SIDE. AND YET, WE KEEP PUSHING PEOPLE AWAY.  YES, THEY DO. AND YOU KNOW ANOTHER ISSUE WHERE THEY DO THAT IS ABORTION, DONIE. IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT POLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, ON DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS, REPUBLICANS EVEN ARE SPLIT ON ABORTION. AND MORE OF THEM ARE FOR WOMEN HAVING THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT. ROE V. WADE, BRAND.  YEAH, I THINK THIS WAS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IN THE LAST ELECTION IN THE POLLS WERE SHOWING. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GET ISSUES. I THINK THIS IS THE TONE DEAFNESS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A SUPREME COURT DECISION, NOT NECESSARILY THE PARTY'S DECISION, BUT. I THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CAUSE OF WE -- FOR DEMOCRATS. I THINK IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT GOING BACKWARDS VERSUS GOING FORWARD. THAT IS A BRAND THAT, AS LONG AS REPUBLICANS ARE STUCK WITH THE ANTI ROE V. WADE, THE ROLLBACK ROE V. WADE, THEIR BRAND STAYS TARNISH. SO YOU KIND OF HAVE TO INTERLOCKED TO THEM.  I'VE GOT TO SAY, THERE ARE, WELL SOME OF THESE THINGS SEEM OBVIOUS TO US NOW AS WE TALK ABOUT ROE V. WADE, IT IS SHOCKING THAT AMERICANS WOULD RESPOND AS OVERWHELMINGLY AS THEY DID. IF YOU LOOK AT POLLS, IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS, IF YOU LOOKED SWING VOTERS WERE, IT IS VERY SURPRISING LOOKING BACK TO SEE JUST HOW DRAMATIC THE BACKLASH. WAS OUR LAST FRIEND, BRANDEN OF THE SEGMENT. IS GLOBAL. AND IF YOU GO BACK A YEAR, IT IS VERY SAFE TO SAY LITERALLY NOBODY WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING. EVEN UKRAINIANS. VLADIMIR PUTIN, BRAND WAY DOWN. SO LEWINSKY, BRAND WAY UP. NOBODY COULD'VE IMAGINED WHEN THOSE TANKS STARTED ROLLING IN AND PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT UKRAINIANS WOULD COLLAPSE IN THREE, FOUR, FIVE DAYS. NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE WOULD BE TALKING AND THIS IS WHERE THE ARROWS WOULD BE POINTING. IN A REALLY DRAMATIC HISTORIC WAY, DONNY.  YEAH, NOT ONLY JUST PUTIN. IT REALLY SHOWS IT UNDER EARTH AND TOOK THE EMBERS CLOSE OFF RUSSIA AS FAR AS NOT BEING THE SUPERPOWER. CERTAINLY IT IS A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY IN SO MANY WAYS. AS YOU, SAID IF THEY WERE CHOOSING UP SIDES IN THE BEGINNING IT'S INHIBITING, ON UKRAINE TO RUSSIA, IT WOULD BE A NO-BRAINER. ZELENSKYY HAS BEEN SO PITCH PERFECT IN THE WAY HE'S HANDLED THE MEDIA. THIS ALSO GOES BACK TO JOE BIDEN AND NATO. ADAM BRING ABOUT THIS OUT OF TIME WITH HIS BRAND. THE NATO COALITION THAT HE PUT TOGETHER. BUT, ZELENSKYY WAS TIME AGA ZIENTS MADE OF THE YEAR RIGHTFULLY SO. PUTIN IS A DAMAGED HURT BRAND. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS EXIT RAMP IS, BUT ZELENSKYY IS AN INTERNATIONAL HERO, AND I THINK TIME AUGUSTINE HAS IT COMPLETELY RIGHT.  WELL, STILL AHEAD ON THE SPECIAL EDITION OF BRAND OF BRANDAUN, DONNEK GIVES US THE TRENDS FOR SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN BUSINESS, SPORTS, AND ENTERTAINMENT. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. ENTERTAINMENT. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. 20221231203737.355|20221231204027.392",

        "trs": " WITH THE NEW YEAR JUST HOURS AWAY, LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE A LOOK BACK AT THE YEAR THAT WAS. HERE'S NBC'S JOE FIRE TO BREAK DOWN THIS WHILE THE YEAR.  THE HEADLINES THAT DEFINED 2022 WERE SEISMIC AND HISTORIC. EUROPE'S LARGEST ARMED CONFLICT SINCE WORLD WAR II. A SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT OVERTURNED MORE THAN FOUR DECADES OF PRECEDENT. THE DEATH OF A MONARCH WHO HAD REIGNED FOR 70 YEARS. YET, IN ITS EARLIEST DAYS, 2022 SEEMED MORE LIKE A COPYCAT, MAKING THE WORST QUALITIES OF THE TWO PREVIOUS YEAR'S.  NEW STAGGERING COVID NUMBERS, DAILY CASES SURPASSING 1 MILLION.  AS THE NEW YEAR BEGAN, OUR FIGHT WITH COVID STUBBORNLY RAGED ON.  A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY SICK.  THE RAPIDLY SPREADING OMICRON VARIANT KILLING 60,000 AMERICANS IN JANUARY. WITH TIME, THE PANDEMIC DID LOOSEN ITS GRIP.  THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION NO LONGER ENFORCES THE FEDERAL MANDATE REQUIRING MASKS ON U.S. AIRPORTS AND ON BOARD AIRCRAFTS.  AS MASK MANDATES --  WE ARE SO HAPPY.  NEW THREATS EMERGED.  GROWING CONCERN ABOUT ANOTHER VIRUS CALLED MONKEYPOX.  MONKEYPOX, FLU, THE RESPIRATORY VIRUS RSV.  IT'S A SERIOUS ILLNESS. YOU KNOW, WITH HIM BEING THIS YOUNG.  OVERSEAS, IT WAS A DIFFERENT BATTLE THAT RATTLED THE WORLD. IN FEBRUARY, RUSSIA STORMED INTO UKRAINE WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS, ONLY TO BE MET BY A RESILIENT FOR. IT'S INSPIRING LEADER, PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY, REFUSED TO FLEE. THOSE STRIKES PUSHED UKRAINIANS TO BOMB SHELTERS INTO THE COUNTRY'S SWOLLEN BORDERS.  YOU CAN HEAR THE FAMILIES, THEY'VE COME WITH ALL THEIR BELONGINGS. PEOPLE ARE HUGGING AND SAYING GOODBYE AND NOT SURE IF THEY WILL EVER COME BACK.  MILLIONS OF UKRAINIANS SUDDENLY BECAME REFUGEES. BUT AS THE YEAR PROGRESSED, UKRAINE'S MILITARY TOOK BACK LAND THAT HAD BEEN LOST JUST MONTHS EARLIER. STEADY PROGRESS IN A LONG WAR, NOW ENTERING THE DARK DAYS OF WINTER. IN AMERICA, WINTER STORMS IN EARLY.  WE'VE SEEN OVER 50 INCHES OF SNOW AND UNDER 24 HOURS.  RECORD BREAKING SNOW STORMS DUMPED NEARLY SEVEN FEET OF SNOW ON TO BUFFALO REGION. IN FLORIDA, HURRICANE IAN PUMMELED THE COAST WITH WINDS THAT REACHED 155 MILES AN HOUR.  IT CAN'T WITHSTAND THIS KIND OF STUFF.  JUST SHY OF A CATEGORY FIVE.  THESE CARS WERE NICELY PARKED. THEY ARE FLOATING FREELY NOW.  FLORIDA'S DEADLIEST HURRICANE SINCE 1935. GUN VIOLENCE CONTINUE TO DEVASTATE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NATION WITH HUNDREDS OF MASS SHOOTINGS.  WE ALL RAN TO THE BACK. HE WAS SHOOTING AT THE --  TEN WERE KILLED IN A SUPERMARKET IN BUFFALO, SEVEN IN A FOURTH OF JULY PARADE IN HIGHLAND PARK, ILLINOIS. FIVE WERE MURDERED IN AN LGBTQ NIGHTCLUB IN COLORADO SPRINGS, AND AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN UVALDE, TEXAS.  CAN YOU TELL THE POLICE TO COME TO MY ROOM?  I REVEAL READY TOLD THEM TO GET TO THE ROOM --  19 YOUNG CHILDREN, TWO TEACHERS LOST THEIR LIVES TO A TEENAGE GUNMAN WHO RAVAGED THEIR CAMPUS.  HOW DID HE GET IN THERE?  ADDING TO THEIR GRIEF, QUESTIONS OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT'S DELAYED RESPONSE.  HANDS OFF!  EMOTIONS WERE HIGH ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHEN, IN JUNE, THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNED ROE V. WADE.  I FEEL LIKE I GOT PUNCHED IN THE STOMACH THIS MORNING.  FOR SOME, THERE WAS ANGER AND FEAR.  WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE TREATED AS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS.  FOR OTHERS, IT WAS A CELEBRATORY MOMENT DECADES IN THE MAKING.  AMAZING VICTORY.  BACK TO LIFE HAS BEEN VINDICATED. THE VOICELESS ARE FINALLY GIVEN A VOICE.  ABORTION WAS ONE OF MANY ISSUES DOMINATING POLITICS IN 2022. SO WAS INFLATION, WHICH REACHED 40 YEAR HIGHS.  IN EVERY ASPECT, IT'S TIRED. YOUR WAGES DON'T GO UP ANY HIGHER.  IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER MONTHS, THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR GAS SORT.  PRESIDENT BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATING DROPPED, DESPITE THAT DEMOCRATS WERE ABLE TO FEND OFF A RED WAVE DURING THE MIDTERMS. NBC NEWS IS NOW PROJECTING THAT DEMOCRATS WILL MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE SENATE.  HOLDING THE SENATE AND NARROWLY LOSING THE HOUSE. THE ELECTIONS WAKE, SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI ANNOUNCED SHE WAS STEPPING DOWN FROM LEADERSHIP. JUST WEEKS AFTER HER HUSBAND WAS ATTACKED IN THEIR HOME.  FOR ME, THE HOURS COME FOR A NEW GENERATION TO LEAD THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS THAT I SO DEEPLY RESPECT.  THE DUST FROM THE MIDTERMS WAS STILL LINGERING IN THE AIR. THE 2024 CAMPAIGN BEGAN.  IN ORDER TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AND GLORIOUS AGAIN, I AM TONIGHT ANNOUNCING MY CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP DECLARED HIS CANDIDACY, RUNNING AGAIN AMID A LAUNDRY LIST OF INVESTIGATIONS. THAT INCLUDES A RATE OF HIS MAR-A-LAGO ESTATE, THE FBI SEIZED THOUSANDS OF DOCUMENTS, SOME MARKED CLASSIFIED. BACK IN WASHINGTON, THE HOUSE COMMITTEE INVESTIGATING THE JANUARY 6TH INSURRECTION HELD TELEVISED HEARINGS, ONE OF THE STAR WITNESSES, A 25-YEAR-OLD FORMER TRUMP WHITE HOUSE AIDE NAMED CASSIDY HUTCHINSON.  HE DIDN'T LOOK AT FROM HIS PHONE AND SAID SOMETHING TO BE EFFECTIVE, THERE'S A LOT GOING ON, CASS. I DON'T KNOW, THINGS MIGHT GET REAL, REAL BAD ON JANUARY 6TH.  IN LONDON, QUEEN ELIZABETH CELEBRATED HER PLATINUM JUBILEE, MARKING 70 YEARS ON THE THRONE. HER JUNE APPEARANCES AT THE BUCKINGHAM PALACE BALCONY FLANKED BY FAMILY, INCLUDING HER SEEN STEALING GREAT GRANDSON, PRINCE LOUIS, HER FINAL TIMES ON THAT STORIED PERCH.  SOME SAD, BREAKING NEWS. QUEEN ELIZABETH II, BRITAIN'S LONGEST REIGNING MONARCH, HAS DIED.  IN SEPTEMBER, THE QUEEN DIED AT THE AGE OF 96. HER SON, CHARLES, IMMEDIATELY ASCENDED TO THE THRONE.  AS I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY, I CANNOT HELP BUT FEEL THE WEIGHT OF HISTORY.  FOR THE UK, IT WAS A YEAR OF TRANSITION WITH ONE PRIME MINISTER RESIGNING.  I WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW SAD I AM TO BE GIVING UP THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD.  THEN JUST WEEKS LATER, ANOTHER.  I AM RESIGNING AS LEADER OF THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY.  THREE LEADERS IN A SINGLE YEAR.  I WILL UNITE OUR COUNTRY.  CHANGE WAS ON THE MINDS OF PROTESTERS IN IRAN. THEY TOOK TO THE STREETS ANGERED BY THE DEATH OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO DIED AFTER SHE WAS ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY VIOLATING THE COUNTRY'S STRICT DRESS CODE. WHILE IN RUSSIA, AMERICAN BASKETBALL STAR BRITTNEY GRINER SPENT MOST OF 2022 BEHIND BARS. CONVICTED ON DRUG CHARGES.  VERY -- EXPERIENCED.  SHE WAS RELEASED IN DECEMBER IN A PRISONER SWAP. SHE WAS RELEASED IN DECEMBE IN A PRISONER SWAP THE WORLD GATHERED IN BEIJING FOR THE WINTER OLYMPICS, WHERE SNOWBOARDING PHENOM CHLOE KIM CAPTURED GOLD AGAIN.  ALL RIGHT, OPENING CEREMONY. AS THE FLYING TOMATO CAME IN FOR A FINAL LANDING, SHAUN WHITE ROUTE FIRED AFTER BARELY MISSING THE PODIUM.  THIS IS I THINK MY LAST ROUND.  THIS IS IT?  I THINK SO, YEAH.  ANOTHER G.O.A.T., SERENA WILLIAMS, SEEMED TO STEP AWAY FROM TENNIS AFTER AN EMOTIONAL RUN AT THE U.S. OPEN. BUT LATER, SHE PROCLAIMED, I AM NOT RETIRING.  SERENA WILLIAMS, WHO ARE YOUR BEST FRIENDS?  HER CHILDHOOD STORY WAS FEATURED IN THE MOVIE KING RICHARD STARRING WILL SMITH, WHOSE OSCAR WIN WAS OVERSHADOWED BY THIS.  THE SLAP HEARD AROUND THE WORD OLD. SMITH LATER APOLOGIZED FOR THE MOORE -- STOLE THE SPOTLIGHT FROM OTHER WINNERS, INCLUDING BEST PICTURE -- AND INDEED DRAMA ABOUT A DEAF FAMILY.  WHAT THE HELL?  BIG SCREEN BLOCKBUSTERS CAME ROARING OUT OF THE DANGER ZONE WITH TOM CRUISE'S TOP GUN MAVERICK TOPPING A BILLION BUCKS AT THE WORLDWIDE BOX OFFICE.  I WANT TO MANAGE EXPECTATIONS.  TWITTER GOT A CONTROVERSIAL NEW OWNER, ELON MUSK, WHILE A SUPREME COURT GOT A HISTORY MAKING NEW JUSTICE, KETANJI BROWN JACKSON. SHE REPLACED THE RETIREE STEPHEN BREYER, BECOMING THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO SIT ON THE HIGH COURT.  IN MY FAMILY, IT TOOK JUST ONE GENERATION TO GO FROM SEGREGATION TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.  LIFT OFF OF ARTEMIS ONE.  AND NASA'S ARTEMIS 1 FINALLY WENT FROM EARTH TO SPACE. AFTER THE LAUNCH WAS CALLED OFF A FEW TIMES, THE ROCKET TOOK OFF IN NOVEMBER, UNMANNED MISSION PAVING THE WAY FOR ASTRONAUTS TO SOMEDAY RETURN TO THE MOON. THE DAWN OF A NEW ERA -- TO A NEW YEAR.

        "trs": " YOU KNOW, TUESDAY WAS A GOOD DAY FOR AMERICA. A GOOD DAY FOR DEMOCRACY. IT WAS A STRONG NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS.  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOWED THAT EVEN IN A MIDTERM ELECTION. WHEN THE PENDULUM TENDS TO SWING TO THE OUT PARTY. EVEN UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS, THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO STANFORD DEMOCRACY FOR FREEDOM.  IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DIE HARD TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE QUITTING TRUMP.  THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAVE SEEN TRUMP TRAILING OTHER REPUBLICAN SINCE THE EARLY DAYS OF HIS PRIMARIES IN 2016.  DONALD TRUMP'S LEGAL PROBLEMS ARE STACKING UP YET AGAIN. A NEW YORK JURY FOUND HIS COMPANY GUILTY OF TAX FRAUD.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE EVIDENCE DESCRIBED BY MY COLLEAGUES TODAY, AND A THREAT STUMBLED THROUGHOUT OUR HEARINGS. WARRANTS A CRIMINAL REFERRAL OF FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP.  I THINK THAT THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS CATCHING UP WITH HIM. AND I THINK HE HAS RUN OUT OF HIS STREAM OF CORRUPT IN TERMS OF WHAT HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO AVOID.  2022 WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR FOR DEMOCRACY, AND A VERY BAD YEAR FOR THE TWICE IMPEACHED NOW CRIMINALLY REFERRED DISGRACED EX PRESIDENT. OUR FRIEND TYLEE SYKES FOR THE QUOTE, IT WAS A BAD YEAR FROM AUTHORITARIANS. FROM PUTIN, TO WALL SCENARIO. WHO IS DEFEATED IN THE ELECTION. IT WAS A GOOD YEARS,, WEAKENING FOR DEMOCRACY. AND THEN THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING FORMER GUY SULKING OVER HIS FORM FLORIDA LAYER. BRACING HIMSELF FOR WHAT IS GOING TO BE A GENERALLY, LEAP NEW YEAR FOR HIM. LET'S BRING IN STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL AND MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR RICK, AND FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY AND NOW LAW PROFESSOR AT THE AT ALABAMA. AND ALSO MSNBC ANALYST. AND I'LL SHARPTON IS HERE, MSNBC'S POLITICSNATION HOST. NOW, THIS IS THE INFLECTION POINT. THIS IS JOYCE FOR ALIGNING ME ON TWITTER. THIS IS THE LAST SHOW OF 2022.  I THINK THAT WE HAVE HAD A VERY GOOD HERE IN TERMS OF DEMOCRACY. YOU SEE REAL SIGNIFICANT PUSHBACK ABOUT VOTERS AND THE FACT THAT THE RED WING AND IT UP LESS THAN A RED PUDDLE. THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SEEN DONALD TRUMP MELTDOWN LIKE A SNOWMAN IN JULY. AND HE IS GOING INTO NEW YEAR'S EVE WITH HIS WHOLE REPUTATION TATTED, BECAUSE EVEN THOSE WHO SAID THAT WE NEEDED SOMEONE LIKE DONALD TRUMP, WHO WAS A VERY SHREWD AND HUNTING BUSINESSMAN, NOW SEES THAT HE IS A LOSER OF THE HIGHEST ORDER. ACCORDING TO HIS OWN TAXES, AND I THINK THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT EVEN THE GEORGIA RUNOFF, WHEN THEY THREW IN SO MUCH MONEY AND LOST THE SENATE, AND IN FACT THE DEMOCRATS GAINED A SEAT. I THINK THAT IT WAS A GOOD YEAR FOR DEMOCRACY, IT WAS NOT A GREAT YEAR. BUT WE FACED THE HEAD WENT. WE DID NOT HAVE THE WIND DIALED BACK, WE WERE INCREASING THE HEADWIND AND WE WERE ABLE TO SURVIVE IT.  JOYCE, YOUR HIGHS AND LOWS FOR THE 2022?  SO I HOPE WE WILL LOOK BACK ON 2022 AS THE YEAR THAT THE FEVER DREAM BROKE. THEY ARE THAT THE AND EVIDENT WILL DECLINE OF DONALD TRUMP BEGAN, BUT I'M CLEAR ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE IS STILL A FREE MAN, WALKING AROUND AT MAR-A-LAGO. AND EATING AT THE DESSERT BAR AND WE DON'T STILL KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS UP TO HOLDING HIM ACCOUNTABLE. I HAVE TO SAY, I AM INCREASINGLY ENCOURAGED ON ALL FRONTS. I THOUGHT SOME OF THE BIGGEST NEWS THIS YEAR INVOLVES BREAKING THE MAR-A-LAGO DOCUMENT STORY. IT WAS OUT OF THE BLUE, COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED, AND AT THE SAME TIME A VERY, I SHOULDN'T SAY VERY SIMPLE, BUT A MUCH SIMPLER MORE LINEAR CRIMINAL SITUATION. WHERE I THINK WE WILL SEE RELATIVELY QUICK ACTION FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, WHICH IS OF COURSE AS EVERYONE KNOWS, A LUMBERING GIANTS, BUT FOR VERY GOOD REASONS WHEN IT COMES TO DOING ITS CASES. BUT IN A WAY THAT IS VERY FRUSTRATING TO THE PUBLIC. WE ALSO SAW THAT THIS IMMACULATE WORK BY THE JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE, AND I THINK REALLY WITHOUT THEIR EFFORT, WE WOULD NOT BE VIEWING DONALD TRUMP THE WAY THE COUNTRY CLEARLY IS. AND MUCH OF THAT WORK, ALONG WITH ONE OF THE LOWER POINTS OF THE, YEAR THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION, THE DOBBS, THE ABORTION CASE. I THINK IT PROPELLED VOTERS IN THE POLLS, DURING THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. WITH RESULTS THAT WERE GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY. IT IS EASY TO BE DISAPPOINTED, BECAUSE DEMOCRATS DO NOT CONTROL BOTH HOUSES. AND SO MUCH OF THE MUCH NEEDED REFORM, VOTING REFORM, IMMIGRATION REFORM, MAY NOT HAPPEN. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT DEMOCRACY IS ALWAYS ASPIRATIONAL. WE NEVER PLAYED GET THERE, WE'RE ALWAYS WORKING TOWARDS BEING MORE FAIR, MORE INCLUSIVE, MORE JUST. AND HOLDING THE BAD GUYS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ESTEEMS. I THINK 2022 WAS A YEAR WHEN WE STARTED MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  RICK, I DO NOT ENVY YOU TO GO AFTER JOYCE. THIS IDEA OF THE IMMACULATE WORK PRODUCT, AND THE EMASCULATE COHESION. I DON'T KNOW THE LAST TIME THAT WE SAW CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE WORK LIKE THAT. SOME OF IT WAS BECAUSE WHILE THEY WERE NOT UNITED IN THEIR PARTY AFFILIATION, THERE WERE TWO REPUBLICANS GIVEN VERY PROMINENT ROLES IN THE COMMITTEE. THEY WERE UNITED IN MISSION. AND IT WAS MIRACULOUS, TO BE REMINDED OF WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE. TAKE US THROUGH YOUR HIGHS AND LOWS.  WELL, ON THAT POINTS, THE LAST TIME WAS PROBABLY THE WATERGATE HEARINGS. AND LIKE THE WATERGATE HEARINGS, THE JANUARY SIX COMMISSION AND SERVED AN EDUCATIONAL FUNCTION. JUST SEEING SMART PEOPLE, WHO ARE SYLLABLE, WHO ARE USING THE LAW, WHO ARE DEFERRING TO EACH OTHER. IT MAKES PEOPLE HAVE SOME RESPECT FOR CONGRESS AGAIN, I THINK THAT WAS SUPER IMPORTANT, IN ADDITION TO THE HISTORIC REFERRAL AND INDICTMENT OF DONALD TRUMP, BUT YOU ALSO SAW ON WASHINGTON POST, AS ONE OF MY HIGHLIGHTS. A RETURN TO BIPARTISANSHIP, THE CHIP SPILL, THE GUN SAFETY BILL, THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. THOSE WERE ALL BIPARTISAN BILLS. THOSE WERE ALL BILLS THAT MET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SO I AM SOMEWHAT HOPEFUL THAT IN THE NEW YEAR, EVEN WHEN THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE, THAT WE CAN RESTORE SOME OF THAT BIPARTISAN INITIATIVE. BECAUSE THOSE BILLS, AND THOSE INFRASTRUCTURES ARE NOT IDEOLOGICAL. EVERYONE CAN GET BEHIND, THAT AND I AGREE WITH BOTH THE REV AND JOYCE THAT THERE IS KIND OF A RETURN TO COMMON SENSE, A RETURN TO NORMALCY, I HOPE THAT WILL PERVADE THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS AS WELL.  I WRITES, NO ONE'S GOING ANYWHERE, AND YOUR EARS ARE NOT BETRAYING YOU. YOU'RE HEARING SOME OPTIMISM. BUT WE WILL FIT IN A QUICK BREAK. WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE ON THE OTHER SIDE!

        "trs": "> I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT THE NATION IS PERMANENTLY DIVIDED. IT IS NOT. PRINCIPLES MUST NEVER BEEN COMPROMISED, BUT COMPROMISE IS NOT A DIRTY WORD. IT'S HOW OUR GOVERNMENT WAS DESIGNED TO WORK. I HAVE DONE IT MY WHOLE LIFE. IT'S WHAT I'LL DO AS PRESIDENT.  THAT WAS A REFRAIN OF THEN CANDIDATE JOE BIDEN AND HE TOOK A LOT OF HEAT FOR REMARKS LIKE THAT ON THE 2020 CAMPAIGN TRAIL. THE FORMER SNAR, A MAN WHO BEEN IN POLITICS FOR 30 YEARS NEVER WAVERED THAT HE WOULD WORK WITH REPUBLICANS TO PASS MAJOR BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION. CREDIT WHERE DUE, HE WAS RIGHT. AS THE 117th CONGRESS COMES TO A CLOSE, I'M STRUCK BY HOW MUCH BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATS WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THE NARROW HOUSE MAJORITY AND AN IMPROBABLE 50/50 TIE IN THE SENATE. NOW, TO BE CLEAR, THE PARTY CERTAINLY DIDN'T GET EVERYTHING IT WANTED. THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF MAJOR ISSUES DEMOCRATS WANTS AND NEED TO ADDRESS, FOR INSTANCE, RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, EXPANDING VOTING RIGHTS, ENSHRINING ABORTION RIGHTS. BUT THIS WAS A BUSY TWO YEARS. THERE ARE TWO BUCKETS OF VICTORIES. SOME OF THE BIGGEST ONES CAME SOLELY FROM DEMOCRATS WHO USED A BUDGETING LOOPHOLE, RECONCILIATION, TO BYPASS THE FILIBUSTER AND PUSH THROUGH TRANSFORMATIVE LEGISLATION ON A PARTY LINE VOTE. FOR INSTANCE, THE FIRST THING THEY DID, THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN. NEARLY $2 TRILLION COVID STIMULUS PLAN THAT I THINK REALLY PAVED THE WAY FOR THE VERY STRONG ECONOMY WE HAVE SEEN FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE. THEN THIS YEAR, THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT, THE COMPREHENSIVE BILL PASSED WHICH DOES A LOT INCLUDING INVESTING IN GREEN ENERGY, AND LOWERING THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AMONG OTHER THINGS. THAT'S THE STUFF THEY WERE ABLE TO DO ON A PARTY LINE VOTE WITH 50 VOTES IN THE SENATE. BUT AS BIDEN PROMISED ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, THERE WERE QUITE A FEW BIPARTISAN COMPROMISES AS WELL. MANY MORE THAN I WOULD HAVE GUESSED. THERE WAS, FOR INSTANCE, THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, THE FIRST GUN SAFETY REFORM LEGISLATION IN LITERALLY DECADES. THERE WAS THE CHIPS ACT, WHICH INVESTS IN DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING OF COMPUTER PARTS. THERE WAS THE EMMETT TILL ANTILYNCHING ACT, WHICH FINALLY CLASSIFIED LYNCHING AS A FEDERAL CRIME. AND THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT, WHICH CODIFIED AND PRESERVED AMERICA'S SAME-SEX MARRIAGES. THERE WAS EVEN BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT ON A NEW PROVISION IN THE GOVERNMENT FUNDING BILL WHICH REFORMS THE ELECTORAL COUNT ACT IN ORDER TO HELP PREVENT ANOTHER ATTEMPTED COUP LIKE THE ONE DONALD TRUMP TRIED TWO YEARS AGO. NOW, THIS ERA, THESE TWO YEARS OF ACCOMPLISHMENT WILL LIKELY COME TO AN END WHEN REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE IN A FEW DAYS. BUT IT'S WORTH TAKING NOTE OF WHAT THIS PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE IN TWO SHORT YEARS AND WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT THE NATURE OF AMERICAN POLITICS AT THIS MOMENT. I'M JOINED BY DONNA EDWARDS WHO REPRESENTED MARYLAND'S FOUR CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. BRIAN FALLON IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF DEMAND JUSTICE. HE PREVIOUSLY HAS SERVED AS CHIEF SPOKESPERSON FOR CHUCK SCHUMER, AND SYMONE SANDERS, SHE PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS SENIOR ADVISER AND CHIEF SPOKESPERSON FOR VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS. SHE WORKED ON PRESIDENT BIDEN'S 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AND BERNIE SANDERS' 2016 CAMPAIGN. SYMONE -- EXCUSE ME, SORRY. LET ME START WITH YOU AND ASK YOU FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHY YOU THINK THIS CONGRESS AND THIS PRESIDENT IN THESE SORT OF TWO TRACKS, THE RECONCILIATION DEMOCRAT ONLY, THE BIPARTISAN BILLS, WAS ABLE TO BE AS PRODUCTIVE LEGISLATIVELY AS IT WAS?  I THINK ON THE RECONCILIATION PIECE, YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THE COUNTRY WAS FACING A NUMBER OF CONVERGING CRISES WHEN THE BIDEN/HARRIS ADMINISTRATION FIRST TOOK OFFICE. THEY WERE ALSO, WE WERE REELING FROM THE DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENCY, WHICH I THINK GIVEN EVERYTHING THAT WE NOW KNOW, HAS BROUGHT US TO THE VERY EDGE AND CLIFF OF THE DEMOCRACY THAT WE NOW KNOW, SO THERE WAS A SENSE OF URGENCY FROM NOT JUST THE WHITE HOUSE BUT FOLKS ON CAPITOL HILL TO GET SOMETHING DONE. SO THERE WASN'T A LOT OF ARM TWISTING IF YOU WILL FOR THE AMERICAN -- THE ARP. THE FIRST BILL THAT WAS PASSED. AND FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE, IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GET THE ARP BECAUSE IF YOU COULD NOT DO THAT, THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN, YOU WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ELSE. I THINK ON THE OTHER BILLS, THE BIPARTISAN BILLS THEY WERE ABLE TO GET DONE, THEY WERE ALL ON THINGS OF CONSEQUENCE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT GUNS, THERE'S A GUN EPIDEMING IN THIS COUNTRY, BOTH THE EVERYDAY GUN VIOLENCE WE DON'T HEAR TOO MUCH ABOUT BUT THEN THE MASS SHOOTINGS. UVALDE, BUFFALO, SACRAMENTO, SHOOTINGS IN SCHOOLS IN VIRGINIA. WE COULD GO ON. I THINK THESE WERE THINGS THAT WERE CONFRONTING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AT THE TIME. THE CHIPS ACT, OKAY. EVERYONE KNOWS WHO HAS BEEN OUT THERE TO BUY A CAR, CARS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE. EVEN IF YOU'RE BUYING USED CARS. THE CHIPS ACT IS ACTUALLY VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. ONE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UNITED STATES CAN COMPETE, BUT TWO, TO REALLY AFFECT THE EVERYDAY LIVES OF AMERICAN PEOPLE OUT THERE.  DONNA, YOU WORKED IN THE HOUSE, AND WE HAVE GONE THROUGH DIFFERENT ERAS IN TERMS OF WE HAVE SEEN INCREASING POLARIZATION. WE HAVE ALSO SEEN INCREASING DYSFUNCTION IN CONGRESS, AND A REAL CHANGE IN CONGRESS FROM THE SORT OF OLD COMMITTEE SYSTEM THAT REALLY WOULD SORT OF HAVE LEGISLATION COME THROUGH THE COMMITTEE AND THEN GET TURNED INTO LEGISLATION TO A MORE SORT OF PARTY LED APPARATUS. IT DOES STRIKE ME THAT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A RETURN OF THE OLDER SYSTEM IN WHAT PEOPLE CALL SECRET CONGRESS, WHICH IS WHEN CONGRESS IS DOING STUFF THAT IS NOT AT THE CENTER OF THE CULTURE WAR OR POLITICAL POLARIZATION LIKE THE CHIPS ACT, FOR INSTANCE, THERE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF THAT KIND OF OLD SCHOOL HORSE TRADING STAFF MEMBERS, COMMITTEE MEMBERS IRONING OUT LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE THAT DOES SEEM LIKE WHETHER FOR GOOD OR ILL, IS A FUNCTIONAL SYSTEM OF CRAFTING LEGISLATION.  I THINK THAT'S TRUE, AND I MEAN, EVEN IF YOU GO BACK TO THE TIME THAT I SERVED, THERE WERE TIMES WHEN, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHERE THAT WAS ACTUALLY HANDLED IN THREE COMMITTEES AND THEN BROUGHT TOGETHER BY THE LEADERSHIP. OR THE INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE THAT WAS JUST PASSED. THAT WAS HANDLED IN THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND THEN BROUGHT TO THE LEADERSHIP. I THINK THERE ARE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES WHERE CONGRESS, WHAT YOU DESCRIBED AS THE SECRET CONGRESS REALLY DOES FUNCTION. IT'S JUST THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T GET TO SEE THAT VERY MUCH.  WHAT DO YOU THINK, BRIAN? WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF WHY THIS CONGRESS AND THIS PRESIDENT WERE ABLE TO PASS AS MUCH AS THEY WERE?  ONE FACTOR I THINK, CHRIS, WE SHOULDN'T OVERLOOK IS I THINK THESE PAST TWO YEARS IS REALLY THE CONGRESS WHERE CHUCK SCHUMER SORT OF STEPPED OUT AND ESTABLISHED HIMSELF AS EVERY BIT THE PARLIAMENTARIAN LEGISLATIVE MAGICIAN THAT PEOPLE HAVE LONG CREDITED MITCH McCONNELL WITH BEING, AND PEOPLE HAVE RIGHTLY CREDITED HARRY REID WITH BEING. CHUCK SCHUMER FOR HIS PART WAS SOMEBODY DURING THE SIX YEARS I WORKED FOR HIM WAS KNOWN FOR HIS ABILITY TO GARNER HEADLINES, FOR HIS ABILITY TO FUND-RAISE, ALWAYS KNOWN AS A CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST BUT LESS KNOWN AS SOMEONE WHO CAN WHIP VOTES AND DELIVER ON A LEGISLATIVE AGENDA. WE TALKED ABOUT THE CHIPS ACT AS ONE OF THE PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT DID PASS ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. REMEMBER, THERE WAS GAMESMANSHIP PLAYED AROUND THAT BILL. MITCH McCONNELL WAS THREATENING TO SINK THAT BILL AND ONLY LET REPUBLICANS GO FORWARD WITH VOTING FOR IT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THAT JOE MANCHIN WAS NOT GOING TO VOTE WITH THE DEMOCRATS ON THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT. IT WAS SCHUMER WHO HAD A SECRET DEAL WITH MANCHIN THAT HE DIDN'T DIVULGE UNTIL AFTER THE REPUBLICANS GAVE HIM THE VOTES TO PASS THE CHIPS BILL. I THINK JOE BIDEN DESERVES A GREAT DEAL OF CREDIT, NANCY PELOSI DESERVES A GREAT DEAL, BUT CHUCK SCHUMER ALSO A BIG PIECE OF THE SUCCESS STORY.  THAT'S A GREAT POINT. PERSONNEL MATTERS. JUST TO REMEMBER THAT, IT WAS BASICALLY THE CHIPS WAS BEING NEGOTIATED. THEY WERE ALSO TRYING TO GET MANCHIN TO YES ON INFLATION REDUCTION ACT. McCONNELL SAYS IF MANCHIN DOES THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT, CHIPS IS DEAD. HEADLINES COME OUT SAYING MANCHIN HAS WALKED AWAY FROM THE TABLE. NO INFLATION REDUCTION ACT. CHIPS GETS PASSED. THE DAY IT GETS PASSED, ACTUALLY, THERE'S A DEAL. McCONNELL WAS PRETTY TICKED OFF. I THINK, SYMONE, THAT JOE BIDEN HAVING BEEN A SENATOR FOR 40 YEARS PROBABLY PLAYS A LITTLE BIT OF A ROLE TOO.  I THINK HE DOES PLAY A ROLE, BUT I THINK FROM MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE PRESIDENT, HE REALLY DOES LEAN ON AND RESPECT THE KNOWLEDGE OF BOTH THE SPEAKER PELOSI AND THE LEADER IN THE SENATE. BUT LOOK, CHUCK SCHUMER IS THE ONE WHO HAS THE LEAD THE SENATE CAUCUS. IT IS NOT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND UNDERSTANDING THAT, HE DOESN'T STEP ON SCHUMER'S TOES, BUT JOE BIDEN IS SOMEBODY WHO DOES NOT BELIEVE IN LEGISLATING BY EXECUTIVE ORDER. I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CRITICISM THIS YEAR OF WHY HE COULDN'T DO X, Y, AND Z VIA EXECUTIVE ORDER. I THINK BECAUSE HE COMES FROM THE UNITED STATES SENATE, THAT HISTORY MEANS THAT HE PUTS A LITTLE MORE WEIGHT ON WHAT THE FOLKS IN CONGRESS CAN GET DONE.  THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER TWO OTHER ASPECTS I THINK HERE THAT I THINK EXPLAIN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. I WANT TO GET INTO BOTH OF THEM. THE THREE OF YOU WILL STICK AROUND. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK AFTER THIS BREAK. 20221231004726.125|20221231004834.193",

        "trs": ". > YOU KNOW, TUESDAY WAS A GOOD DAY FOR AMERICA, A GOOD DAY FOR DEMOCRACY, AND IT WAS A STRONG NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS.  THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOWED THAT EVEN IN A MIDTERM ELECTION, WHEN THE PENDULUM TENDS TO SWING TO THE OUT PARTY, EVEN UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS, THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO STAND FOR DEMOCRACY, FOR FREEDOM.  THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO WERE DIE HARD TRUMP SUPPORTERS ARE QUITTING TRUMP.  THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN TRUMP TRAILING OTHER REPUBLICANS SINCE THE EARLY DAYS OF HIS PRIMARIES IN 2016.  DONALD TRUMP'S LEGAL PROBLEMS ARE STACKING UP YET AGAIN. A NEW YORK JURY FOUND HIS COMPANY GUILTY OF TAX FRAUD.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE EVIDENCE DESCRIBED BY MY COLLEAGUES TODAY AND ASSEMBLED THROUGHOUT OUR HEARINGS WARRANTS A CRIMINAL REFERRAL OF FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.  I THINK THE LEGAL SYSTEM IS CATCHING UP WITH HIM, AND I THINK HE HAS SORT OF RUN OUT OF HIS STRING OF GOOD LUCK IN TERMS OF WHAT HE'S BEEN ABLE TO AVOID.  2022 WAS A VERY GOOD YEAR FOR DEMOCRACY AND A VERY BAD YEAR FOR THE TWICE-IMPEACHED, NOW CRIMINALLY-REFERRED, DISGRACED EX-PRESIDENT. IT WAS A BAD YEAR FOR AUTHORITARIANS, FROM PUTIN TO BRAZIL'S BOLSONARO, WHO WAS DEFEATED FOR RE-ELECTION. IT WAS A GOOD YEAR, RELATIVELY SPEAKING, FOR DEMOCRACY. THERE IS THE BIGGEST LOSER OF THE YEAR, THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING FORMER GUY SULKING IN HIS FLORIDA LAIR. LET'S BRING IN TOP STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL, RICK STENGEL. PLUS JOYCE VANCE IS HERE, LAW PROFESSOR AT UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA, ALSO MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST. AND REVEREND AL SHARPTON IS HERE, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK. REV, WHERE DO YOU PUT THE YEAR, THIS INFLECTION POINT. JOYCE REMINDED ME ON TWITTER, THIS IS OUR LAST SHOW OF 2022.  WELL, I THINK THAT WE'VE HAD A VERY GOOD YEAR IN TERMS OF DEMOCRACY. YOU'VE SEEN REAL SIGNIFICANT PUSHBACK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE RED WAVE ENDED UP LESS THAN A RED HUDDLE, THE FACT THAT WE'VE SEEN DONALD TRUMP MELT DOWN LIKE A SNOWMAN IN JULY. AND HE'S GOING INTO NEW YEAR'S EVE WITH HIS WHOLE REPUTATION TATTERED. BECAUSE EVEN THOSE THAT HAD SAID THAT WE NEEDED SOMEONE LIKE DONALD TRUMP, WHO WAS A VERY SHREWD AND CUNNING BUSINESSMAN, NOW SEES THAT HE IS A LOSER OF THE HIGHEST ORDER, ACCORDING TO HIS OWN TAXES. AND I THINK WHEN WE LOOK EVEN TO THE GEORGIA RUNOFF, WHERE THEY THREW IN SO MUCH MONEY AND LOST THE SENATE AND IN FACT THE DEMOCRATS GAINED A SEAT. SO, I THINK IT WAS A GOOD YEAR FOR DEMOCRACY. IT WAS NOT A GREAT YEAR. BUT WE FACED THE HEAD WIND. WE DIDN'T HAVE THE WIND TO OUR BACK. WE WERE FACING THE HEADWIND, AND WE WERE ABLE TO SURVIVE IT.  JOYCE, YOUR HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 2022?  SO, I HOPE WE'LL LOOK BACK ON 2022 AS THE YEAR THAT THE FEVER DREAM BROKE, THE YEAR THAT THE INEVITABLE DECLINE OF DONALD TRUMP BEGAN. BUT I'M CLEAR ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE IS STILL A FREE MAN WALKING AROUND AT MAR-A-LAGO AND EATING AT THE DESSERT BAR. AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IS UP TO HOLDING HIM ACCOUNTABLE. I THOUGHT SOME OF THE BIGGEST NEWS THIS YEAR INVOLVED BREAKING THE MAR-A-LAGO DOCUMENT STORY. THAT WAS OUT OF THE BLUE, COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED. AND AT THE SAME TIME, A VERY -- I SHOULDN'T SAY VERY SIMPLE, BUT A MUCH SIMPLER, MORE LINEAR, SORT OF A CRIMINAL SITUATION WHERE I THINK WE'LL SEE RELATIVELY QUICK ACTION FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, WHICH IS, OF COURSE, AS EVERYONE KNOWS, SORT AFTER I LUMBERING GIANT, FOR VERY GOOD REASONS WHEN IT COMES TO DOING ITS CASES, BUT IN A WAY THAT'S VERY FRUSTRATING TO THE PUBLIC. WE ALSO SAW THAT THIS IMMACULATE WORK BY THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE. I THINK REALLY WITHOUT THEIR EFFORT, WE WOULD NOT BE VIEWING DONALD TRUMP THE WAY THE COUNTRY IS. AND MUCH OF THAT WORK, ALONG WITH THE LOW POINTS OF THE YEAR, THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION, AND DOBBS, THE ABORTION CASE, I THINK PROPELLED VOTERS TO THE POLLS FOR THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, WITH RESULTS THAT WERE GOOD FOR DEMOCRACY. IT'S EASY TO BE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE DEMOCRATS DON'T CONTROL BOTH HOUSES AND SOME OF THE MUCH-NEEDED REFORM, VOTING REFORM, IMMIGRATION REFORM, MAY NOT HAPPEN. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT DEMOCRACY IS ALWAYS ASPIRATIONAL. WE NEVER QUITE GET THERE. WE'RE ALWAYS WORKING TOWARDS BEING MORE FAIR, MORE INCLUSIVE, MORE JUST, AND HOLDING THE BAD GUYS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR MISDEEDS. I FEEL LIKE 2022 WAS A YEAR WHERE WE STARTED MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.  RICK, I DON'T ENVY YOU. I THINK SHE MADE ME CRY TWICE. THIS IDEA OF THE IMMACULATE WORK PRODUCT AND THE IMMACULATE COHESION -- I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW THE LAST TIME WE SAW A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE WORK LIKE THAT. SOME OF IT WAS BECAUSE, WHILE THEY WERE NOT UNITED IN THEIR PARTY AFFILIATION, THERE WERE TWO REPUBLICANS WHO WERE GIVEN VERY PROMINENT ROLES IN THE COMMITTEE, THEY WERE UNITED IN MISSION. AND IT WAS MIRACULOUS TO BE REMINDED OF WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE. JUST TAKE US THROUGH YOUR HIGHS AND LOWS.  JUST ON THAT POINT, THE LAST TIME WAS PROBABLY THE WATERGATE HEARINGS. AND LIKE THE WATERGATE HEARINGS, THE JANUARY 6th COMMISSION SERVED AN EDUCATIONAL FUNCTION. JUST SEEING SMART PEOPLE WHO ARE CIVIL, WHO ARE USING THE LAW, WHO ARE DEFERRING TO EACH OTHER, IT MAKES PEOPLE HAVE SOME RESPECT FOR CONGRESS AGAIN. I THINK THAT WAS SUPER IMPORTANT, IN ADDITION TO THE HISTORIC REFERRAL AND INDICTMENT OF DONALD TRUMP. BUT YOU ALSO SAW IN WASHINGTON, THIS IS ONE OF MY HIGHLIGHTS, A RETURN TO BIPARTISANSHIP. I MEAN, THE CHIPS BILL, THE GUN SAFETY BILL, THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, THOSE WERE ALL BIPARTISAN BILLS. THOSE WERE ALL BILLS THAT BENEFIT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SO, I'M SOMEWHAT HOPEFUL THAT IN THE NEW YEAR, EVEN WITH A REPUBLICAN HOUSE, THAT WE CAN RESTORE SOME OF THAT BIPARTISAN INITIATIVE BECAUSE THOSE BILLS AND THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT IDEOLOGICAL. EVERYBODY CAN GET BEHIND THAT. AND I AGREE WITH BOTH THE REV AND JOYCE THAT THERE'S BEEN A RETURN TO COMMON SENSE, A RETURN TO NORMALCY. I HOPE THAT WILL PREVAD THE LEGISLATIVE AGENDA OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS AS WELL.  ALL RIGHT. NO ONE IS GOING ANYWHERE. AND YOUR EARS ARE NOT BETRAYING YOU. YOU'RE HEARING SOME OPTIMISM. BUT WE HAVE TO FIT IN A QUICK BREAK. WE'LL BE BACK WITH MORE OF IT ON THE OTHER SIDE. K WITH MORE OF IN THE OTHER SIDE 20221230224245.791|20221230224554.730",

        "trs": "> WELCOME BACK. LOOKING BACK ON 25 NEWSMAKERS IN POLITICS, BUSINESS, POP CULTURE, ENTERTAINMENT AND SPORTS AND WHETHER THEY WERE UP OR DOWN BY THE END OF THE YEAR. AND DONNY DEUTSCH IS HERE TO TAKE US THROUGH THEM ALL. YIKES. A LOT OF BRAND DOWNS. SOME BRAND UPS.  THE THING IS SOME OF THESE ACTUALLY ARE A BIT OBVIOUS, BUT WHAT MAKES IT SO INTERESTING IS WE'VE GOT DONNY HERE. HE'S GOT THAT SPECIAL SAUCE --  A LITTLE --  REALLY HE WAS -- HE OBVIOUSLY AN ADVERTISING LEGEND, A BRANDING LEGEND. HE'S GOT THE BRANDING, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN OVER TO HIS PLACE --  OH, YAEP.  -- HE'S GOT THE BRANDING SUPER COMPUTER. WE GO TO THIS GUY TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S UP, WHO'S DOWN, AND WHY.  THERE'S ABOUT 27 DANISH SCIENTISTS WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK.  YES.  I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE DANISH BUT SOMEHOW THEY KIND OF GOT TOGETHER. AND THEY WORK AT THE SUPER COMPUTER. THEY USE A GOOGLE MACHINE ALSO. THEY DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. A LOT OF THESE -- A LOT OF TIMES WE DO THIS ON A WEEKLY BASIS, I DO FUNNY THINGS LIKE VELVEETA MARTINIS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. WHEN WE LOOKED AT A YEAR, WE KIND OF HAD TO DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BASICALLY DAY-TO-DAY STALWARTS OF \"MORNING JOE\" AND THINGS WE TALK ABOUT, BUT A YEAR-END WRAP-UP, IT WOULD BE NEGLIGENT NOT TO DO IT.  HE'S SERIOUS. HE'S GOT THE DOUBLE-BREASTED BLAZER ON.  WITH JEANS.  IT IS GAME DAY. EVEN THE CHOICE OF THE DOUBLE OF BREASTED BLAZER, THE DANISH SCIENTISTS IN THEIR JAB COATS WERE THE ONES THAT TOLD HIM TO WEAR THAT. THAT'S ALL WE'RE GOING TO SAY ABOUT THE DANISH SCIENTISTS. WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE. I WANT TO START WITH DONALD TRUMP. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THAT'S OBVIOUS, BUT IT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH A REMARKABLE SIX YEARS, AN EXTRAORDINARY SIX YEARS, AND IT SEEMS THAT THE TRUMP ERA IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE. DONALD TRUMP OBVIOUSLY, DONNIE, LET'S START WITH THE OBVIOUS, BRAND DOWN, RIGHT?  I CAN'T THINK IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS, CULTURE, YOU KNOW, ONE BRAND THAT HAS GONE FROM 60 TO 0 FASTER AND IN A MORE STUNNING FASHION. WE COULD PROBABLY -- BRANDS HAVE WHAT WE CALL BRAND ATTRIBUTES. I WOULD GIVE 25 BRAND ATTRIBUTES, EVERYTHING FROM, YOU KNOW, STEALING THE DOCUMENTS TO HIM ENDORSING JUST ABOUT EVERY LOSING CANDIDATE TO HIS POLL NUMBERS TO THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE POSSIBLY GOING TO BRING HIM UP ON CRIMINAL CHARGES, TO HIS BUSINESS BEING FOUND ON 17 COUNTS, ON EVERY SINGLE JUDGMENT MADE AGAINST HIM, HAVING DINNER WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND ANTI-SEMITES, HIM SHOWING WE SHOULD THROW OUT THE CONSTITUTION. IT IS ENDLESS. THERE IS NO BRAND MORE DOWN IN OUR CULTURE. POLL NUMBERS, 25 POINTS BEHIND DeSANTIS, THE PEOPLE ARE FIGURING IT UP.  SHOWING UP IN THE POLLS. CURRENT PRESIDENT, BRAND UP YOU SAY.  I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CRITICAL OF HIM SAYING HE DOESN'T HAVE HIS MOJO AND WHAT NOT. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PURE BLOCKING ATTACK, THE LEGISLATIVE VICTORIES, WHETHER IT'S THE CHIPS, WHETHER IT'S MANUFACTURING, WHETHER IT'S GUN CONTROL, CLIMATE, BUILD BACK BETTER, THE INFLATION ACT, NO PRESIDENT HAS GOTTEN MORE DONE IN HIS FIRST TERM PROBABLY SINCE FDR, AND YOU ALSO SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS IN TERMS OF HIS COAT TAILS OR THE COATTAILS OF DONALD TRUMP HOW DEMOCRATS HAVE PERFORMED. UNDER THE BRAND OF QUIET COMPETENCY, OF SANITY, OF STABILITY, YOU EACH GOT TO GIVE HIM A MAJOR BRAND UP, I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.  MIKA, WHAT'S SO FASCINATING IS -- AND WE SEE THIS ONCE IN A WHILE, BUT JOE BIDEN'S SUPERPOWER POLITICALLY HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED. I REMEMBER WRITING A COLUMN IN \"THE WASHINGTON POST,\" EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WAS FINISHED AFTER IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND I SAID NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I'M STILL PROUD OF JOE BIDEN. AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED. HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED ON TWITTER GOING INTO THE 2020 CAMPAIGN. THERE WERE PEOPLE ALL AROUND BARACK OBAMA THAT DIDN'T WANT HIM ON AND THEY WOULD TALK TO ANY REPORTER OFF THE RECORD THEY COULD TALKING ABOUT HOW HE WASN'T UP TO THE CHALLENGE. YOU OF COURSE HEARD A LOT OF THE SAME TALK FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS, AGAIN, SAYING THAT THIS GUY WAS TAKING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DOWN AND HE NEEDED TO QUIT. ONCE AGAIN, BRAND UP, HE ALWAYS -- HE ALWAYS BEATS EXPECTATIONS.  DEMOCRATS NEVER AND DIDN'T IN THE MIDTERMS KNOW WHAT THEY HAD IN JOE BIDEN. THEY HAD SOMEONE WHO IS A SKILLED POLITICIAN, WHO'S MADE HIS MISTAKES ALONG THE WAY, ALONG DECADES, WHO'S LEARNED FROM THEM, WHO KNEW EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE CARED ABOUT, DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE POLLS AND HE STAYED FOCUSED ON TWO ISSUES BEFORE THE MIDTERMS, AND IT WAS ABORTION AND DEMOCRACY. AND LIKE A LASER, HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ANYBODY, AND BY THE WAY, PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO CAMPAIGN NEXT TO HIM, COME ON, DEMOCRATS, USE YOUR EYES.  WILLIE, ISN'T IT FUNNY, HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED, AND YOU'D HAVE DEMOCRATS THAT WOULD NOT SAY WHETHER THEY THOUGHT HE SHOULD RUN AGAIN IN COMPETITIVE DEMOCRATIC RACES. IT WAS CRAZY.  THEY'RE STILL SAYING IT. THEY'RE STILL NOT SURE IF THEY WANT HIM TO RUN AGAIN DESPITE BEATING DONALD TRUMP ONCE AND HAD A RUN IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. BRAND UP TO FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DeSANTIS.  YEAH. THE LATEST POLLS -- I'M GOING TO HEDGE THIS BECAUSE BRAND UP WITH THE SUCCESS HE'S HAD, ALL RIGHT. I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE HIS BRAND VERY MUCH. I THINK HE'S GOT A LOT OF DANGEROUS ATTRIBUTES TO HIM. BUT, LOOK, THIS IS THE GUY THAT'S BEEN ABLE TO DO THE DANCE WITH TRUMP AND NOT NECESSARILY ENDORSE IT BUT NOT NECESSARILY COME AFTER, AT SOME POINT IN TIME THE RUBBER WILL HIT THE ROAD. IN THE LATEST POLLS HE'S 20 POINTS AHEAD OF TRUMP, WHICH IS AMAZING. HE WON OVERWHELMINGLY IN FLORIDA. HE SEEMS TO BE THE FAIR-HAIRED BOY. HE HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG. MY CHINK IN THE MORNING, I THINK THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE HE STEPS UP AND SAYS WE NEED TO WIN, GUYS, IT'S ABOUT WINNING, AND I'M GOING TO STAND FOR A LOT OF THINGS YOUR GUY STANDS FOR BUT IN A DIFFERENT WAY, TAKE THE VITRIOL OUT. HE'S CLEARLY THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY. BUT YOU GUYS HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE SHOW A LOT, WE KIND OF HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ON THE BIG STAGE. WE HAVEN'T SEEN CAN HE TAKE A PUNCH. WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM UNDER THE TYPE OF SCRUTINY ON A NATIONAL STAGE. RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM A MAJOR BRAND UP.  AS DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES TO FAILED THERE WILL BE INCREASING CALLS FOR HIM TO JUMP INTO THIS RACE. SEE IF HE DOES IT. BRANDS UP, LIZ CHENEY FOR HER WORK ON THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE.  SHE'S TRULY I THINK THE AMERICAN HERO OF THE YEAR AS FAR AS AMERICANS GO. SHE COST HER JOB. IT'S ONE THING TO GO OUT ON THE LINE AND STAND UP AND TAKE A STAND. IT'S ANOTHER THING WHEN YOU'RE SACRIFICED. THIS IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM WE SEE WITH REPUBLICANS. NOT ONE OF THEM, BECAUSE THEY REALIZE IF THEY STAND UP, A LOT OF THEM LOSE THEIR JOB, AND SHE LOST HER JOB. SHE WILL BE A POLITICIAN ON THE SCENE FOR DECADES TO COME. SHE COULD BE PRESIDENTIAL TIMBER IN THE FUTURE. BUT I THINK THAT HER BRAND IS AS STRONG AS ANY POLITICAL BRAND OUT THERE AND YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE HER KUDOS EVERY WAY, SHAME, OR FORM. SHE PUT ON A STUNNING PERFORMANCE WITH JANUARY 6th.  WE OFTEN HEAR HOW DIVIDED THE ELECTORATE IS, MAYBE THEY ARE. I BROUGHT UP ANTHONY FAUCI A FEW WEEKS BACK, TALKING ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS KEEP BASHING FAUCI. HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON OUT OF 15 PEOPLE POLLED, IN A RECENT POLL, THAT WAS POSITIVE. NUMBER TWO, THE ONE CLOSEST TO ANTHONY FAUCI, LIZ CHENEY.  YEAH. SHE'S DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB OVER THE PAST YEAR ESPECIALLY FOR THE COUNTRY. ON THAT FRONT, SOMEONE YOU COULD SAY MAYBE WAS DOING THE OPPOSITE, DONNY, MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. YOU SAY BRAND DOWN, AND I WONDER IF YOUR FEELINGS DON'T MATCH REALITY HERE BECAUSE SHE'S ACTUALLY GAINING IN POWER.  SHE'S GAINING IN POWER, BUT I THINK SHE'S GOING TO RUN INTO A BUZZ SAW. SHE'S COME OUT WITH EVERYTHING FROM, HEY, IF I WAS IN CHARGE WE WOULD HAVE WON THAT JANUARY 6th, I WOULD HAVE HAD GUNS THERE AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I JUST THINK THAT WE ARE HEADING INTO A MOMENT OF TIME WHERE THAT TYPE OF VITRIOL, THAT TYPE OF HATE, YES, IT GETS YOU MEDIA ATTENTION, BUT I THINK AS THE REPUBLICANS, JOE, YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS, THE LOSING STRAFT JI WITH REPUBLICANS, SHE MADE HER BRAND SO TO SPEAK AS FAR AS AWARENESS AND POPULARITY, A VERY NARROW SEGMENT UP, BUT HER BRAND ON A NATIONAL STAGE MAKING A DIFFERENCE LONG TERM IS LIMITED.  BIG SWAY FOR THE MOMENT, THOUGH, RIGHT, MIKA?  RIGHT.  KEVIN McCARTHY.  THAT'S TRUE. NEVER KEVIN. YOU NEVER KNOW. AND FINALLY, DONNY, NANCY PELOSI, BRAND UP.  YEAH. YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS SHOWED A COUPLE WEEKS IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO JOHN BOEHNER GETTING UP THERE AND CRYING AS HE TALKED ABOUT HER. I DON'T THINK WE'VE HAD AS AN EFFECTIVE SPEAKER IN MY LIFETIME. SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT HER, LIKE HER OR NOT LIKE RANGANA HERATH LEVEL OF COMPETENCY, THE WAY SHE'S KEPT CAUCUSES IN LINE AND KEPT HERSELF IN DIGNITY, YOU HAVE TO TIP EUROPE HAT TO NANCY PELOSI. ONE OF THE GREATEST SPEAKERS OF ALL TIME.  WITHOUT QUESTION. VOTERS, A BRAND UP FOR INDEPENDENT VOTERS. WHY?  GALLUP CAME OUT AND ASKED PEOPLE TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. MORE PEOPLE IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS DEPTHS THAN REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS. THE INDEPENDENTS ARE WHO CAME TO BEAR IN THE LAST ELECTION. THE INDEPENDENTS, I BELIEVE MORE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP, SAVED OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY CAME UP AND SPOKE. I THINK INDEPENDENT AS A BRAND IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW. E V YES, WE ARE A TWO-PARTY SYSTEM, BUT MOST PEOPLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR WARDROBE OF ATTRIBUTES, THEY DON'T LINE UP COMPLETELY WE THEY ARE PARTY. I THINK INDEPENDENT WILL BE A BIGGER BRAND MOVING FORWARD.  REPUBLICANS BLEW WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LAYUP OF MIDTERM ELECTION SEASON, GIVING THEM A BRAND DOWN.  YEAH. YOU KNOW, JOE, YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT ENOUGH. WHAT A LOSING STRATEGY. THE PARTY OF GRIEVANCE, THE PARTY OF NOTHING. EVEN AFTER ALL OF THESE LOSSES, WHAT DO THEY COME FORWARD WITH? HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP. THE REPUBLICANS ARE LOST. THEY CAN'T GET UP. AND THE PROBLEM THEY HAVE GOING FORWARD IS DONALD TRUMP, ALTHOUGH WE SEE HIM DISINTEGRATING AS FAR AS HIS BRAND AND POPULARITY, I DON'T SEE HIM DISAPPEARING, AND I SEE HIM GOING BACK AND RUNNING AS AN INDEPENDENT, A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF INDEPENDENT, AND HE STILL HOLDS THAT BASE. SO, THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. THEY HAVE A MAJOR BRANDING PROBLEM. I THINK IF YOU POLLED 90% OF REPUBLICANS THEY OLD SAY GO AWAY, GOOD-BYE. THEY'RE STUCK WITH HIM AND WITH HIS GRIEVANCE. AND THEY HAVE A PROBLEM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. UNLESS RON DeSANTIS CAN REALLY RESCUE THIS FAR TI, THIS PARTY IS IN DEEP, DEEP TROUBLE.  AND THE PROBLEM IS, AGAIN, PUTTING IT IN DONNY'S TERMS, WE'VE BEEN MICROTARGETING. THEY KEEP MICROTARGETING TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE BUBBLE. THEY KEEP TRYING TO CONVERT THOSE WHO WERE ALREADY CONVERTED. THEY'RE TALKING TO THEMSELVES. AND SO WHEN YOU'RE LOSING THE SUBURBS, WHEN YOU'RE LOSING MIDDLE AMERICA, WHEN YOU'RE LOSING SWING VOTERS, WHEN YOU'RE JUST NOT GOING TO WIN ELECTIONS, AND YET THEY REMAIN FOCUSED ON MICROTARGETING, I THINK THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS ACTUALLY WAS IN ARIZONA, THE FINAL WEEK OF THE MIDTERM CAMPAIGN OUT IN ARIZONA. CARPI LAKE DECIDED TO ATTACK McCAIN VOTERS AND SAID IF YOU'RE A McCAIN VOTER, GET OUT OF HERE. AS A FORMER POLITICIAN, YOU SHUDDER. YOU WANT EVERY VOTE. YOU WANT EVERYBODY ON YOUR SIDE. AND YET THEY KEEP PUSHING PEOPLE AWAY.  YES, THEY DO. ANOTHER ISSUE WHERE THEY DO THAT IS ABORTION, DONNY. IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT POLLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON TO DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS, REPUBLICANS EVEN ARE SPLIT ON ABORTION AND MORE OF THEM ARE FOR WOMEN HAVING THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT. ROE V. WADE, BRAND UP.  YEAH. I THINK THIS WAS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IN THE LAST ELECTION THAN POLLS WERE SHOWING. I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GUT ISSUES. I THINK THIS IS THE TONE DEAFNESS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. OBVIOUSLY, THIS WAS A SUPREME COURT DECISION, NOT PARTY'S DECISION, BUT I THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CAUSE CELEBRE FOR DEMOCRATS. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S UNDERNEATH IT THAT JUST SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT GOING BACKWARDS VERSUS GOING FORWARD. THAT IS A BRAND THAT AS LONG AS THE REPUBLICANS ARE STUCK WITH THE ANTI-ROE V. WADE, THE ROLLBACK OF ROE V. WADE, THEIR BRAND STAYS TARNISHED. YOU HAVE TO INTERLOCK THE TWO OF THEM.  WHILE SOME OF THESE THINGS SEEM OBVIOUS TO US NOW AS WE TALK ABOUT ROE V. WADE, IT'S SHOCKING THAT AMERICANS WOULD RESPOND AS OVERWHELMINGLY AS THEY DID IF YOU LOOKED AT POLLS. IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS, WHERE SWING VOTERS WERE, IT'S SURPRISING TO SEE HOW DRAMATIC THE BACKLASH WAS. OUR LAST BRAND UP, BRAND DOWN OF THIS SEGMENT --  GLOBAL.  -- IS GLOBAL. IF YOU GO BACK A YEAR, IT'S VERY SAFE TO SAY LITERALLY NOBODY WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING EVEN UKRAINIANS. VLADIMIR PUTIN, BRAND WAY DOWN. ZELENSKYY, BRAND WAY UP. NOBODY COULD HAVE IMAGINED WHEN THOSE TANKS STARTED ROLLING IN AND PEOPLE BELIEVED THE UKRAINIANS WOULD COLLAPSE IN THREE, FOUR, FIVE DAYS, NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE WOULD BE TALKING AND THIS IS WHERE THE ARROWS WOULD BE POINTING.  IT REALLY UNEARTHED AND TOOK THE EMPEROR'S CLOTHES OFF RUSSIA AS FAR AS NOT BEING A SUPERPOWER AND CERTAINLY IT'S A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY IN SO MANY WAYS. IF THEY WOULD CHOOSE SIDES ON THE BEGINNING AND SAID UKRAINE OR RUSSIA, IT WOULD BE A NO-BRAINER. ZELENSKYY HAS BEEN SO PITCH PERFECT IN THE WAY HE'S HANDLED THE MEDIA. THIS GOES BACK TO JOE BIDEN -- I DIDN'T BRING THIS UP WITH HIS BRAND, THE NATO COALITION HE PUT TOGETHER. ZELENSKYY WAS \"TIME\" MAGAZINE'S MAN OF THE YEAR, RIGHTFULLY SO. PUTIN HAS BEEN DAMAGED, HURT BRAND. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS EXIT RAMP IS OFF BUT ZELENSKYY IS AN INTERNATIONAL HERO AND I THINK \"TIME\" MAGAZINE HAD IT COMPLETELY RIGHT. > STILL AHEAD, DONNY GIVES US THE TRENDS FOR SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN BUSINESS, SPORTS, AND ENTERTAINMENT. 20221230143052.649|20221230143443.780",

IT'S A LIVE LOOK AT THE FRIDAY BEFORE IN TIMES SQUARE WHERE THAT BALL WILL DROP TOMORROW NIGHT ON WHAT WE'RE TOLD WILL BE A BALMY NEW YEAR'S EVE IN TIMES SQUARE. > NOW WITH TWO DAYS LEFT IN THE YEAR, WE'RE TAKING A LOOK BACK AT THE BIGGEST STORIES THAT SHAPED AN EVENTFUL 2022. HERE'S NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT, JOE FRYER.  THE HEADLINES THAT DEFINED 2022 WERE SEISMIC AND HISTORIC. EUROPE'S LARGEST ARMED CONFLICT SINCE WORLD WAR II. A SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT OVERTURNED MORE THAN FOUR DECADES OF PRECEDENT, THE DEATH OF A MONARCH WHO HAD REIGNED FOR 70 YEARS. YET, IN ITS EARLIEST DAYS, 2022 SEEMED MORE LIKE A COPY CAT, MIMICKING THE WORST QUALITY OF THE TWO PREVIOUS YEARS.  NOW TO THOSE STAGGERING NEW COVID NUMBERS. DAILY CASES SURPASSING 1 MILLION.  Reporter: AS THE NEW YEAR BEGAN, OUR FIGHT WITH COVID STUBBORNLY RAGED ON.  A LOT OF THEM ARE REALLY SICK.  Reporter: WITH THE RAPIDLY SPREADING OMICRON VARIANT KILLING 60,000 AMERICANS IN JANUARY. THOUGH WITH TIME, THE PANDEMIC DID LOOSEN ITS GRIP.  THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION WILL NO LONGER ENFORCE THE FEDERAL MANDATE REQUIRING MASKS ON ALL U.S. AIRPORTS AND ON FOREIGN AIRCRAFT.  Reporter: AS MASK MANDATES VANISHED.  THANK YOU. WE CAN BREATHE AGAIN! WE WERE SO HAPPY.  Reporter: BUT NEW THREATS EMERGED.  THERE IS GROWING CONCERN ABOUT ANOTHER VIRUS CALLED MONKEYPOX.  Reporter: MONKEYPOX, FLU, THE RESPIRATORY VIRUS RSV.  IT'S A SERIOUS ILLNESS WITH HIM BEING THIS YOUNG.  Reporter: OVERSEAS, IT WAS A DIFFERENT BATTLE THAT RATTLED THE WORLD. IN FEBRUARY, RUSSIA STORMED INTO UKRAINE WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS, ONLY TO BE MET BY A RESILIENT FOE AND ITS INSPIRING LEADER, PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY REFUSED TO FLEE. THE STRIKES PUSHED UKRAINIANS TO BOMB SHELTERS AND TO THE COUNTRY'S SWOLLEN BORDER.  YOU HEAR THE WHISTLES AND FAMILIES THAT HAVE COME WITH ALL OF THEIR BELONGINGS AND PEOPLE ARE HUGGING AND SAYING GOOD-BYE AND NOT SURE IF THEY WILL EVER COME BACK.  Reporter: MILLIONS OF UKRAINIANS SUDDENLY BECAME REFUGEES. BUT AS THE YEAR PROGRESSED, UKRAINE'S MILITARY TOOK BACK LAND THAT HAD BEEN LOST JUST MONTHS EARLIER. STEADY PROGRESS IN A LONG WAR, NOW DOCTORING THE DARK DAYS OF WINTER. IN AMERICA, WINTER STORMED IN EARLY.  WE'VE SEEN OVER 50 INCHES OF SNOW IN UNDER 24 HOURS. A RECORD-BREAKING SNOWSTORM DUMPED NEARLY 7 FEET OF SNOW ON THE BUFFALO REGION, WHILE IN FLORIDA, HURRICANE IAN PUMMELED THE COAST WITH WINDS THAT REACHED 155 MILES AN HOUR.  YOU CAN'T WITHSTAND THIS KIND OF STUFF.  Reporter: JUST SHY OF A CATEGORY 5.  THESE CARS WERE ALL NICELY PARKED AND THEY'RE NOW ALL FLOATING FREELY.  Reporter: IT WOULD BE FLORIDA'S DEADLIEST HURRICANE SINCE 1935. GUN VIOLENCE CONTINUED TO DEVASTATE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NATION WITH HUNDREDS OF MASS SHOOTINGS.  WE ALL RAN TO THE BACK. HE WAS SHOOTING AT THE MILK.  Reporter: TEN WERE KILLED AT A SUPERMARKET IN BUFFALO, SEVEN AT A FOURTH OF JULY PARADE IN HIGHLAND PARK, ILLINOIS. FIVE WERE MURDERED IN A LGBTQ NIGHTCLUB IN COLORADO SPRINGS. AND AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN UVALDE, TEXAS --  CAN YOU TELL THE POLICE TO COME TO MY ROOM?  I'VE ALREADY TOLD THEM TO COME TO THE ROOM. WE'RE TRYING TO GET SOMEONE TO YOU.  Reporter: 19 YOUNG CHILDREN AND TWO TEACHERS LOST THEIR LIVES WHEN A TEENAGE GUNMAN RAVAGED THEIR CAMPUS.  YOU KNOW, HOW DID HE GET IN THERE?  Reporter: ADDING TO THEIR GRIEF, QUESTIONS OVER LAW ENFORCEMENT'S DELAYED RESPONSE. [ CHANTING: HANDS OFF ]  EMOTIONS WERE HIGH ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHEN IN JUNE THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNED ROE V. WADE.  I FEEL LIKE I GOT PUNCHED IN THE STOMACH THIS MORNING.  Reporter: FOR SOME, THERE WAS ANGER AND FEAR.  WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE TREATED AS SECOND CLASS CITIZENS.  Reporter: FOR OTHERS, IT WAS A CELEBRATORY MOMENT DECADES IN THE MAKING.  THIS IS AN AMAZING VICTORY.  THE RIGHT TO LIFE HAS BEEN VINDICATED. THE VOICELESS WILL FINALLY HAVE A VOICE.  Reporter: ABORTION WAS ONE OF MANY ISSUES DOMINATING POLITICS IN 2022. SO WAS INFLATION, WHICH REACHED 40-YEAR HIGHS.  IN EVERY ASPECT, IT'S HIGHER. YOU KNOW, BUT YOUR WAGES DON'T GO UP ANY HIGHER.  Reporter: IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER MONTHS, THE NATIONAL AVERAGE FOR GAS SOARED.  $5 A GALLON IS CRAZY.  Reporter: WHILE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATING DROPPED. DESPITE THAT, DEMOCRATS WERE ABLE TO FEND OFF A RED WAVE DURING THE MIDTERMS.  NBC NEWS IS NOW PROJECTING THAT DEMOCRATS WILL MAINTAIN CONTROL OF THE SENATE.

JOE FRYER, NBC NEWS.  SO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THE YEAR THAT WE ARE LEAVING BUT YOU LOCK BACK AT THAT SEGMENT ON THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS AND STRUCK AGAIN BY THE SCOPE OF THEM. WHETHER A SCHOOL IN UVALDE OR A SHOOTING AT A PARADE OR A CLUB Q WHY THAT SCOURGE STAYS WITH US FOR ANOTHER YEAR.  WILLIE, EVERY YEAR I AM ALWAYS AMAZED THAT SCHOOL SHOOTINGS AND SENSELESS SHOOTINGS THAT TAKE THE LIVES OF SO MANY YOUNG TEN FINISH IN THE TOP TEN OF THE BIGGEST STORIES OF THE YEAR WHEN IT IS THE NUMBER ONE STORY. THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SANDY HOOK SHOOTING. UVALDE. WE SWIM THROUGH A SOCIETY FILLED WITH GUNS, A NIAGARA OF HANDGUNS IN THIS COUNTRIES AND ALONGSIDE POLITICIANS WITH LACK OF COMMON SENSE WITH THE ANNUAL REFUSAL TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THAT TO ME IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE NUMBER ONE STORY OF OUR FLAWED CULTURE UNTIL WE ADDRESS IT.  TEN YEARS LATER ANOTHER SANDY HOOK IN THIS COUNTRY IN UVALDE. THE WAR IN UKRAINE AN INTERNATIONAL STORY THAT'S AN AMERICAN STORY AS PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS STOOD AT THE SIDE OF PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY AND PLEDGED SUPPORT AND GIVEN SUPPORT WITH HIM ASKING AMERICA TO STAY BY THE SIDE OF THE AMERICAN.  A MASSIVE WAR IN EUROPE. THERE ARE PREDICTIONS THAT RUSSIA WOULD TAKE KYIV IN A MATTER OF DAYS. THE UKRAINIAN FLAG FLYING PROUDLY OVER KYIV AS THE FORCES HAVE SHOWED RESILIENCE AND BRAVERY WITH HELP FROM THE U.S. AND THE WEST TO REPEL RUSSIA AND AS THE YEAR DRAWS TO A CLOSE STILL IN CONTROL OF MOST 0 OF THAT COUNTRY BUT A WAR THAT SHOWS NO SIGNS OF ENDING. WHAT STANDS OUT TO YOU?  I HAVE TO SAY THAT THE HATE CRIMES, AGAINST BLACKS AS THE SHOOTING IN BUFFALO, TEN PEOPLE AT A SUPERMARKET KILLED. I PREACHED TWO OF THE FUNERALS. AND THEN THE SHOOTINGS AT SYNAGOGUES AND THE SHOOTINGS OF LGBTQ PEOPLE AT PLACES. LATINOS. BRINGING THE HATE SUMMIT AT THE WHITE HOUSE THAT I GIVE THE PRESIDENT CREDIT FOR WORKING WITH US. HATE CRIMES ON THE RISE. IT'S STILL WITH US AND WE SHOULD NOT FORGET THAT.  AS WE ARE AT THE PENULTIMATE DAY OF 2022 WHAT STANDS OUT FOR YOU?  WHEN I THINK ABOUT WHAT BEFB THROUGH IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, BARELY SURVIVING THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY AND THEN COVID, UNEMPLOYMENT, RISE IN HATE CRIMES. IT IS OVERWHELM JEFF GORDON THE WAR IN UKRAINE. I THINK THERE'S A REASON FOR HOPE. THIS IS THE YEAR THAT DEMOCRACY FOUGHT BACK BOTH IN UKRAINE, HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. DENYING ELECTION DENIERS OFFICE. THERE'S ROOM FOR HOPE. THERE'S A SAYING THAT I HOLD CLOSE TO MY HEART FROM MART LOOUT KING WHICH IS WE MAY NOT BE WHERE WE WANT TO BE BUT THANK GOD WE AIN'T WHAT WE WAS. THAT'S WHAT I'M FEELING. WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO.  THAT'S WELL SAID. AS YOU SAID PEOPLE TURNING PEOPLE BACK. I WANT TO ADD IN REASON FOR JOY AND HOPE AND THAT IS AARON JUDGE RETURNING TO THE BRONX WITH THE YANKEES AND THE RED SOX DOING NOTHING TO IMPROVE THEIR LOT. THANK YOU FOR THAT.  YEAH. AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THAT ONE.  ALL RIGHT. NEXT HERE, NEW YORK CITY MAYOR ADAMS WILL JOIN US. TO TALK ABOUT WHAT'S NEXT FOR MORE THAN 8.5 MILLION RESIDENTS LIVING IN HIS CITY. \"MORNING JOE\" WILL BE RIGHT BACK. > BEAUTIFUL LIVE PICTURE AT 8:00 ON THE BUTTON IN NEW YORK CITY. WELCOME BACK TO \"MORNING JOE\" ON THIS FRIDAY, DECEMBER 30th. IT IS OUR FINAL \"MORNING JOE\" OF 2022. JONATHAN, MARA, REVEREND AL ALL STILL WITH US. IT WAS ONE YEAR AGO THIS WEEKEND WHEN THIS TOOK PLACE IN TIME SQUARE.  I WILL FAITHFULLY DISCHARGE THE DUTIES OF THE OFFICE OF THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK ACCORDING TO THE BEST OF MY EIGHTIES SO HELP ME GOD.  CONGRATULATIONS!  NEW YORK CITY MAYOR ERIC ADAMS SWORN IN AFTER THIS YEAR'S BALL DROP IN TIMES SQUARE WITH A FRAILED PICTURE OF HIS MOTHER DOROTHY WHILE VOWING TO CARRY OUT THE DUTIES ASIA MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY. HE JOINS YOU NOW. WE HAVE A TABLE OF PEOPLE TO ASK YOU QUESTIONS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLING WHICH IS PULL SAFETY, A FORMER NEW YORK CITY COP WHO PROMISED TO CHANGE THE WAY THE CITY FEELS, CRIME IS UP 23%. MURDERS AND SHOOTINGS ARE DOWN. YOU PROMISED MORE STRONGER POLICING IN 2023 TO GET AT THOSE NUMBERS. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU?  LET'S GO BACK TO JANUARY AND FEBRUARY. WE WERE UP IN THE MAJOR CRIME CATEGORIES BY 40%. WHEN YOU LOOK NOW YOU SEE A TREND DOWN 20%. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAST ALMOST EIGHT WEEKS YOU SEE A CONTINUOUS SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE. THE SEEDS WE PLANTED TO ALLOWED ME TO DO THE NUMBER ONE FOCUS. SHOOTINGS AND HOMICIDES DOWN. LOOK AT THE TRANSIT SYSTEM. 6.3 CRIMES A DAY. THAT IS THE LOWEST NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN DECADES SO WE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. POLICE ARE RESPONDING ACCORDINGLY AND WE ARE MOVING IN A PLACE WE NEED TO BE. THE BIG PROBLEM IS A CATCH RELEASE REPEAT SYSTEM. APPROXIMATELY 1, 600 PEOPLE REPEAT OFFENDERS. ARRESTED FOR GUN CHARGES THEY ARE BACK ON THE STREETS. IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE.  YOU LED ME TO THE NEXT QUESTION. WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE STATE OF ILLINOIS AND COOK COUNTY GETTING RID OF CASH BAIL IN THE NEW YEAR. WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE ABOUT THAT LAW SO YOU DON'T HAVE POLICE OFFICERS SAYING WE ARRESTED THIS GUY YESTERDAY AND SAW HIM COMMITTING A CRIME ON THE SUBWAY TODAY? HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT?  WE PINPOINT THE PROBLEM. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S CALLED THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM, THESE WERE MY BILLS AND THE BILLS I SPONSORED AND LOOKED FORWARD TO IN THE STATE SENATE. IT WAS ABOUT FIXING A BROKEN SYSTEM BUT ZERO IN ON THE RECIDIVISTS. APPROXIMATELY 1,640 PEOPLE ARE ARRESTED. WE HAD A PERSON WHO SHOT THREE INDIVIDUALS. HE HAD A LONG ARREST RECORD OUT ON PROBATION OR BAIL FOR WHAT HIS ACTIONS WERE. THAT IS WHAT IS FEEDING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROBLEM. NOT ONLY IN NEW YORK BUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. THE REPEATED OFFENDERS. THAT'S MY FIGHT WHEN I RETURN TO ALBANY TO SAY ZERO IN ON THE RECIDIVISTS AN ENTWEAK THE LAW.  MAYOR ADAMS, AS YOU DEAL WITH THE RECIDIVISM, AT ONE LEVEL YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH PROTECTING PEOPLE THAT CAN'T AFFORD TO BE TREATED JUSTLY IN TERMS OF REFORM AND A REASON THAT WE SAID THAT MANY OF THE TOP BLACK LAWMAKERS SHOULD HAVE A SUMMIT BECAUSE IT IS HOW DO YOU STRUCK THE MIDDLE OF TRYING TO GET THIS DONE WHERE WE DON'T SACRIFICE PEOPLES' LIBERTIES BASED ON THE ECONOMIC STANDING BUT DON'T HAVE THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SUBJECTED TO VIOLENT CRIMINALS. WE HAVE GONE DOWN IN HIGH AREAS BUT WE COULD GO DOWN MORE IF WE GOT ON A UNIFIED PAGE.  SO TRUE. IT IS ABOUT JUSTICE. IT IS NOT JUST PROSECUTING AND I STATED THIS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND LIVE THROUGH IT NOW. INTERVENTION PREVENTION. WHEN YOU ZERO IN THE D.A.s DON'T HAVE THE ATTORNEYS. THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH ATTORNEYS. THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE. THERE'S NEVER BEEN A MAYOR IN THE HISTORY OF THIS CITY DOING MORE IN THE PREVENTION AREA LIKE I AM. SUMMER YOUTH JOBS. EVERY DONE BEFORE IN HISTORY. FACING FOR TUITION FOR FOSTER CARE CHILDREN. PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SCHOOL. WHAT WE DID WITH THE SUMMER RISING PROGRAM. 110,000 CHILDREN WENT TO SCHOOL IN THE SYSTEMER TO CATCH UP. WE ARE PARTNERING WITH BLOCKCHAIN TO HAVE THE GREEN JOBS AVAILABLE. CONNECTING THEM WITH PROBATION OFFICERS. I VISIT REICHERS PRISON MORE THAN ANY OTHER MAYOR AND SEE THE PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION PLAN.  DON'T WE NEED MORE RESOURCES IN PREVENTION AS WELL AS MORE RESOURCES IN TERMS OF PEOPLE TO DEFEND PEOPLE THAT NEED DEFENSE LIKE LEGAL AID IS NOT FUNDED A LOT. DON'T WE NEED A LOT MORE RESOURCES IN THE RIGHT PLACE RATHER THAN CATCH IT AT THE END OF WHAT HAPPENS THAT IS SOMETIMES UGLY AND UNFAIR?  WITHOUT A DOUBT. ONCE A PERSON HAS A GUN IN HIS HAND WE HAVE ALREADY FAILED AND THAT'S WHAT BEEN HAPPENING. MY POLICIES ARE BASED ON THE LIFE I LIVED. I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE ARRESTED AND DYSLEXIC. YOU HAVE A MAYOR THAT LIVED THE LIFE OF PEOPLE LIVING RIGHT NOW. OUR CITY AND CHICAGO WE HAVE BEEN INUNDATED WITH CRISES WE DID NOT CREATE. EL PASO WOULD NOT BE GOING THROUGH THIS. THIS IS A NATIONAL PROBLEM AND NEEDS A NATIONAL RESPONSE WHY 31,000 PEOPLE AT OUR DOORSTEP AND I HAD TO DEAL WITH MAKE SURE THEY WERE NOT ON THE STREETS, GOT FOOD, HOUSING, EDUCATION FOR THE CHILDREN.  I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT HOMELESSNESS IN THE CITY. THE STATS ARE STAGGERING FROM THE COALITION FOR THE HOMELESS. 22,000 SINGLE ADULTS IN SHELTERS A FEW WEEKS AGO. NEW YORKERS IN SHELTERS UP 35% AND A SENSE THAT THE HOMELESS IN NEW YORK HIGHEST SENSE THE GREAT DEPRESSION. YOU UNVEILED A NEW PLAN BUT CRITICS SAY THAT POLICE OFFICERS WHO YOU HAVE EMPOWERED TO MAKE THAT DECISION ARE THE WRONG PEOPLE FOR THAT JOB. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE? GIVE US THE PLAN TO BATTLE HOMELESSNESS.  LET'S PEEL BACK THE LAYERS. I THINK IT IS UNFAIR TO REPORT A CLEAR APPROPRIATE TO THOSE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESS THAT CANNOT TAKE CARE OF BASIC NEEDS. THAT IS WHO WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE INVOLUNTARILY BRINGING TO THE HOSPITAL TO DO A PROPER DIAGNOSIS. IT IS INHUMANE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE ON THE STREET THAT CANNOT TAKE CARE OF BASIC NEEDS AND IN DANGER TO THEMSELVES. ANYONE WITH A MENTAL HEALTH AND SWEEPED UP TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL IS UNTRUE. TO ALLOW PEOPLE WITH SEVERE ILLNESS, IF THEY WANT THEM ON THE STREET THAT IS INHUMANE AND NOT GOING TO HAPPEN UNDER MY ADMINISTRATION. I STATED THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO ALLOW ENCAMPMENTS. WE REMOVED THE ENCAMPMENTS ON THE SUBWAY SYSTEM AND THE STREETS. HUMAN WASTE, DRUG -- BIPOLAR. THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE. THE OTHER MISTRUTH IS THAT THIS IS NOT A POLICE LED INITIATIVE. WE SAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. WE HAVE OUTREACH WORKERS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT REACH OUT. DO YOU NEED THE POLICE? A CALL, A MOTHER CALLED FOR HER SON DEALING WITH A MAN TALL HEALTH ILLNESS. THE YOUNG MAN STABBED HIS MOTHER AND THE POLICE OFFICER. THESE ARE REAL ISSUES AND NOT JUST A COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH. LASTLY THE HOMELESS ISSUE IS A REAL ISSUE. WE KNOW FAR TOO WELL IN NEW YORK CITY WE ARE RIGHT TO SHELTER CITY TO GIVE EVERYONE SHELTER WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS BUILD MORE HOUSING. OFFICIALS SAY DON'T BUILD ON MY BLOCK OR DISTRICT. THE HOUSING ISSUE IS A CITY WIDE ISSUE AND CANNOT BE A SACRED PLACE. UNITS IN WILLIS POINTS. UNITS IN THE BRONX THAT DID NOT HAVE THEM. UNITS IN PARTS OF MANHATTAN TO REZONE. WE KNOW THE ISSUE AND THE ONLY WAY TO COMBAT IT IS TO BUILD MORE HOUSING AND THAT'S WHAT WE WILL DO IN THIS ADMINISTRATION.  HAPPY NEW YEAR.  SAME TO YOU.  THANK YOU. IT IS VERY EASY AS MAYOR TO BE BOGGED DOWN AND EACH MAYOR CERTAINLY DEALT WITH A SHARE BUT YOU HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE A YEAR. MAYOR deBLASIO LAUNCHED A PRE-K INITIATIVE. IS THERE AN INITIATIVE THAT YOU HOPE TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT NEW YORKERS CAN FEEL?  YEAH. THINK ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT. YOU ARE RIGHT. FIRST MAYOR IN THE HISTORY WITH DYSLEXIA SCREENING. IT MEAN THAT IS THAT 30 TO 40% RESIDENTS AT RIKERS ISLAND ARE DYSLEXIC. FIRST MAYOR TO GET THE LAND TRUST PASSED TO GET REAL ECONOMICS IN TO THE HOUSING PLAN. NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE. MANY PEOPLE TRIED BUT THEY FAILED. EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT FOR FAMILIES THAT NEED MONEY IN THE POCKETS. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO CHILD CARE. SOMETHING THAT'S A NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT PARENTS CAN'T GET BACK TO WORK AND ADEQUATE CHILD CARE. UNIVERSAL. CHILDREN WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISABILITIES GETTING CHILD CARE SEATS WHERE THEY CAN GET THE SAME THING THAT OTHER CHILDREN WERE NOT GETTING. I DON'T WANT TO BE KNOWN BY ONE PERSON IN A BROKEN SYSTEM BUT A MAYOR TO TURN THIS AROUND AND THAT'S WHAT WE SEE EVERY DAY.  MR. MAYOR, WHAT'S TOMORROW NIGHT GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN TIMES SQUARE? LOOKS LIKE A WARM NIGHT. MAYBE RAIN BUT WARM OUT THERE. YOU CONFIDENT IT WILL BE A SECURE AND CELEBRATORY NIGHT IN TIMES SQUARE?  WHEN YOU REFLECT ON THIS ADMINISTRATION YEAR TO GIVE IT A PROPER ANALYSIS WE NEVER LIVED IN JUST SURVIVING BUT THRIVING. A COVID PROCESS. A PROBLEM. AN ISSUE WITH CRIME SURGING. AN ECONOMY THAT WAS IN A TERRIBLE STATE. YOU SEE A COVER RI. WE INHERITED AN ECONOMIC CHALLENGE AND LOOKING AT THOSE THINGS AND WE CONTINUE TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD AND WILL BRING IN THE NEW YEAR. 2022 WAS MY ROOKIE YEAR. 2023 IS MY AARON JUDGE YEAR. I LOOK FORWARD TO BRING IT BACK.  THE BAR IS SET HIGH. NEW YORK CITY MAYOR ERIC ADAMS, CONGRATULATIONS ON ONE YEAR IN OFFICE.  HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU ALL.  THANK YOU. > GOOD NEWS THIS MORNING FOR SOUTHWEST AIRLINES. THE COMPANY IS EXPECTED IT SAYS TO RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATIONS AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF KANS LAEGSS AND DELAYS. CORRESPONDENT BLAYNE ALEXANDER HAS MORE.  Reporter: PLANNING TO FLY SOME 4,000 FLIGHTS TODAY ON THE HEELS OF AN UNPRECEDENTED WEEK THAT LEFT MORE THAN 15,000 FLIGHTS GROUNDED AND STRANDED PASSENGERS.  EVERY FLIGHT WAS OVERBOOKED.  Reporter: AFTER THE MELTDOWN COMES THE MAKEUP WITH SOUTHWEST PROMISING TO RETURN LOST LUGGAGE TO PASSENGERS, SHIPPING BAGS FOR FREE, EVEN FLYING THEM ON THEIR OWN PLANES, AND SETTING UP A SPECIAL WEBSITE FOR PASSENGERS TO SUBMIT RECEIPTS TO GET REIMBURSED FOR HOTELS, FOOD AND RENTAL CARS WHILE STRANDED. IT'S SOMETHING TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY PETE BUTTIGIEG PROMISED TO ENFORCE.  WE ARE GOING TO BE PUTTING SOUTHWEST AIRLINES UNDER A MICROSCOPE IN TERMS OF THEIR DELIVERING THESE KINDS OF REIMBURSEMENTS AND REFUNDS TO PASSENGERS.  Reporter: IN A SCATHING NEW LETTER TO THE AIRLINE CEO BUTTIGIEG LAYS OUT PRIORITIES FOR THE AIRLINE TO ITS CUSTOMERS FROM PAYING $3,800 TO EACH PASSENGER WITH PROVABLE DAMAGES FROM LOST LUGGAGE TO REPAYING THE COST OF FLIGHTS BOOKED ON OTHER AIRLINES. BUTTIGIEG SAYS HIS DEPARTMENT WILL USE THE FULLEST EXTENT OF ITS INVESTIGATIVE AND ENFORCEMENT POWERS TO HOLD SOUTHWEST ACCOUNTABLE.  THE AIRLINE SAID TO ME THEY WERE GOING TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT'S REQUIRED OF THEM. I AM LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THEY ACTUALLY DO THAT, AND IF THEY DON'T WE ARE IN A POSITION TO LEVY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER VIOLATION, PER PASSENGER IN FINES.  Reporter: DOES YOUR DEPARTMENT SHARE ANY BLAME IN THIS? SHOULD YOU HAVE SEEN THIS COMING?  WE HAVE TAKEN EVERY STEP TO INCREASE THE STANDARD OF CUSTOMER SERVICE RIGHT NOW. NOW, I CAN'T GO IN AND FIX AN I.T. SYSTEM FOR AN INDIVIDUAL AIRLINE THAT IS FAILING TO DO ITS JOB, BUT AS A WATCHDOG OUR DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO DO EVERYTHING IT TAKES TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.  LET'S HOPE TODAY IS A BETTER DAY FOR SOUTHWEST PASSENGERS. NBC'S BLAYNE ALEXANDER REPORTING THERE > STILL AHEAD ON \"MORNING JOE,\" CONGRESSMAN-ELECT GEORGE SANTOS UNDER FEDERAL INVESTIGATION.

        "trs": "> AS THE FINAL DAYS OF 2022 COME TO AN END, WE WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE WOMEN WHO BROKE BARRIERS, STOOD UP TO INJUSTICE AND TRAIL BLAZED A PATH FOR OTHERS DESPITE IMMENSE CHALLENGES THIS YEAR. WOMEN AT HOME AND ABROAD HAVE FOUGHT TO SAVE DEMOCRACY AND THEIR OWN FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS. FROM THE BALLOT BOX TO THE STREETS OF IRAN TO THE BATTLEFIELDS IN UKRAINE. MAKE NO MISTAKE. WOMEN WERE AT THE FRONT LINES OF IT ALL. FRONT LINES OF IT ALL. JOINING US NOW FOR OUR YEAR IN REVIEW IS CEO OF ALL IN TOGETHER, LAUREN LEADER, MSNBC HOST JASMINE JOINS US AND THE NONPROFIT NEWSROOM FOCUSED ON GENDER, POLICY, AND POLITICS. WHAT A GREAT PANEL. THANKS FOR BEING WITH ME. LAUREN, START US OFF AND TALK ABOUT THE MIDTERMS AND HOW WOMEN REALLY SHOWED THEIR POWER, ESPECIALLY WITH ABORTION TURNING OUT TO BE ONE OF THE PREVAILING ISSUES THAT DROVE VOTERS.  I THINK THE LESSON OF THE 2022 MIDTERMS IS DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF WOMEN. ALL OVER IS UPER, PUNDITS WERE SAYING THAT OTHER ISSUES WERE GOING TO BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ABORTION BUT WOMEN SAID NO. IT'S WHAT MOTIVATED THEM TO REGISTER TO VOTE, ESPECIALLY YOUNGER WOMEN, AND FOR WOMEN OVERALL ACROSS THE SPECTRUM, IT DROVE THEM TO THE POLLS AND DELIVERED ELECTION RESULTS TO THE DEMOCRATS THAT REALLY VERY FEW PEOPLE EXCEPT MAYBE THE WOMEN WHO WERE PAYING ATTENTION EXPECTED.  ERINN HAINES, IF YOU LOOK AT WHITMER, HOCHUL, THE KANSAS GOVERNOR, PENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRATIC ATTORNEY GENERAL JOSH SHAPIRO, ALL OF THESE PEOPLE CAMPAIGNED AND WON ON THE ABORTION RIGHTS PLATFORM.  THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. TO LAUREN'S POINT, IF YOU WERE PAYING ATTENTION, YOU KNEW THIS WOULD BE AN ISSUE BECAUSE ABORTION WAS ON THE BALLOT. YOU MENTIONED GRETCHEN WHITMER, WHO TOLD HER STORY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT RESONATED WITH VOTERS. YOU HAD EVEN MALE CANDIDATES IN PENNSYLVANIA, ABORTION WAS ON THE BALLOT IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE, IN THE SENATE RACE, FETTERMAN AND SHAPIRO SAYING THEY WERE GOING TO PROTECT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AS AN ISSUE. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I THINK, YOU KNOW, FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE PREDICTING A RED WAVE, THEY WERE NOT PREDICTING THAT ABORTION WAS GOING TO REMAIN FRONT AND CENTER.  IT'S SO WEIRD BECAUSE A LOT OF THE POLLS WERE NOT SHOWING ABORTION AS A TOP-TOOEFR ISSUE.  YEAH.  SO WE WERE SORT OF WATCHING THIS PLAY OUT IN REAL TIME WHERE PEOPLE LITERALLY TOLD US WITH THEIR VOTES WHAT MATTERED, AND 12 WOMEN NOW WILL SERVE AS GOVERNORS UP FROM 9 IN 2004, SO WOMEN'S ISSUES WERE THE TOP OF THE BALLOT AND A LOT OF WOMEN RAN FOR OFFICE.  MIKA, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ON AIR ABOUT TWO WEEKS OUT FROM THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WAS TALKING ABOUT ABORTION RIGHTS BEING ONE OF THE INTEGRAL ISSUES GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS AND THERE WAS A LOT OF CRITICISM ESPECIALLY ON AIR AS WHY THE PRESIDENT WASN'T ADDRESSING THE ECONOMY BECAUSE THE ECONOMY WAS THE NUMBER-ONE ISSUE FOR VOTERS, GAS PRICES AND INFLATION. BUT ABORTION PROVED TO BE THE NUMBER-ONE ISSUE. I WAS THERE IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT WHEN ROE WAS IN FACT OVERTURNED. I SPOKE TO NOT ONLY LAWMAKERS THERE IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT BUT PROTESTERS AS WELL TALKING ABOUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MAINTAIN THIS MOMENTUM TO THE MIDTERMS, AND I THOUGHT, CONSIDERING THE WAY HISTORY PLAYS OUT, THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE PRETTY M POSSIBLE. BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE A LOT OF OPTIMISM THEY COULD DO THAT. IN FACT, THEY DID, AND KANSAS KST WAS KIND OF THE FIRST INDICATION THAT WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAPPEN. I WENT TO PENNSYLVANIA A COUPLE WEEKS OUT, TALKED TO A LOT OF WOMEN VOTERS ON THE GROUND IN PENNSYLVANIA, TALKED ABOUT ABORTION RIGHTS AS WELL.  THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT. FOR A LOT OF WOMEN, THESE ISSUES WERE LINKED. ABORTION IS ALSO AN ECONOMIC ISSUE.  SURE IS.  WOMEN WHO NEED ACCESS TO ABORTION CARE ARE MOTHERS.  I WANT TO END BY PULLING BACK AND LOOK AT THE GLOBE. YASMIN, MAYBE WE CAN START WITH YOU QUICKLY ON THE WOMEN OF IRAN AND THEIR FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS AND THE WOMEN WHO-IN UKRAINE WHO ARE FIGHTING IN A DIFFERENT WAY ON A DIFFERENT BATTLEFIELD, BUT, WOW, ARE WOMEN EVER STEPPING UP FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR COUNTRIES.  THOSE TWO STORIES ARE ABSOLUTELY CONNECTED, RIGHT. AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY THE IRANIAN DIASPORA IN THE UNITED STATES, THINK ABOUT THIS, GUYS, THIS IS THE FIRST FEMALE REVOLUTION EVER. THEY'RE CALLING IT A REVOLUTION THAT'S HAPPENING IN IRAN. THESE ARE MILLIONS OF WOMEN EVERY SINGLE DAY MONTHS IN NOW PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE BECAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE IT IS TIME TO HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS. THEY RECOGNIZE A CHANGE NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN THE COUNTRY OF IRAN. THEY ARE LEADING THIS FIGHT MORE SO THAN ANYBODY ELSE. PEOPLE ASK WHAT IS NEXT? WHAT CAN REALLY HAPPEN? CAN THIS TOPPLE THE GOVERNMENT OF IRAN? WHATEVER THE ULTIMATE END GOAL IS, THAT COUNTRY IS NEVER GOING BACK TO WHAT IT WAS, EVEN JUST THREE MONTHS AGO. THESE ARE WOMEN GOING OUT INTO THE STREETS WITH JEANS AND T-SHIRTS ON AND NO HEAD SCARF. IT IS ASTOUNDING TO THINK ABOUT THAT REALITY FOR MYSELF, AN IRANIAN-AMERICAN WOMAN, WHO KNOWS HOW THAT GOVERNMENT OPERATES AND HOW BRUTAL THEY ARE. BUT THESE WOMEN, AS THEY TELL ME IN THE DIASPORA HERE AS WELL IN THE UNITED STATES AND ACROSS THE WORLD, REALLY, THEY ARE HELPING PUSH EXACTLY WHAT THESE PROTESTERS WANT ON THE GROUND THERE, SUPPORTING THEM, KEEPING THEIR VOICES ALIVE AS THEY ARE CONTINUING TO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE EVERY SINGLE DAY IN IRAN. AND A WOMAN-LED REVOLUTION, SOMETHING WE HAVE NEVER SEEN IN THIS WORLD.  DEMOCRACY RELIES ON WOMEN AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING AROUND THE WORLD. IT'S SO EXTRAORDINARY, IN UKRAINE AS WELL. WE TALKED ABOUT IT ALL YEAR, MIKA, THE WAY IN WHICH WOMEN HOLD THE KEYS TO DEMOCRACY FOR EVERYONE IN THEIR SOCIETIES, AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS SO POWERFUL AND MEN HAVE GALVANIZED AS WELL BECAUSE THEY KNOW WITHOUT WOMEN'S RIGHTS, NONE OF OUR RIGHTS ARE SAFE.  ERIN HAINES, YASMIN VOSSOUGHIAN, LAUREN LEADER, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BEFORE WE WRAP THINGS UP, A BIG HEAD TO NEWS IN 2023. KNOW YOUR VALUE AND FORBES ARE HOSTING THE SECOND ANNUAL 30/50 INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY SUMMIT IN ABU DHABI FROM MARCH 7th TO 10th.

        "trs": " I BELIEVE WE NEED JUDGES WHO UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCE AND THE PEOPLE WHERE THEY COME FROM. THERE WILL BE LAWYERS AND JUDGES WHO WILL BE IN CHARGE, WHO UNDERSTAND, UNDERSTAND REAL PEOPLE AND THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE.  PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN DELIVERING ON THAT PROMISE BY REDEFINING THE COURTS AT A HISTORIC PACE. 97 LIFETIME FEDERAL JUDGES HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED UNDER PRESIDENT BIDEN, MORE THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENT AT THIS POINT IN THE PRESIDENCY. THE DEMOCRATS WHEN HE DEMOCRAT CONTROL OF THE SENATE, BIDEN'S JUDICIAL NOMINEES SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE VOTED ON SWIFTLY. BUT IT'S NOT JUST A HISTORIC PACE. THE DIVERSITY OF THOSE JUDGES. 97 JUDGES INCLUDING SUPREME COURT JUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO BECOME A MEMBER OF THE COURT, AS WELL AS 28TH CIRCUIT COURT JUDGES, 68 DISTRICT COURT JUDGES, THREE OUT OF EVERY FOUR BIDEN APPOINTED JUDGES A WOMEN. TWO THIRDS ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR. PRESIDENT BIDEN APPOINTED 11 LIKE LINDA 11 FORMER PUBLIC DEFENDERS TO FEDERAL APPEALS COURT. MORE THAN ALL PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS COMBINED. THAT MEANS THERE ARE MORE FEDERAL JUDGES REPRESENTING DEFENDANTS WITH THE LEAST POWERFUL, LEAST RESOURCES THE JUSTICE SYSTEM, FEDERAL BENCHES. I DON'T COURSE, IS THE SECONDARY BENEFIT INCREASING PULL OF EXPERIENCE, DIVERSE CANDIDATES FOR FUTURE SUPREME COURT SHORTLIST'S IS SOME CORN FOR IT. IN A YEAR THAT WILL BE DEFINED BY ANY RADICAL CONSERVATIVES ON THE CURRENT COURT, STRIPPING AWAY THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AN ABORTION. A MOVE WHICH IS OUTLAWED ABORTION IN MORE THAN A DOZEN STATES, MOST OF THEM STATES GOVERNED BY RADICAL REPUBLICANS. REPUBLICANS IN SOME STATES ARE NOT ONLY TARGETING ACCESS TO ABORTION, BUT WAYS TO PUNISH PEOPLE FOR PROVIDING INFORMATION ON THE PROCEDURE. AN ESSAY IN THE NEW YORK TIMES OUR NEXT GUEST, PROFESSOR MICHELLE GOODWIN WRITES, QUOTE, THERE ARE ALREADY TWO AMERICAS WHEN IT COMES TO THE RIGHT TO ABORTION. IF THOSE IN THE PROCEDURE GET THEIR WAY, THE SAME WILL BE TRUE AND THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE THE FIRST AMENDMENT. JOINING US NOW IS NEIL HAWLEY DE, AND PROFESSOR AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW, ALSO WITH US MICHELLE GOODWIN, CHANCELLOR PROFESSOR OF LARGE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE. SHE'S THE AUTHOR OF POLICING THE WOMB. INVISIBLE WOMEN AND THE CRIMINALIZATION OF MOTHERHOOD. GREAT TO SEE YOU BOTH. PROFESSOR HOLLY, I WANT TO START WITH YOU. THE PRESIDENTS RECORD, THIS PACE OF FEDERAL JUDGES, PUT IT INTO CONTEXT FOR US. WHY IS IT SUCH A BIG DEAL?  I THINK IT'S AN INCREDIBLY BIG DEAL, BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE FEDERAL COURTS ARE SOMETHING THAT SURVIVE A PRESIDENTS TERM. THE FEDERAL COURTS CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE, AS YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT IN DOBBS. SO FOR EXAMPLE, PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS APPOINTED, AS YOU NOTED, 11 BLACK WOMEN TO THE FEDERAL APPELLATE COURTS. IN 230 PLUS YEARS OF FEDERAL COURTS WE ONLY HAD A BLACK WOMAN TO EVER SERVE ON THE APPELLATE COURT. SO IT'S REALLY A HISTORIC RECORD OF CONFIRMATIONS AND NOMINATIONS THAT THE BIDEN PRESIDENCY HAS PUT FORTH.  IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF SAID, QUOTE, HAVING A MORE DIVERSE DIVERSE FEDERAL BENCH IN EVERY SINGLE RESPECT WAS MORE RESPECT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PROFESSOR GOODWIN, THERE IS THE GENDER PIECE OF THIS, THERE IS THE RACE AND ETHNICITY PIECE OF THIS, AND THERE'S ALSO THE CAREER DIVERSITY, THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE MORE PUBLIC DEFENDERS IN THE MIX. THAT CHANGES THE COURTS THEMSELVES.  IT ABSOLUTELY DOES. AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US BOTH ON WITH YOU, ALICIA. THE UNITED STATES INCARCERATE MORE PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, MORE MAN AND IN FACT MORE WOMEN THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HAD A FEDERAL BENCH AND ALSO A SUPREME COURT THAT FAILS TO REPRESENT THE WHOLENESS OF WHAT AMERICA IS ALL ABOUT, INCLUDING THE REPRESENTATION OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CRIMINALLY CHARGED, IS ITSELF SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN AT FAULT IN HOW PEOPLE HAVE BEEN NOMINATED TO OUR COURTS, NOT JUST THE SUPREME COURT BUT ALSO THE LOWER FEDERAL COURTS. THIS IS A BIG CORRECTIVE, AND IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT WE HAVE A CONSTITUTION WHERE THE FIRST TEN AMENDMENTS, MANY OF THEM ARE ABOUT PROTECTING PEOPLE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS, AND YET WE HAVE NOT HAD THE FEDERAL BENCH REPRESENT THAT.  STAY WITH, YOU PROFESSOR GOODWIN, BECAUSE I DO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE ARTICLE THAT YOU WROTE. WE'VE TALKED EXTENSIVELY, YOU AND I, ABOUT THE FALLOUT FROM JOBS. I WONDER WHAT YOU ARE WATCHING FOR NEXT, PARTICULARLY IN STATES WHERE ABORTION IS NOW OUTLAWED.  WELL, IT'S WORTH NOTING WITH AN ARTICLE THAT I WROTE A FEW YEARS AGO WITH ONE OF MY FORMER STUDENTS WHO IS NOW ON TRACK TO BECOMING A PROFESSOR HERSELF, MARIAH LINDSEY, AND WE WROTE ABOUT THE REPRESENTATION OF WOMEN ON THE BENCH AND WHAT THAT MEANS. AND SO WE WERE THINKING ABOUT, THIS CRITICAL MASS MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE. THAT IS WHAT WE SEE WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND THE VOLUME OF WOMEN THAT ARE BEING NOMINATION TO THE COURT. IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST DO WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED TOKENISM, ONE WOMAN HERE OR THERE, BUT YOU REALLY NEED A MASS MOVEMENT IN ORDER TO MAKE BETTER WAYS OF THINKING, METHODOLOGY, CLARITY, COME TO LIFE. WHAT WE FOUND IN A STUDY THAT WE DID IS THAT EVEN REPUBLICAN APPOINTED WHEN INTO THE FEDERAL BENCH ARE INCLINED TO SUPPORT REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT THE SUPREME COURT WITH RUTH BADER GINSBURG ORDERED JUSTICE O'CONNOR, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT FEDERAL COURTS, PRIOR TO DONALD TRUMP, CONSISTENTLY REPUBLICAN APPOINTED FEDERAL JUDGES THAT ARE WOMEN SUPPORT FOR REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. SO I THINK THE IMPACT IS CLEAR, WHETHER DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN APPOINTED.  PROFESSOR, I'M INTERESTED BY WHAT WE ARE WATCHING RIGHT NOW, SORT OF UNDER THIS PRESIDENCY. I ALSO WONDER IF SOMETHING HAS SHIFTED FOR DEMOCRATS, IF THIS IMPORTANCE OF THE COURT NOW LOOMS LARGER, NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF JOBS BUT BECAUSE OF HOW IMPORTANT THE COURTS WERE FOR ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE TRUMP ERA. HAS THIS CREATED A SEISMIC AND PERMANENT SHIFT?  I DON'T THINK WE'RE QUITE THERE YET. I THINK ONE OF THE MAJOR MISSING PIECES TO THIS IS THE FEDERAL TRIAL COURTS, SO WE LOOK AT THE FEDERAL TRIAL COURTS IN THE DISTRICT COURTS AND THERE ARE A HUGE NUMBER OF VACANCIES, ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH, IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT COURTS. SO TAKE A JUDGE LIKE MICHELLE CHILDS, ON THE DISTRICT COURT FOR SOUTH CAROLINA, SHE'S NOW IN THE APPELLATE COURT IN D.C.. HER SPACE IS VACANT. SO THERE ARE TWO REPUBLICAN SENATORS IN SOUTH CAROLINA, AND THROUGH THE BLUE SLIP PROCESS, THEY CAN HOLD UP NOMINATIONS FOR A DISTRICT COURT. AND WE ARE SEEING AN EXTENSIVE NUMBER OF VACANCIES. SO I THINK BEFORE WE BEGIN TO SAY THAT THERE'S BEEN WHOLESALE CHANGE IN A SEISMIC SHIFT, WE NEED TO SEE THE PACE OF CONFIRMATIONS OR NOMINATIONS THROUGH THE DISTRICT COURTS, WHICH MAKE THE HUGE JUST, HUGE EXCEPTION FOR MANY CASES HAPPEN OR DECIDED IN THE DISTRICT COURT LEVEL. UNTIL WE SEE THAT PACE OF NOMINATIONS REALLY PICK UP IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT COURTS, I DON'T THINK WE CAN DECLARE IT A SEISMIC SHIFT YET. BUT THAT'S THE DIRECTION IT'S MOVING IN.  TALK TO ME ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS HAS STARTED TO BECOME ABOUT THE FIRST AMENDMENT. UNDERSTANDING THE ROOTS OF THAT CONVERSATION HAD BEEN THERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME.  THAT'S RIGHT. ONE OF THE MATTERS CONCERNING PREDAWN OBSCENE AND NOW CERTAINLY A GLARING PROBLEM POST-DOBBS IS THE LANGUAGE, THE FIRST AMENDMENT, PARTICULARLY RELIGIOUS PROTECTIONS HAS BEEN USED AND WEAPONIZED BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT. AND SENDING SIGNALS TO STATE LEGISLATURES. THAT IS TO SAY THAT NOW WE MUST BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH THE PROTECTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS WILL IMPACT PEOPLES ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION, OR AT LEAST THE CLAIMS, THE CLAIM THAT ONE HAS A RELIGIOUS OBJECTION TO PROVIDING AND DISPENSING CONTRACEPTION, THE WAYS IN WHICH THE FIRST AMENDMENT HAS BEEN USED AS A SWORD TO TELL LIBRARIANS THAT THEY MAY NOT TALK ABOUT ABORTION, THAT THEY MAY NOT HELP PEOPLE SEARCH THE TERM ABORTION, THE WAY IN WHICH THERE BECOMES A KIND OF WEAPONIZATION AND USING THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF THOSE WHO ARE ANTI-REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM TO THE HARM OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PRO-CHOICE, WHO WOULD SAY THAT THEY HAVE A FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT AS WELL. AND SO THE NEW YORK TIMES PIECE GOES THROUGH THE MYRIAD WAYS IN WHICH WE SHOULD BE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION SHOWING UPSIDE DOWN INCLUDING THE FIRST AMENDMENT, PROTECTIONS BEING LIMITED FOR THOSE WHO WOULD SEEK TO PROTECT REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM AND WEAPONIZE FOR THOSE WHO ARE ANTIABORTION.  IT LANDS ON THE VERY SCARY POSSIBILITY OF LAW GOING INTO AN AMERICA WHERE THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS TREATED DIFFERENTLY IN THIS REGARD. MICHELLE GOODWIN, DANIELLE HOLLEY, THANKS AS ALWAYS. IF YOU FOLLOW POLITICS AS WE ARE, YOU'VE HEARD REPORTING ABOUT EAGER TO SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, IGNORANCE ABOUT WHO WON THE 2020 ELECTION, THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. BUT THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE. MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE A HUGE RANGE OF ISSUES TO KNOW ABOUT. NATIONAL SECURITY, THE ECONOMY, MEDICARE, MEDICAID, UKRAINE, ENVIRONMENTAL LAW, ALL ASPECTS OF AMERICAN LIFE AND GOVERNANCE. WE TURN TO EXPERTS TO GUIDE THEIR UNDERSTANDING. SOME ISSUES ARE SO NEW AND INVOLVING SO FAST YOU JUST HAVE TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE. SO THAT'S WHAT MOM LAWMAKER ON THE OFFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CAUCUS IS DOING. WE WILL MEET HIM, NEXT. WE WILL MEET HIM, NEXT 20221230034610.566|20221230034852.012",

        "trs": "> TODAY'S HEARING IS BUT AN ATTEMPT TO BLAME REPUBLICANS FOR THE HORRENDOUS ACTS OF VIOLENCE.  THIS IS A BLAME REPUBLICANS SO WE DON'T HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR OWN DEFUND THE POLICE AND SOFT ON CRIME POLICIES.  I THINK ONE, IF WE LOOK AT THE TYPE OF PEOPLE COMMITTING THE CRIMES, THE BREAKDOWN OF THE FAMILY. AND, OF COURSE, WE HAVE PEOPLE HERE WHO STOOD WITH BLACK LIVES MATTER, WHO INITIALLY WAS OPPOSED TO THAT.  JUST TO BE CLEAR, THAT WAS A HEARING THIS MONTH ON THE TOPIC OF ANTILGBTQ VIOLENCE. AND YET, TRUE TO FORM, REPUBLICANS WERE EAGER TO PLAY THE VICTIM CARD AND THE CHANGE THE SUBJECT CARD AND THE ANYTHING BUT LET'S SOLVE THE PROBLEM CARD. BLAMING THE RISE IN CRIME ON DEFUND THE POLICE, MIGRANTS CROSSING THE BORDER AND THE BREAKDOWN OF THE FAMILY. WE'RE BACK WITH OUR PANEL. DONELL, WHAT IS THE -- YOU KNOW, AS A STUDENT OF SOME OF THESE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS, HOW DO YOU GET TO THE BEGINNING OF COMBATTING THIS LINE WHERE THE IDEOLOGY TRIGGERS VIOLENCE OR THE IDEOLOGY SEEPS INTO THE MIND OF SOMEONE WHO IS UNSTAPABLE AND CAPABLE OF VIOLENCE, WHICH SEEMS LIKE A VERY COMPLICATED, VERY INTRICATE AND VERY SORT OF ALL HANDS ON DECK MISSION. HOW DO YOU BEGIN TO TACKLE THAT, IF AGAIN, YOU HAVE THIS REFUSAL TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND SAY AS A COUNTRY WE HAVE A PROBLEM WITH EXTREMISM AND ITS CAPACITY TO SPILL INTO VIOLENCE?  THE FIRST THING WE DO IN INTELLIGENCE IN HOMELAND SECURITY WE LOOK AT THE THREAT ENVIRONMENT. I POINT YOU TO POVERTY LAW CENTER REPORT THAT INDICATES THAT FROM 2008 TO LAST YEAR, ANTI-GOVERNMENT GROUPS INCREASED BY 300%. AND SO, WHEREAS WE HAD IN 2008 ABOUT 150 NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT ABOUT 500. THE THREAT ENVIRONMENT IS RICH RIGHT NOW FOR THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY, VIOLENT EXTREMISM. IT COMES FROM, OBVIOUSLY, POLITICIANS, IT COMES FROM CONSERVATIVE MEDIA. BUT IT ALSO COMES FROM THE INTERNET. IT COMES FROM THE DARK AND DEEP WEB. SITES WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. THE LACK OF CONTENT MODERATION. AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS, AND I HATE TO SAY THIS, HATE SELLS IN THIS COUNTRY. AND MANY SEE THE VISION OF AMERICA AS AN ENTERPRISE THAT CAN GAIN THEM EITHER VOTES OR CLICKS OR CASH. AND WE DON'T HAVE TO LOOK THAT FAR PAST SOMEONE LIKE NICK FUENTES OR SOMEONE IN THIS THREAT ENVIRONMENT THAT ARE STOKING THIS TYPE OF HATE. WE HAVE IGNORED A DOMESTIC VIOLENT AND DOMESTIC EXTREMISM PROBLEM FOR MANY YEARS AND IT'S COMING BACK TO BITE US BECAUSE THEY'RE ENABLED BY TECHNOLOGY, PARTICULARLY THE SOCIAL MEDIA ASPECT BUT ALSO YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE SO CALLED INFLUENCERS WHO ARE STOKING THIS. THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS THAT THE PART THAT I FIND INTERESTING ONCE AGAIN AS A STUDENT AND A PROFESSOR OF HOMELAND SECURITY IS THIS CONSTANT FRICTION BETWEEN SECURITY AND SAFETY. AND PRIVACY, CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES. THERE'S NEVER ANY EQUILIBRIUM. THERE'S A VERY LIMITED TIME BETWEEN THE TIME THEY DECIDE TO GO OPERATIONAL AND THEY BECOME VIOLENT TO INTRADIGIT THEM. THEY ALSO HIDE BEHIND THE SECOND AMENDMENT AND THESE GROUPS FOR DECADES HAVE AMASSED WEAPONS AND TACTICS, TECHNIQUES AND PROCEDURES THAT MAKE THEM VERY, VERY LETHAL NOW.  YEAH. FIRST AMENDMENT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT, THE SECOND AMENDMENT WHILE THEY'RE PLANNING IT AND THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY THEY DON'T SEE IN REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS WHEN THEY'RE OPERATIONAL. IT'S AMAZING. PETE, I WANT TO READ YOU REVELATIONS TO THE JANUARY 6th REPORT THAT WE HAVEN'T GOT TO YET. MITCH McCONNELL OF ALL PEOPLE WAS ON THE PHONE WITH DONALD TRUMP'S NATIONAL SECURITY ADD ADVISER WARNING THAT EXMILITARY WAS A THREAT TO JOE BIDEN. TWO DAYS AFTER PRO-DONALD TRUMP RIOTERS ATTACKED THE CAPITOL, THEN NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER ROBERT O'BRIEN GOT A CALL FROM MITCH McCONNELL AND AN AIDE WHO ASKED HIM TO LOOK INTO SOMETHING HE'D BE HEARING. RETIRED MILITARY PERSONNEL SYMPATHETIC TO PRESIDENT TRUMP MIGHT BE TRYING TO STOP JOE BIDEN. THERE WERE REPORTS OF EX-MILITARY SYMPATHETIC TO THE PRESIDENT. THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT NAVY SEALS. THAT'S FROM POLITICO ABOUT THE O'BRIEN TRANSCRIPTS BEING PART OF THE FINAL REPORT. I KNOW THE RIGHT WENT NUTS WHEN THE NEW DEFENSE SECRETARY AND PENTAGON LEADERS SOUGHT TO EXAMINE EXTREMISM IN THE MILITARY. AND I WONDER, PETE, WHAT YOU MAKE OF OUR ABILITY TO AT LEAST SHINE A LIGHT ON IT AS A FIRST STEP TO COMBATTING IT.  NICOLE, THAT EPISODE WITH McCONNELL IS ABSOLUTELY CHILLING. I THINK IT IS AN AREA THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT RADICALIZATION WITHIN THE MILITARY RANKS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LAST NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT PASSED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, THERE WERE SEVERAL MEASURES MAYBE SIX OR SEVEN, THAT HAD FUNDING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO DO STUDIES AND LOOK AT THE PHENOMENON OF RADICALIZATION WITHIN THE OFFICER CORP. AND ENLISTED CORP. TO SEE HOW BIG THE PROBLEM IS. BUT BECAUSE IT'S A POLITICAL ISSUE ALL OF THOSE MEASURES WAS STRIPPED OUT OF IT ZEROED OUT THE FUNDING PROPOSED FOR EVEN JUST TAKING A LOOK AT THE PROBLEM TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS AN ISSUE, HOW BROAD AN ISSUE IT WAS, AND WHAT MIGHT BE DONE. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE MONEY TO TAKE A FIRST LOOK AT THAT. THE ISSUE AT THE END OF THE DAY, I AGREE THERE'S A PROFIT MOTIVE BUT ALSO A POLITICAL MOTIVE. WE HAD MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE AND MARK MEADOWS TALKING ABOUT THE QANON SAYING THESE ARE MY PEOPLE.  MY PEOPLE.  THERE ARE PEOPLE IN CONGRESS WHO HAVE AS THEIR CONSTITUENTS WHO PUT THEM INTO POWER, QANON AND THESE OTHER EXTRAORDINARILY DANGEROUS GROUPS WHO HAVE VIOLENT IDEOLOGIES AT THE FRINGES. SO IT'S NOT JUST A PROFIT ISSUE. IT'S A POLITICAL POWER ISSUE AS WELL. BEFORE WE DO ANY WORK TO LOOK AT THIS, YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF POLITICAL WILL TO DO IT AND I JUST DON'T SEE THAT COMING OUT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AT LEAST NOT FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS.  A.B. IT SEEMS LIKE VOTERS INTUITED SOME OF THIS, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DEMOCRATS TO BE BLUNT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOT ALL REPUBLICANS ARE DOMESTIC EXTREMISTS, PRONE TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM. BUT ALL THE DOMESTIC EXTREMISTS POSED TO DOMESTIC TERRORISM ARE REPUBLICANS SAYS CHRIS WRAY.  RIGHT. I SEE THE AVERAGE HOUSE MEMBER TRYING TO MAKE THAT CASE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS NOT GOING TO BREAK THROUGH THE WAY THAT MERRICK GARLAND AND CHRIS WRAY AND JOE BIDEN ARE GOING TO. AND THEY ARE REALLY BOXED IN, BECAUSE REPUBLICANS ARE EXACTING THIS LEVERAGE THAT'S BEING DESCRIBED HERE ON OUR -- ON OUR -- ON THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, ON THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE FBI. IF YOU HAVE A SYSTEM TO TRACK THREATS, TO SCHOOL OFFICIALS AND SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS AND SCHOOL NURSES, YOU ARE, QUOTE, TARGETING AND CENSORING REPUBLICAN VOTERS. IF YOU PROSECUTE PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO OVERTHROW THE ELECTION AND WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEATHS OF SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE INSURRECTION AT THE CAPITOL, THEY ARE POLITICAL PRISONERS. EVERYONE IS A MARTYR AS DESCRIBED BY THE REPUBLICANS. AND ALL OF THE USE OF OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM TO BRING THEM TO JUSTICE IS -- IS AN ABUSE AND REPUBLICANS ARE NOT GOING TO GO AFTER THE THREAT OF DOMESTIC EXTREMISM, WHICH IS A THREAT AROUND THE COUNTRY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THEY WILL NEVER, AS PETE JUST POINTED OUT, TOUCH THE INTERNAL THREAT, THE RADICALIZATION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MILITARY FROM WITHIN. WE HAVE ONE PARTY ABDICATING THEIR OATH TO THE CONSTITUTION AND DUTY TO KEEP AMERICANS SAFE AND TO HAVE AN EFFECTIVE AND TRUSTWORTHY AND CREDIBLE GOVERNMENT. AND THE POLITICAL POWER OF THEIR NARRATIVE IS SO ENERGIZING TO THEIR QUASI-VIOLENT BASE IS EXTREMELY TROUBLING AND I THINK THEY HAVE A VERY STRONG UPPER HAND.  BARBARA, AS EVERYONE IS TALKING I'M THINKING ABOUT CASSIDY HUTCHINSON'S TESTIMONY ABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP SAID, ABOUT HIS ARMED SUPPORTERS ON JANUARY 6th. WHEN HE SAID TAKE DOWN THE MAGS AND LET THEM IN, THEY WON'T HURT ME. DO YOU THINK THE WHY IS THAT REPUBLICANS THINK THEY DON'T REPRESENT A THREAT TO THEM? I STILL STRUGGLE WITH THE WHY.  I THINK THEY SEE POLITICAL ADVANTAGE IN PROTECTING THAT GROUP, AND ADVANCING THAT NARRATIVE. I THINK THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN EXPLOITING DIFFERENCES IN THIS COUNTRY. THEY WERE ALREADY THERE, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONSERVATIVES AND PROGRESSIVES, BUT DONALD TRUMP HAS DONE ALL HE CAN TO STOKE THOSE DIVISIONS AND PUSH PEOPLE TO MORE EXTREME VERSIONS OF THEMSELVES. AND TO PUT THEM AT WAR WITH EACH OTHER. WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE, I'M SURE YOU THOUGHT THIS AS WELL, NICOLE, YOU COULD HAVE DIFFERENT VIEWS ON THINGS LIKE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION AND GUN CONTROL. YOU MIGHT BE IN FAVOR OF ONE, OPPOSED TO ANOTHER. BUT NOW IT IS ALL OR NOTHING. YOU ARE FOR US OR AGAINST US. AND POLITICAL RIVALS ARE NOT JUST POLITICAL OPPONENTS THEY ARE DEMONIZED, THEY ARE THE ENEMY. THIS IS ONE MEMBER AT A TRUMP RALLY WHO SAID IT'S TEAM TRUMP VERSUS TEAM LUCIFER AND IT'S NOT DIFFICULT TO DECIDE. WHEN THERE'S THAT STOKING AND THE DEMONIZATION OF THE OTHER, PEOPLE ARE TURNED AGAINST THEIR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS. IT REMINDS ME, NICOLE OF THE WORK WE DID IN THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AGAINST EXTREMISM AND VIOLENCE BUT IT WAS FOCUSED AGAINST AL QAEDA AND NOBODY HAD A PROBLEM WITH IT. NOW IT'S THE OATH KEEPERS AND THE PROUD BOYS AND EVERYONE IS ABANDONING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PEOPLE.  THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR STARTING US OFF. BARBARA McQUAD STICKS AROUND. AFTER THE BREAK FOR US, THE LIES KEEP PILING UP, A NEW ONE TODAY FROM CONGRESSMAN-ELECT GEORGE SANTOS, REPUBLICAN FROM NEW YORK. NOW REPORTEDLY THE SUBJECT OF A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION. WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT THAT NEXT. T 20221229213901.538|20221229214207.290",

        "trs": "> IT'S JUST COMPLETELY CLEAR THAT HE HAD CULPABLE CRIMINAL INTENT. HE KNEW HE HAD LOST THE ELECTION. HE KNEW THE CROWD WAS ARMED AND DANGEROUS. HE SAID, TAKE DOWN THE MAGS. THESE WERE HIS PEOPLE. THEY WEREN'T GOING TO HURT HIM. HE UNLEASHED THE CROWD TO GO AND FIGHT LIKE HELL, AND THEN SAID WHEN FRAUD IS INVOLVED, THERE ARE VERY DIFFERENT RULES THAT ARE ALLOWED AND SO ON. I MEAN, IT'S JUST -- IT'S JUST AN OPEN AND SHUT CASE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE.  HI AGAIN, EVERYONE. IT'S 5:00 IN THE EAST. AN OPEN AND SHUT CASE AGAINST THE EX-PRESIDENT, SAYS JANUARY 6th SELECT COMMITTEE MEMBER, JAMIE RASKIN, COMING TO THAT ON COLLUSION ONLY AFTER 18 MONTHS IN A DEEP AND THOROUGH INVESTIGATION THAT IS WRAPPING UP IN THE COMING DAYS. THE COMMITTEE IS SET TO OFFICIALLY DISSOLVE WHEN THE CONGRESSIONAL SESSION EXPIRES, WHEN REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. THE CASE OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S CONDUCT IS NOW IN THE HANDS OF FEDERAL PROSECUTORS AT THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, WHO WILL MAKE THE HISTORIC DECISION WHETHER TO CRIMINALLY CHARGE AN EX-PRESIDENT. IN ITS FINAL DAYS AND WEEKS, THE SELECT COMMITTEE HAS SENT DOJ ITS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION ON DONALD TRUMP. IT IS MAKING PUBLIC THOUSANDS OF CASES OF TRANSCRIPTS OF INTERVIEWS OF KEY WITNESSES. INSIDE THOSE PAGES, REVELATIONS LIKE THIS, HOW LABOR SECRETARY EUGENE SCALIA PUSHED TO CONVENE A CABINET MEETING AFTER JANUARY 6th TO DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT TO AN ORDERLY TRANSITION, ONLY TO BE STRONGLY REBUFFED BY THE EX-PRESIDENT, AS SCALIA FEARED TRUMP WAS CONTINUING TO GET BAD ADVICE FROM SOURCES OUTSIDE THE ADMINISTRATION. EARLIER TODAY, THE LATEST BATCH OF TRANSCRIPTS WERE RELEASED, NEARLY 20 OF THEM. AMONG THE TRANSCRIPTS WAS THE COMMITTEE'S INTERVIEW WITH RAY EPPS. EPPS IS A CAPITOL RIOTER WHO BECAME THE TARGET OF A RIGHT WING CONSPIRACY SPREAD BY SOME, INCLUDING SOME SITTING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, THAT HE WAS SECRETLY WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT. QUOTE, THE ONLY TIME I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE GOVERNMENT WAS WHEN I WAS A MARINE IN THE U.S. MARINE CORP. THE SELECT COMMITTEE WITHDREW ITS SUBPOENA OF THE EX-PRESIDENT YESTERDAY, CITING THE COMMITTEE'S IMMINENT END. POLITICO REPORTS ON A FEDERAL JUDGE CITING THE COMMITTEE'S REFERRAL IN HIS OPINION, QUOTE, U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE JOHN BEATS, AN APPOINTEE OF PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH, RULED ALEXANDER SHEPARD SHOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM MAKING THE PUBLIC AUTHORITY DEFENSE BECAUSE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TRUMP TOLD HIS FOLLOWERS THAT ENTERING THE RESTRICTED GROUNDS ON JANUARY 6th WAS LEGAL. IN FACT, HIS INCENDIARY RHETORIC, ESPECIALLY TELLING HIS SUPPORTERS TO, QUOTE, FIGHT LIKE HELL, MAY SUGGEST TRUMP WAS ASKING THEM TO BREAK THE LAW. THE SELECT COMMITTEE'S FINDING THAT TRUMP VIOLATED AT LEAST FOUR FEDERAL LAWS IN HIS CRUSADE TO SUBVERT THE 2020 ELECTION. AND IT IS AN EARLY WINDOW INTO HOW THE JUDICIARY MIGHT INTERPRET THE UNUSUAL FINDINGS OF CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS BY A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE. AND IT IS WHERE WE BEGIN THE HOUR. JOINING US, CONGRESSWOMAN ZOE LOFGREN OF CALIFORNIA, A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE, A FREQUENT GUEST. TO HAVE ALL OF THIS OUT AND TO NOT HAVE TO CRY IN PLACES YOU DON'T WANT TO GET AHEAD OF THE REST OF YOUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS IS A PRIVILEGE. SO, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I REMEMBER ASKING YOU I THINK ALMOST A YEAR AGO -- IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THAT LONG. BUT MONTHS AGO ABOUT THE DECISION TO TAKE THE DEPOSITIONS, WHICH WAS SO EARTH-SHATTERINGLY DRAMATIC AND IMPACTFUL IN THE PUBLIC HEARINGS. YOU SORT OF VERY, WELL, WE THOUGHT -- THAT WAS YOU. THAT WAS YOU. THAT WAS YOUR --  YES, IT WAS.  -- YOUR SORT OF RECOMMENDATION. WHAT CAN YOU SAY ABOUT THAT AND THE IMPACT THAT IT ULTIMATELY HAD?  WELL, WE HAD A BUNCH OF FORMER U.S. ATTORNEYS DOING VERY CAPABLE QUESTIONING OF WITNESSES. ORDINARILY THE U.S. ATTORNEYS DON'T VIDEO TAPE THE WITNESSES IN THEIR PROCEEDINGS, BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT. AND WHEN I FOUND OUT THEY WEREN'T BEING VIDEO TAPED, I SAID, GOSH, WE'VE GOT TO DO THIS. AND I WAS TOLD, WELL, WE DON'T HAVE THE EQUIPMENT. YOU KNOW, YOU'VE GOT AN iPHONE. I MEAN, VIDEO THE INTERVIEWS. AND CLEARLY, WE WERE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE, LOOKING AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WE NEEDED TO INTERVIEW, TO HAVE THEM ALL APPEAR IN A PUBLIC HEARING SETTING. IT WAS JUST TOO VOLUMINOUS. AND IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE VIDEOS OF THESE INTERVIEWS BECAUSE THE TRANSCRIPTS ARE IMPORTANT. BUT SOMETIMES THE BODY LANGUAGE IS IMPORTANT AS WELL. AND OF COURSE THE FACT THAT WE HAD VIDEOS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO PUT TOGETHER, I THINK, COMPELLING HEARINGS WITH THEIR TESTIMONY. AND YOU COULD SEE THERE WERE A COUPLE OF TIMES PRIOR TO THE VIDEOTAPING, MR. DONAHUE AND ROSEN, WE JUST HAD PICTURES AND AUDIO. BUT I'M SO GLAD THAT WE ENACTED THE VIDEO POLICY SO THAT WE WOULD GET ALL OF THIS CAPTURED.  OBVIOUSLY IN TELEVISION, IT'S SO VALUABLE TO HAVE THE PICTURES OF THESE PEOPLE, NOT JUST IN THEIR OWN WORDS BUT IN THEIR OWN VOICES AND WATCHING THEM. I MEAN, SEEING BILL BARR CALL DONALD TRUMP'S DELUSIONS OF HAVING WON B.S. OVER AND OVER AGAIN ON CAMERA WAS PRICELESS. AND I WONDER -- THE STORY NOW IS MORE PUBLIC ABOUT HOW A VERY ACCOMPLISHED TELEVISION PRODUCER ENTERED INTO THE COMMITTEE'S LIFE. AND WHEN HE SAID, WHAT DO WE HAVE, SOME OF WHAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO WAS TO EDIT, TO SPLICE TOGETHER TRUMP INSIDER AFTER TRUMP INSIDER AFTER TRUMP INSIDER SAYING YES, HE KNEW HE LOST. HOW DO YOU KNOW? BECAUSE I TOLD HIM. WHAT DO YOU THINK -- AS YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE COMMITTEE ENDED, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT SEEMED LIKE IT WASN'T PREDETERMINED AT ANY POINT -- YOU'LL TELL ME -- BEFORE CRIMINAL REFERS FOR THE EX-PRESIDENT. WHAT WAS THE IMPACT OF BEING ABLE TO SHARE WITH THE WHOLE COUNTRY WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S CLOSEST ADVISERS THOUGHT HE HAD DONE?  WELL, I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT. I THINK YOU ASKED ME EARLY ON WHAT WOULD BE A SUCCESS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND I THINK I SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT REENERGIZING THE PASSION OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR THEIR DEMOCRACY WOULD BE PART OF THE SUCCESS. AND I THINK OUR HEARINGS HELPED TO DO THAT. PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE OF THE TESTIMONY THAT THERE HAD BEEN A THREAT TO OUR DEMOCRACY AND IT WAS COMING FROM REPUBLICAN INSIDERS WHO WERE THE WITNESSES. IT WASN'T DEMOCRATS. IT WAS REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF THE TRUMP WORLD THAT WERE TELLING US WHAT THEY HAD SEEN AND WHAT THEY HAD DONE. AND I THINK IT WAS VERY COMPELLING. AND IT HAD AN INFLUENCE ON PEOPLE, UNDERSTANDING, YOU KNOW, RIGHT OR LEFT ON THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM, WE BETTER CHERISH AND PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY.  WHEN LIZ CHENEY FIRST STARTED READING FROM THE CRIMINAL CODE, I THINK I FIRST STARTED PEPPERING YOU WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT WHERE THAT WAS HEADING. I THINK IT WAS MONTHS LATER THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTED THAT CRIMINAL REFERRALS WERE ON THE TABLE. UNTIL THE FINAL TIME WE GOT TO TALK TO YOU, THE COMMITTEE DIDN'T GET AHEAD OF ITS OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM THE SUBCOMMITTEE, WHICH YOU WERE A PART OF WITH THREE OF YOUR OTHER COLLEAGUES. BUT CAN YOU TAKE US NOW INSIDE THE DECISION TO MAKE THOSE FOUR CRIMINAL REFERRALS?  SURE. IT WAS IMPORTANT TO US THAT WE NOT RECOMMEND ANYTHING THAT WASN'T TETHERED TO THE FACTS THAT WE HAD UNCOVERED. AND SO WE WENT THROUGH AND THE STAFF WAS VERY HELPFUL. AS I SAY, A LOT OF FORMER U.S. ATTORNEYS ON THE STAFF ASSEMBLING. THE FACTS THAT WE HAD UNCOVERED AND THEN COMPARING THOSE FACTS TO THE CRIMINAL STATUTES. AND IT WAS A LENGTHY PROCESS, BUT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT WE ACT CAREFULLY AND THAT WE GOT GET AHEAD OF WHERE THE FACTS WERE THAT WE HAD UNCOVERED. SO, IN THE END, THE SUBCOMMITTEE WAS -- BENNIE THOMPSON SAID, WELL, ALL THE LAWYERS ON THE COMMITTEE WILL BE THE SUBCOMMITTEE. AND THEN WE PRESENTED IT AND WENT THROUGH IT WITH THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AS I THINK I'VE MENTIONED, I DON'T THINK -- OTHER THAN THE VOTES WE HAD IN PUBLIC, WE NEVER HAD OFFICIAL VOTES. WE JUST TALKED THROUGH ISSUES AND REACHED CONSENSUS. AND THAT'S WHAT WE DID IN THIS CASE AS WELL.  I ASKED CONGRESSMAN RASKIN WHAT THE RASKIN STANDARD WAS FOR CRIMINAL REFERRAL. AND HE SAID BASICALLY WHAT YOU JUST SAID, WHICH IS CLEAR IN THE RESULT BUT THE UNANIMOUS DECISIONS AROUND THESE, BUT THAT YOU WOULDN'T REFERRAL THE EX-PRESIDENT FOR ANY CRIMES THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK YOU HAD THE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT. AND I THINK SOME OF THE DRAMA WAS AROUND THE INCLUSION OF INSURRECTION. CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THAT BECAME ONE OF THE FOUR CRIMES THAT WERE REFERRED?  WELL, WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT IT, YOU KNOW, IT'S A SERIOUS OFFENSE. SOME OF THE, LACK OF A BETTER WORD, THE FOOT SOLDIERS HAVE NOW BEEN FACED AND BEEN CONVICTED OF INSURRECTION. SO, WE DID WANT TO EXAMINE THE INSTIGATOR, WHO WAS THE FORMER PRESIDENT, EX-PRESIDENT, INSTIGATED THIS ENTIRE THING. AND WHAT WAS HIS CULPABILITY THERE? SO, WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT THAT NOT JUST THE PEOPLE WHO DID WHAT HE TOLD THEM TO DO BUT THE EX-PRESIDENT HIMSELF BE EXAMINED FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW. AND WE THINK WE FOUND AMPLE EVIDENCE, CERTAINLY FOR GIVING AID AND COMFORT. AND WE THINK POTENTIALLY INCITING AS WELL.  I WONDERED AND I WANTED TO ASK YOU TODAY, THE FIRST PUBLIC HEARING WAS OF THE CAPITOL POLICE OFFICERS. AND IT WILL BE SEARED IN MY MEMORY FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS OF HARRY DUNN AND MICHAEL FANONE AND THE OTHER OFFICERS. THEY'VE BECOME UNBELIEVABLE AND PROBABLY UNWILLING NARRATORS TO THIS HORRIFIC ATTACK AND WHAT THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO. BUT HARRY DUNN SAYS AT THAT FIRST PUBLIC HEARING, GO FIND THE MAN WHO SENT THE HIT MEN. HOW MUCH DID THEIR PRESENCE AND THEIR ROLE INFLUENCE -- HOW DID YOU CARRY THEIR PRESENCE AND THE TRAUMA THEY SUFFERED WITH YOU, AS YOU DID YOUR WORK AS A COMMITTEE?  WELL, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY WE WERE ASSIGNED THIS TASK BY THE CONGRESS, YOU KNOW, SO IT WASN'T JUST THE OFFICERS. BUT WE WERE MINDFUL OF THE TREMENDOUS TRAUMA THEY HAD BEEN THROUGH, THE SACRIFICE THEY MADE BASICALLY TO SAVE OUR LIVES. THE OFFICERS ATTENDED MOST OF THE HEARINGS. AND I HAD A CHANCE IN MOST OF THE HEARINGS TO TALK TO THEM AFTER THE HEARING WAS OVER, ONE OR MORE OF THEM, TO GET THEIR TAKE, TO SEE HOW THEY FELT ABOUT IT. I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO OFFICER HODGES BRIEFLY AND GA NELL AFTER THE LAST HEARING. AND I THINK THEY HAD A SENSE -- I THINK ONE OF THEM TOLD ME THAT, YOU KNOW, THE COMMITTEE HAS DONE ITS JOB. AND I FELT GRATIFIED THAT THEY HAD SAID THAT, THAT THEY FELT THAT WAY, THAT WE DISCHARGED OUR DUTY, OF COURSE. AND THEY SAY, NOW IT'S UP TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.  OFFICERS DUNN AND FANONE FOR VERY EXPLICIT IN FEELING THAT UNLESS DOJ HOLDS TRUMP ACCOUNTABLE, THEN DOJ WOULD NOT HAVE DONE WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAS DONE, ITS JOB. WHAT IS THE -- I MEAN, WHAT IS THE HOPE NOW IN TERMS OF WHAT DOJ DOES WITH THE EVIDENCE, PARTICULARLY AROUND THE FOUR CRIMES THAT THE COMMITTEE'S REFERRED?  WELL, THEY HAVE, YOU KNOW, THEIR JOB TO DO. THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH CAN'T INSTRUCT THEM. BUT THEY'VE GOT TO SORT THROUGH THE EVIDENCE AND SEE IF THEY BELIEVE THEY HAVE EVIDENCE SUFFICIENT TO CONVICT. AND THAT'S EVIDENCE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. IF THEY DON'T THINK THEY ARE ABLE TO CONVICT, THEN THEY WON'T MAKE A CHARGE. AND THAT'S THE STANDARD, WHETHER IT'S, YOU KNOW, A GARDEN VARIETY CRIME IN A TOWN OR WHETHER IT'S THE EX-PRESIDENT BRINGING US TO THE BRINK OF A COUP, YOU HAVE TO HAVE EVIDENCE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT TO CONVICT. AND THEY'LL HAVE TO SORT THROUGH THAT. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN MISCONDUCT. AS YOU KNOW, WE REFERRED SEVERAL OTHERS, BUT ALSO NOTED THAT WE DIDN'T MEAN TO EXCLUDE OTHERS BECAUSE WE HAD JUST MENTIONED THEIR NAMES. BUT YOU CAN SEE, AS YOU READ THROUGH THESE TRANSCRIPTS, THERE IS A WHOLE BUNCH OF PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR THAT I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL BE LOOKING AT AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, BRINGING CHARGES.  CASSIDY HUTCHINSON'S TESTIMONY WAS ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC MOMENTS OF THE PUBLIC HEARINGS. HER TRANSCRIPT IS ALMOST AS DRAMATIC. I MEAN, THERE IS EVIDENCE OF MULTIPLE CRIMES FROM MULTIPLE PEOPLE, LAWYERS TELLING HER TO JUST BE LOYAL, MESSAGES COMING IN FROM TRUMP AND MARK MEADOWS. ARE THOSE THE INDIVIDUALS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU SAY THERE ARE PEOPLE WHOSE CRIMES HAVE BEEN RAISED AND ELIMINATED FOR DOJ?  AMONG THEM. I MEAN, HONESTLY, I WASN'T ABLE TO ATTEND THE FIRST SEPTEMBER TESTIMONY INTERVIEW THAT SHE HAD. BUT I READ THE TRANSCRIPT THE NEXT DAY. AND I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS JAW DROPPING WHAT SHE REVEALED. REALLY, IT READ LIKE A MOB FAMILY. I MEAN, IT'S REALLY SHOCKING STUFF. AND I STARTED THINKING BACK TO THE PRIOR INTERVIEWS THAT SHE HAD WITH THE COMMITTEE AND THE INTERVENTIONS HER THEN-LAWYER WAS MAKING THAT PRETTY MUCH MASKED THE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT SHE WAS TELLING US IN SEPTEMBER. SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOW IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HANDS OR THE VARIOUS BAR ASSOCIATIONS. BUT, YOU KNOW, APPARENTLY, AT LEAST THE TESTIMONY SHE GAVE, WHAT SHE WAS TOLD, WAS THAT SOMEONE -- AND IT APPEARED TO BE THE EX-PRESIDENT -- WAS READING THE TRANSCRIPTS AND THE INFORMATION WAS BEING SHARED. AND SHE WAS, YOU KNOW, CARROT/STICK. SHE FELT THREATENED. SHE WAS ALSO PROMISED A REALLY GOOD-PAYING JOB WHERE SHE'D BE VERY COMFORTABLE IF SHE JUST DID WHAT SHE WAS TOLD. REALLY SHOCKING STUFF.  BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, HIS TRANSCRIPT IS SHOCKING IN THE SAME WAY. DID YOU FEEL THREATENED? YES, I FELT THREATENED. AND IT'S A FEDERAL CRIME TO THREATEN AN ELECTION OFFICIAL. WILL YOU FEEL THE WAY OFFICERS FANONE AND DUNN HAVE SAID THEY WILL FEEL IF CHARGES ARE NOT BROUGHT AND PROSECUTIONS ARE NOT MADE OF DONALD TRUMP AND MARK MEADOWS AND HIS CHIEF ENABLERS OF THE COUP?  I -- I WILL BE SATISFIED IF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE APPROACHES THIS WITH COURAGE AND VIGOR. THEY'VE GOT TO REACH THE DECISION, NOT ME. AND OF COURSE WE'VE ALSO GOT PROCEEDINGS IN GEORGIA UNDER STATE LAW GOING ON IN TERMS OF THE INTERFERENCE IN GEORGIA. SO, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROSECUTORS TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY, THAT THEY'RE NOT AFRAID TO ACT, IF THE EVIDENCE IS PRESENT AT A STANDARD SUFFICIENT. AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T -- YOU KNOW, WE SPEND SO MUCH TIME ON THIS. WE HAVE -- I THOUGHT WE MADE THE CASE. WE'VE PROVIDED JUST A HUGE AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE, AND THERE'S MORE TO COME. THE FOOTNOTES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TRANSCRIPTS, SO ALL EXHIBITS ARE GOING TO BE RELEASED IN THE COMING DAYS PRETTY SOON. SO, THERE'S EVEN MORE MATERIAL THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR WHAT HAPPENED HERE, BUT THEY NEED TO MAKE THEIR DECISION.  I HAVE CHANGED THE INK ON MY PRINTER TWICE NOW, AS I KEEP PRINTING THESE MASSIVE VOLUMES. IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH INFORMATION THAT YOU WERE ALL TRYING TO PROTECT, AS THE INVESTIGATION WAS ONGOING. SO, FOR ALWAYS COMING ON AND BEING A GOOD SPORT AND SHARING WHAT YOU COULD AND TAKING OUR QUESTIONS BEFORE THE REPORT WAS COMPLETE, I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU TODAY.  WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IT'S BEEN, YOU KNOW, A TREMENDOUS HONOR TO BE A PART OF THE COMMITTEE. AND I'VE ENJOYED BEING ON WITH YOU AND TELLING YOU WHAT I COULD WHILE TRYING TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO VIOLATE THE COMMITTEE RULES.  YOU'RE NOT OFF THE HOOK WITH US YET. AS WE GET THROUGH IT, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP PEPPERING YOU WITH QUESTIONS. CONGRESSWOMAN ZOE LOFGREN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STARTING US OFF THIS HOUR.  YOU TAKE CARE.  THANK YOU. > JOINING OUR CONVERSATION, \"NEW YORK TIMES\" CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, BOB -- LUKE, YOU HAD THE BEST BEHIND-THE-CURTAINS REPORTING. AT NO POINT DID WE KNOW EVERYTHING THAT THEY KNEW. AND CONGRESSWOMAN LOFGREN WAS SUCH A GOOD SPORT ABOUT FIELDING THE QUESTIONS AND SAYING WHAT SHE COULD AND COULDN'T SAY. WHEN YOU READ WHAT THEY HAD AND WHAT THEY WERE SITTING ON UNTIL THE END, IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PORTRAIT. AS SHE SAID, THAT HUTCHINSON TRANSCRIPT READS LIKE A CRUMMY SCRIPT FOR A MOB FAMILY THE WAY THEY TALKED TO HER.  ACTUALLY THE COMMITTEE HAD SO MUCH EVIDENCE, IT WOULD BE HARD FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL PERSON TO KNOW IT ALL. YOU HAD CLOSE TO I THINK 80 STAFFERS IF YOU COUNT THE CONTRACTORS AND THE STAFF OF THE DIFFERENT MEMBERS WORKING ON THIS CASE AND DOING ALL THESE INTERVIEWS. I MEAN, JUST IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, WE'VE HAD 13,000 PAGES OF TRANSCRIPTS RELEASED. AND THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT THREADS TO FOLLOW, WHETHER IT'S THE SECURITY FAILURES OR THE FINANCING OF JANUARY 6th OR THE EXTREMIST GROUPS OR INSIDE TRUMP'S INNER CIRCLE. SO, THE AMOUNT OF WORK AND EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE ACCUMULATED I THINK IS WITHOUT PRECEDENT IN CONGRESSIONAL HISTORY. AND WE'RE STILL LEARNING MORE OF IT, THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE MORE EXHIBITS TO PUT OUT, THE FACT WE HAVE 20 NEW TRANSCRIPTS A DAY. WE'VE PROBABLY GOT 200 MORE TRANSCRIPTS COMING BY TUESDAY. YOU KNOW, I STILL THINK THERE ARE STILL NEW REVELATIONS TO LEARN, NEW DETAILS TO UNCOVER, AND MANY MORE STORIES TO WRITE.  I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AND EVERY TRANSCRIPT HAS SOMETHING IN IT THAT ANSWERS -- CLOSES A LOOP OR ANSWERS A QUESTION THAT WAS SORT OF ON THE TABLE IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS COMMITTEE HAD GATHERED AND HOW IT INTERSECTED WITH OTHER PIECES. GLEN, I WONDER -- AND I CONSTANTLY REMIND MYSELF AND MY VIEWERS, AND THE CONGRESSWOMAN JUST SAID IT. THE INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED BY FORMER U.S. ATTORNEYS AND ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEYS, SO THE DOCUMENTS THEY'RE TURNING OVER WILL BE VERY RECOGNIZABLE AND VERY MUCH UP TO SNUFF AT DOJ. THEY ARE IN SOME INSTANCES LIKELY THEIR FORMER PEERS. WHAT IS THE DYNAMIC OF A CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION GOING SO DEEP AND SO FAR AHEAD OF THE DOJ?  YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY, NICOLLE, IT'S UNPRECEDENTED. DOJ TYPICALLY TAKES THE LEAD IN INVESTIGATING FEDERAL CRIMES. WHEN I WAS A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR, WE VERY MUCH WANTED TO KEEP OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AWAY FROM OUR WITNESSES. THE WITNESSES THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO RELY ON IN FUTURE CRIMINAL TRIALS, WE WANTED TO BE THE ONE TO LOCK IN, SO TO SPEAK, THEIR TESTIMONY. WE WANTED TO CRAFT IT -- AND I DON'T MEAN IN A NEFARIOUS WAY. WE WANTED IT TO BE FULL, ACCURATE, COMPLETE, TRUTHFUL, AND CORROBORATED BY WHAT WE KNEW OTHER WITNESSES AND OTHER DOCUMENTS WERE TELLING US AS PART OF THE INVESTIGATION. BUT I WILL TELL YOU, NICOLLE, I'VE BEEN VERY HEARTENED BY WHAT I'VE SEEN OF THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE'S WORK AND ITS REPORT. AND LET'S FACE IT. IT IS HEADED UP BY THE CHIEF INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL TIM IFFY, ONE OF MY FORMER RICO PARTNERS AT THE D.C. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND A LONG-TIME FRIEND. AND I CAN SEE THE WAY HE AND HIS TEAM OF FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTORS HAVE CRAFTED THIS INVESTIGATION. AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY EFFECTIVE NOW THAT ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION IS BEING HANDED OFF TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SECOND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN CONDUCTED, AND NOW DOJ JUST HAS TO PICK UP THE BALL AND RUN WITH IT.  YEAH, I WANT TO PRESS YOU ON THAT. I THINK LUKE BROKE THE STORY WITH HIS COLLEAGUES ABOUT MR. IFFY AND HIS FEDERAL INVESTIGATORS' USE OF CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE TOOLS. SO, I WANT TO ASK BOTH OF YOU TO HELP ME SEE WHERE THE EVIDENCE OF THE TOOLS ARE IN THIS REPORT. WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON WHAT IS NEXT FOR THE JANUARY 6th INVESTIGATION AND WHAT WE CAN EXPECT FROM THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH. ALSO AHEAD, THE FUTURE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN OUR COUNTRY AFTER THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNED ROE THIS YEAR. WE'LL TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT WHERE THE BATTLE OVER ABORTION RIGHTS HEADS IN 2023. DEDLINE WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES AFTER A QUICK BREAK. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. TER A QUICK B. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. 20221229222350.992|20221229222715.195",

        "trs": "> CHAIRMAN THOMPSON, DISTINGUISHED CAUCUS, VICE CHAIR LIZ CHENEY, AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR PERSISTENT PATRIOTIC LEADERSHIP. THE 107th CONGRESS BEGAN WITH A VIOLENT ASSAULT ON OUR DEMOCRACY, AND NOW WE HEAR ITS CONCLUSIONS. WE HAVE A VITAL ROADMAP IN ENSURING JUSTICE WILL BE DONE AND THAT THIS WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.  WE'RE BACK WITH LUKE AND GLEN. IT IS AN OPTIMISTIC THING TO SAY, RIGHT, THAT WE HOPE IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. THE TRUTH IS THE FINAL REPORT HAS ALL SORTS OF LOOSE ENDS ABOUT REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. LUKE, WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF WHAT THIS NEW TERM HOLDS FOR THE MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE?  OBVIOUSLY REPUBLICANS WILL BE IN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. THEY'VE ALREADY PLEDGED TO INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS. SO, WE CAN SEE WHY THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE IS RUSHING TO GET THESE TRANSCRIPTS OUT BEFORE CONGRESS CHANGES HANDS BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT IF REPUBLICANS GET AHOLD OF THEM BEFORE THEY'RE RELEASED, THEY WILL CHERRY PICK CERTAIN FACTS, CERTAIN EVIDENCE, PUT IT OUT, AND TRY TO EMBARRASS THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE. SO, THEY ARE TRYING TO GET EVERYTHING OUT THE DOOR QUICKLY BEFORE CONGRESS TURNS OVER. BUT, YOU KNOW, THEY WILL HAVE TO, I THINK, FEND OFF SOME OF THE ATTACKS FROM THE REPUBLICANS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. WE SAW JAMIE RASKIN GET ELEVATED TO BE THE TOP DEMOCRAT ON HOUSE OVERSIGHT. I BELIEVE HIS COLLEAGUES THINK THAT HE IS A SKILLED DEFENDER OF DEMOCRACY AND OF DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND THAT HE IS THE PERSON THAT CAN BEST DEFEND THEM FROM SOME OF THESE ATTACKS THE REPUBLICANS WILL BE LEVELING. OBVIOUSLY HE'S UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR CANCER. SO, YOU KNOW, ALL THE WELL WISHES AND PRAYERS GO OUT TO HIM. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BRACE THEMSELVES. THE TABLES ARE GOING TO BE TURNED. THEY'RE GOING TO BE -- THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO HAVE POWER, AND IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE ON CAPITOL HILL.  I'M STRUCK BY HOW MANY REPUBLICANS MADE THIS 875-PAGE REPORT WHAT IT IS. THEY'RE NOT JUST CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICANS. THEY'RE TRUMP REPUBLICANS. AND YET NONE OF TRUMP'S ALLIES IN CONGRESS DANE TO VOLUNTARILY COME IN AND VISIT AND SIT WITH THE SELECT COMMITTEE. WHAT DYNAMIC DOES THAT PUT INTO MOTION IN THE NEW YEAR?  YOU KNOW, I THINK A TROUBLING DYNAMIC. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THREATS OF INVESTIGATIONS BEING LAUNCHED AGAINST THE INVESTIGATORS, THAT RUNS A CHILL UP MY SPINE BECAUSE I THINK ABOUT MY TIME AS A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR. WHEN I WAS ASSIGNED A CASE TO INVESTIGATE AND I WOULD DO BY DILIGENT AND ETHICAL BEST TO INVESTIGATE IT TO AN APPROPRIATE CONCLUSION, AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU, NICOLLE, IF I HAD SOMEBODY COME IN BEHIND THAT AND SAY, GLEN, NOW WE'RE GOING TO INVESTIGATE YOU FOR DOING YOUR JOB AND INVESTIGATING SUSPECTED CRIME, THAT'S KIND OF A RECIPE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT CHAOS AND ANARCHY AND PERHAPS PARALYSIS. IF YOU KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, AS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL, AS A PUBLIC SERVANT, YOU'RE GOING TO GET CRITICIZED AND PERHAPS INVESTIGATED FOR DOING A JOB YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HONORABLY AND ETHICALLY -- I MEAN, I HOPE WE'VE LEARNED OUR LESSONS FROM WHAT SEEMS LIKE A COMPLETE FAILURE OF THE DURHAM INVESTIGATION TO INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS. IT REALLY CAME UP WITH ALMOST NOTHING. SOME IMPORTANT MINOR MISCONDUCT THAT WAS ADDRESSED. BUT LET'S HOPE THAT PEOPLE TAKE A STEP BACK AND LEARN THOSE IMPORTANT LESSONS.  I WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU, GLEN. I MEAN, AS YOU LOOK AT THE -- AND TO LUKE'S POINT, YOU CAN FEEL THE FRENETIC PACE OF PUSHING ALL THEIR CONTENT OUT THE DOOR SO IT IS ALL IN THE PUBLIC ARENA. AND THAT WAS REPORTS OF REPUBLICANS WANT TO INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS JUST BROKE. THEIR PLAN WAS ALWAYS TO GET EVERYTHING INTO PUBLIC VIEW. WHEN YOU SEE THE CONTENT OF THESE TRANSCRIPTS AND THE DEGREE OF BRAZEN CRIMINALITY, BRAZEN WITNESS TAMPERING, BRAZEN EFFORTS TO REFUSE TO STOP AN INSURRECTION, BRAZEN ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT THE EASTMAN PROJECT WAS ILLEGAL, BUT LET'S GO WITH IT ANYWAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK DOJ -- YOU HAVE TO TRIAGE ALL OF THIS EVIDENCE. WHAT ARE YOU DIVING INTO FIRST?  YEAH, THE TRIAGE PIECE IS A REAL CHALLENGE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS ITS HANDS ON OR WILL SOON GET ITS HANDS ON SOME 1,200 TRANSCRIPTS. AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PRETTY QUICKLY ASSESS WHICH ONES ARE MOST IMPORTANT FOR THEIR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. BUT, YOU KNOW, THE WORK HAS SORT OF ONLY JUST BEGUN WHEN THEY GET THOSE TRANSCRIPTS BECAUSE THEN THEY HAVE TO GET THE WITNESS IN, THEY HAVE TO REVIEW THE TRANSCRIPT, THEY HAVE TO BUILD ON IT IF NEED BE IN THE GRAND JURY BY PRESENTING THAT WITNESS ANEW TO THE GRAND JURY. NOW, I WILL SAY, WE OFTEN PRESENT WITNESSES TO A GRAND JURY WHEN WE'RE IN POSSESSION OF PRIOR TRANSCRIPTS FROM OTHER AGENCIES OR ORGANIZATIONS. AND IF EVERYTHING IS IN THAT TRANSCRIPT, WE CAN SIMPLY CALL THE WITNESS BEFORE THE GRAND JURY, HAVE THEM ADOPT THE TRANSCRIPT AS THE SUBSTANCE OF THEIR GRAND JURY TESTIMONY, AND PERHAPS ASK A HANDFUL OF FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO FURTHER DEVELOP THE RECORD IF NEED BE. SO, THESE TRANSCRIPTS ARE SORT OF A BLESSING AND A CURSE. THERE'S SO MUCH INFORMATION THERE THAT I'M SURE WILL BE HELPFUL. BUT, BOY, IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TO REALLY FULLY INCLUDE IT IN THE GRAND JURY PRESENTATION.  AND, LUKE, CONGRESSWOMAN LOFGREN WAS A LITTLE CIRCUMSPECT AND A LITTLE ZEN ABOUT WHAT DOJ ULTIMATELY DOES. OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE BEEN FORWARD LEANING. LIZ CHENEY SAYING IF THERE ISN'T PROSECUTION OF TRUMP, IT REALLY CALLS INTO QUESTION WHETHER THE RULE OF LAW IS ALIVE AND WELL IN AMERICA. WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF THE DIVERSITY OF OPINIONS AMONG THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THEMSELVES AND THE INVESTIGATORS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TRUMP IS NOW PROSECUTED?  RIGHT, I MEAN, I THINK THEY WOULDN'T HAVE MADE THE REFERRAL IF THEY WEREN'T ALL IN UNISON THAT THEY THOUGHT HE COMMITTED FEDERAL CRIMES AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND POTENTIALLY INDICTED FOR THEM. THEY MAY HAVE DIFFERENT APPROACHES IN TERMS OF THEIR TENOR AND HOW AGGRESSIVELY THEY SPEAK ABOUT IT. AND SOME HAVE TO BE BROUGHT ALONG ABOUT THE CRIMINAL REFERRALS. SOME DIDN'T VIEW IT AS THEIR ROLE IN CONGRESS. THEY DIDN'T VIEW IT AS THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH'S ROLE. BUT I THINK WHAT WON OUT IN THE END WAS THAT IF YOU'VE DONE ALL THIS WORK, IF YOU'VE DONE ALL THESE INTERVIEWS, COLLECTED ALL THESE DOCUMENTS, AND YOU'VE BUILT WHAT YOU BELIEVE IS AN AIR-TIGHT CASE, AND YOU CAN MAKE THE LEGAL ARGUMENT THAT THEY BELIEVE COULD GO BEFORE A GRAND JURY RIGHT NOW, THEN WHY WOULDN'T YOU PRESENT THIS EVIDENCE IN THE FORM OF A CRIMINAL REFERRAL TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT? IN SOME WAYS, THEY BELIEVED IT WAS THEIR DUTY TO DO THAT. SO, I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, IF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT TAKE A CASE TO THE GRAND JURY AGAINST TRUMP, I COULD SEE, YOU KNOW, ADAM SCHIFF AND SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE BEING VERY CRITICAL ABOUT MERRICK GARLAND AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. AND YOU CAN SEE SORT OF A SPECTER HANGING OVER HIS HEAD WHERE CONGRESS HAS AMASSED ALL THIS EVIDENCE AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT HASN'T DONE ANYTHING WITH IT. AND THAT REALLY BEING A PUBLIC PROBLEM FOR MERRICK GARLAND. SO, I WOULD -- IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME AT ALL IF THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE, EVEN IN THE MINORITY, IF THOSE MEMBERS CONTINUE TO PUT PRESSURE ON MERRICK GARLAND AND TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO PURSUE AN AGGRESSIVE INVESTIGATION AGAINST DONALD TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING PART OF OUR COVERAGE TODAY. > WHEN WE COME BACK, 2022 WAS THE YEAR IN WHICH MILLIONS OF WOMEN ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY LOST THE RIGHT TO ABORTION HEALTH CARE.

        "trs": "> IT HAS BEEN JUST OVER SIX MONTHS SINCE THE U.S. SUPREME COURT STRIPPED AWAY THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION IN AMERICA. CHILD RAPE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CROSS STATE LINES TO ACCESS HEALTH CARE OR WORSE, CARRY THEIR RAPIST'S BABIES TO TERM. THE WOMEN WHO WERE FORCED TO CARRY UNVIABLE PREGNANCIES, BECOMING SICKER AND SICKER AND SICKER, RISKING LIFE LONG INJURY OR DEATH. SADLY, IT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING. \"VICE NEWS\" IS REPORTING THAT THE ANTIABORTION RIGHTS MOVEMENT IS NOT DONE YET. THEY WILL ONLY GET MORE DRACONIAN IN THEIR PROPOSALS HEADING INTO 2023. STATES WITH FIRST TRIMESTER BANS ARE LIKELY TO CONSIDER TOTAL BANS ON ABORTION. LEGISLATORS HAVE ALREADY FLOATED ATTEMPTING TO RESTRICT PEOPLE GOING OUT OF STATE FOR ABORTIONS. SOME ACTIVISTS ARE SUING PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO DISCUSS ABORTIONS. AND ANTIABORTION RIGHTS ADVOCATES ARE SUING TO REVOKE FDA APPROVAL FOR THE ABORTION PILL, WHICH COULD HAVE NATIONWIDE IMPACT ON ABORTION ACCESS AND HEALTH CARE. JOINING US, PRESIDENT OF PRO CHOICE AMERICA, AND DR. KAVITA PATEL, FORMER OBAMA HEALTH POLICY DIRECTOR, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR. I WANT TO START WITH BOTH OF YOU BEFORE WE GET INTO THE POLITICS, WHICH FOR REPUBLICANS ARE ABYSMAL, BUT THEY ARE UNDETERRED WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY TO WOMEN AND CHILDREN. JUST TELL ME WHAT THE PICTURE LOOKS LIKE, ESPECIALLY IN THE STATES WITH THE MOST RESTRICTIVE BANS.  RIGHT NOW -- THANKS, NICOLLE, FOR HAVING ME. \"VICE NEWS\" AND YOUR COVERAGE COULDN'T BE MORE ACCURATE. WE'VE GOT 17 ACTIVE ABORTION BANS RIGHT NOW. WE'VE GOT VARIOUS LITIGATION IN VARIOUS STATES. THAT NUMBER KEEPS EBBING AND FLOWING, BUT ABOUT 17 RIGHT NOW. WE'RE LOOKING AT POTENTIAL BANS IN ALASKA, FLORIDA, NORTH DAKOTA, MONTANA, OHIO, VIRGINIA, AND GEORGIA, WHERE WE JUST HAD SOME REALLY TOUGH ELECTION RESULTS. AND WE KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE, IN GEORGIA THAT GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT HE'S OPEN TO ADDITIONAL BANS ON CONTRACEPTION AND IVF. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN 2023 IS DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO EXPAND RIGHTS FOR STATES FRIENDLY IN REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM, PREVENT HARM, AND GAIN GROUND IN STATES THAT ARE CHALLENGING, STATES I JUST MENTIONED, AND PREP FOR 2024 WHEN WE HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN BACK THE HOUSE AND PASS FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT COULD PROTECT AND RESTORE ROE BUT ALSO EXPAND NATIONALLY AND HELP US WITH ISSUES LIKE TRAVEL AND ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION, WHICH ARE ON THE TABLE AND LEGISLATIVE FIGHTS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IN CONGRESS NEXT YEAR.  WHAT'S SO CHILLING IS YOU'RE DESCRIBING THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO IS WOMEN, IN LOTS OF INSTANCES, VULNERABLE WOMEN, LOW INCOME WOMEN, HAVING TO FLEE THEIR STATES. AND WHAT THE REPUBLICANS SEEM TO BE PROPOSING ARE BANS TO TRAP THEM THERE. TELL ME HOW THAT PLAYS OUT. WHO GETS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND WHO DOESN'T?  IT'S NOT A HYPOTHETICAL ANYMORE, RIGHT? IN GEORGIA AND TEXAS WE'VE HAD THESE LAWS ON THE BOOKS FOR QUITE SOME TIME NOW. I HATE TO BE A BROKEN RECORD, BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT MY HOME STATE OF TEXAS TO UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES. WE'RE ALREADY SEEING IN A PLACE LIKE TEXAS, WHERE ONE OUT OF TEN AMERICAN WOMEN LIVE, VERY, VERY CHALLENGING STORIES, SOME OF THE MOST TERRIFYING STORIES OF FOLKS BEING FORCED INTO BIRTH, RESTRICTING ACCESS TO PROCEDURES THEY NEED THAT ARE LIFE-SAVING, LIKE CANCER TREATMENTS, BEING PROSECUTED FOR MISCARRIAGE MANAGEMENT, DOCTORS BEING AFRAID TO DO THEIR JOBS. IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING IN TEXAS. AND I WANT TO MAKE A NOTE -- YOU KNOW, YOU'VE COVERED IT REALLY WELL. THE STATES THAT HAVE THE WORST ABORTION BANS AND ACCESS ISSUES ARE THE STATES WITH THE WORST INVESTMENT FOR MATERNAL HEALTH AND CHILD CARE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PAID FAMILY NEED. SO, THESE ARE BAD STATES FOR WOMEN, PERIOD.  DR. PATEL, I WANT YOUR SORT OF TAKE FROM INSIDE THE PHYSICIANS' OFFICES. WHAT ARE DOCTORS, ESPECIALLY IN STATES WITH THESE DRACONIAN LAWS, WHAT ARE THEY FACING IN TERMS OF THE LIMITS OF HOW THEY CAN CARE FOR THEIR PATIENTS?  INSIDE MANY OF THESE STATES, NICOLLE, THEY'RE FACING NOT ONLY -- WE'VE ALREADY SEEN CASES BROUGHT BY THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND HAVE ALREADY TRIED TO TAKE AWAY NOT ONLY PHYSICIANS' LICENSES BUT THERE'S CRIMINAL STATUTES IN PLACE SO THAT THESE ARE PHYSICIANS -- NOT JUSTIFY SITUATIONS, BUT ANYONE IN THEIR CARE TEAM OR ANYONE HELPING AN INDIVIDUAL TO ACCESS REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, THAT THEY COULD ALSO HAVE CRIMINAL PENALTIES AGAINST THEM. MONETARY, CIVIL, AND CRIMINAL. ALL OF THAT ADDS UP TO PUTTING HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IN A STATE OF QUANDARY. IN FACT, IN A SURVEY OF MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS DONE IN IDAHO AND TENNESSEE, TWO STATES WHERE IT HAS NOT BEEN A SHORT HISTORY OF TARGETED REGULATIONS AGAINST ABORTION PROVIDERS, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY BACK AND FORTH DECISIONS AND STATE LEGISLATURES AND CONCLUSION THAT EVEN HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE STATE OF THE LAW WAS AND THAT THEY WOULD LIKELY DEFAULT TO DOING THE LEAST UNTIL THEY COULD CHECK WITH HOSPITAL COUNSEL OR WITH SOMEBODY. AND COULD YOU IMAGINE? SO, WHAT'S HAPPENING IS NOT ONLY ARE THERE WOMEN AND TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS WHO CAN'T ACCESS THEIR HEALTH CARE. BUT ON TOP OF THAT, EVEN IF YOU TRY -- YOU MAKE IT TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM, THERE IS ACTUALLY A TIMEOUT AND A PAUSE MOMENT WHERE TEAMS ARE HAVING TO FIND OUT IF THAT INDIVIDUAL IS IN SUCH A DIRE SITUATION THAT THEIR LIFE IS IN JEOPARDY AND THEN HAVING TO MAKE CLINICAL DECISIONS. AND WE HAVE A RECENTLY RELEASED STUDY YESTERDAY FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA THAT SAYS THE STATES THAT HAVE THE TARGETED REGULATIONS ON ABORTION PROVIDERS, THAT WE SEE AN ALMOST 6% HIGHER RELATIVE SUICIDE RATE IN PATIENTS. THIS ISN'T JUST HYPOTHETICAL. THIS IS NUMBERS SHOWING THAT PEOPLE ARE DYING.  I MEAN, THE ANXIETY AND THE FEAR IS BEING CREATED. IT SEEMS TO BE THE POINT ON THE RIGHT. THEY'RE NOW TARGETING ACCESS TO GOOGLING OR TRYING TO GET INFORMATION ONLINE ABOUT ABORTION PILLS, TRYING TO TARGET THAT CONTENT THE SAME WAY THEY TARGET CHILD PORNOGRAPHY. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF THEY COULD TARGET INSURRECTION ENTHUSIASM WITH THE SAME TECHNOLOGY, BUT THAT'S NOT THEIR PLAN. DR. PATEL, WHAT'S ON THE TABLE IN TERMS OF MAKING ACCESS TO ABORTION MEDICATIONS MORE DIFFICULT AND OUT OF REACH AND POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL?  YEAH, SO, ALREADY WE'VE SEEN THAT THERE IS ATTEMPTS IN DIFFERENT STATES TO ACTUALLY CHANGE -- EVEN THOUGH THE FDA HAS REINFORCED, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE, CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES, ALMOST EVERY AGENCY AND JURISDICTION HAS ALREADY VOCALIZED THAT IT IS LEGAL ACROSS STATE BOUNDARIES, ESPECIALLY THROUGH TELEMEDICINE, WHICH IS ALSO LEGAL FOR ALL CIRCUMSTANCES RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF THE STATE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. BUT THE ABILITY TO EVEN JUST DESCRIBE MEDICATIONS OR DRIFR MEDICATIONS ACROSS STATE LINES IS BEING CALLED INTO QUESTION AS WELL AS PROVIDERS WITHIN STATES. IF I AM A PATIENT INSIDE A STATE WHERE I WANT ACCESS TO A MEDICAL ABORTION, THERE IS POTENTIAL LAWS ON THE BOOKS AT THE STATE LEVEL -- THIS IS GOING TO PLAY OUT AT THE STATE LEVEL. THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION HAS WEIGHED IN THAT THIS IS LEGAL, THIS IS SAFE. THEY CAN DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO SCARE NOT JUST THE PROVIDERS, BUT TO SCARE PEOPLE FROM SEEKING OUT THIS INFORMATION. SO, ALL THE TARGETED ADS THAT WE WOULD NORMALLY HOPE COULD REACH PEOPLE IN PLACES THEY ARE, ONLINE SHOPPING, THOSE THINGS. YOU'RE SEEING THOSE THINGS BEING TAKEN DOWN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID ANYONE PUTTING UP THOSE ADS WILL BE TARGETED. THERE ARE MANY OF US WHO ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP NOT JUST THE STATES WE HAVE SEEN THESE DRACONIAN LAWS BEING PROPOSED OR PASSED, BUT EVEN IN THE STATES LIKE MARYLAND, WHERE I ENJOY THE RIGHTS TO DO A LOT OF THIS, BUT PROVIDERS ARE FEELING SLIGHTLY DEFENSIVE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE REINFORCE WHAT IS SAFE AND HEALTHY AND ACCESSIBLE. AND ALL THREE OF THOSE TERMS ARE BEING REDEFINED BY POLL SITUATIONS, NOT DOCTORS.  I WANT TO TURN TO THE POLITICS OF THIS NEXT. I'M GOING TO ASK BOTH OF YOU TO STICK AROUND. A QUICK BREAK FOR US. WE WILL ALL BE RIGHT BACK. ALL B. 20221229224903.202|20221229225141.093",

        "trs": "> WE ARE BACK. MINI, I WANT TO ASK YOU THIS QUESTION -- THE ENTIRE TIME I'VE WORK IN THE POLITICS, THE SUPREME COURT HAS BEEN A MOTIVATING ISSUE FOR THE RIGHT, SOMETHING THAT THEY FEEL PUTS THEM ON OFFENSE WITH THEIR VOTERS. THE LARGEST STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN POLITICS IN MY LIFE IS THAT THE SUPREME COURT IS NOW A POLITICAL DEADWEIGHT. IT'S APPROVAL DROPPED MORE THAN 40 POINTS IN LESS THAN 20 YEARS. IN ONE YEAR, DOWN 11 POINTS FROM 2021 TO 2022. WE DID COVERAGE YESTERDAY ABOUT ASYLUM SEEKERS THAT HAVE SUPPORT OF 55% OF ALL AMERICANS. THE SUPREME COURT MADE IT DIFFICULT WITH TITLE 42, WHICH HAS THE SUPPORT OF ONLY 21% OF AMERICANS. THE IRONY OF SUCH A POPULAR AND UNTRUSTED BODY MAKING DECISIONS THAT COST MITCH McCONNELL THE MAJORITY A SECOND TIME, IT WOULD BE FUNNY IF IT WASN'T DOING SO MUCH HARM TO AMERICAN WOMEN, BUT I WONDER WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ABOUT MAINTAINING THE POLITICAL MOMENTUM OF POLICIES AND POLITICS.  IT'S SUCH A GREAT POINT. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU PROBABLY SAW A LOT OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS CALLING FOR AFTER THE EXPLOSIVE \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORT ABOUT THE HOBBY LOBBY LEAKS AND THE LONG EXTENSIVE INFILTRATION OF THE COURT BY ANTI-CHOICE EXTREMISTS IS THE FACT THAT A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS ARE CALLING FOR MORE AGGRESSIVE INVESTIGATION OF THIS COURT. THE HOUSE JUDICIARY DID SOMETHING LAST MONTH -- EARLIER THIS MONTH, WHICH WAS A REALLY EFFECTIVE START. WE'D LOVE TO SEE SENATE JUDICIARY DO AN IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION. FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ADVOCATES, IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE TWO SIGNIFICANT LEAKS, HOBBY LOBBY AND DOBBS WERE DONE IN REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS CASES AND WERE CREATED, IT SOUNDS LIKE, BY ANTI-CHOICE EXTREMISTS INFILTRATING THE COURT. SO THE CREDIBILITY OF THIS COURT IS VERY MUCH UP TO QUESTION. ADVOCATES AND AL LICE OF OUR ORGANIZATION WANT TO SEE IT QUESTIONED AND WANT TO SEE CONGRESS TAKE A MORE AGGRESSIVE HAND AND THE POLITICS AROUND THE COURT ARE GOING TO BE CRITICAL FOR HOW DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO BE SEEN BY ACTIVISTS AND THEIR BASE OF WOMEN VOTER WHO IS NARROWLY HELPED THEM HANG ON TO THE SENATE AND NARROWLY LOST THE HOUSE. WE HAVE TO SHOW THEM WE'RE FIGHTING FOR THEM, AND THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE.  DR. PATEL, I THINK OF JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR'S COMMENT ABOUT THE STENCH OF THE DOBBS CASE EVERYONE MAKING IT TO THE COURT. SHE WAS WASN'T MALIGNING HER COLLEAGUES. SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE STATE LEGISLATURE UNTIL GORSUCH AND KAVANAUGH AND CONEY BARRETT WERE SEATED. THE STENCH IN THE EYES OF VOTERS IS THIS FEELING THAT IT'S ALL RIGGED, THAT THESE EXTREMISTS, WHO ARE PASSING ABORTION BANS OUT IN THE STATES THAT BAN ACCESS TO ABORTION, EVEN IN THE CASE OF LIFE OF THE MOTHER, RAPE, AND INCEST -- THOSE ARE OPPOSED BY 85% TO 90% OF ALL AMERICANS. AND THAT'S WHERE THIS REPUBLICAN PARTY IS HEADING. HOW DO YOU KEEP THE DISPARITY BETWEEN WHAT IS A LEGITIMATE DEBATE ABOUT ACCESS TO ABORTION WITH THE EXTREMISM THAT'S BEEN USHERED IN BY THIS SUPREME COURT?  I MEAN, JUST -- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO KEEP THAT DISPARITY FROM WIDENING OTHER THAN TO SAY THAT WE HAVE TO JUST GET RAGING MAD, AND WHEN I SAY THAT AS A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL, I TRY TO KEEP POLITICS OUT OF THE EXAM ROOM, BUT VI TOO MANY FEELINGS WE'RE CONSIDERED SEPARATE AND UNEQUAL, AND THAT STENCH CARRIED OVER. REGARDLESS OF YOUR POLITICS YOU SHOULD BE DISGRACED BY THE FACT THAT SOMEONE IS SINGLING OUT NOT JUST THE BEST SCIENCE, THE BEST MEDICINE, BUT YOUR RIGHTS, AND I THINK THAT'S THE STENCH THAT NEEDS TO CARRY OVER. WE CAN'T RELAX ON WHAT WE HAVE HAD. WE HAVE TO FIGHT FORWARD. CLOSE THAT DISPARITY AND SHOW THE COUNTRY THAT SOMETHING'S POSSIBLE WHEN YOU ALL KIND OF GATHER AROUND, REGARDLESS OF PARTY POLITICS, TO DO AND STAND UP FOR WHAT'S RIGHT.  YEAH, AND I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT ROE AND CASEY WERE DECIDED WITH JUSTICES WHO WERE APPOINTED BY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS. IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST THE MAKEUP, IT IS THE MAKEUP OF THIS PARTICULAR SUPREME COURT. DO YOU HAVE ANY CLOSING THOUGHTS ABOUT SORT OF HEADING INTO THE NEW YEAR WITH PROTECTING WOMEN AND TALKING ABOUT THIS IN A PRODUCTIVE WAY IN MIND?  JUST TO PIGGY BACK OFF YOUR LAST COMMENT, FOLKS FORGET RICHARD NIXON WAS THE PERSON WHO SHEPHERDED TITLE 10, A FUNDAMENTAL FUNDING STREAM FOR CONTRACEPTION THAT'S UNDER ATTACK. BARRY GOLDWATER WAS A FAMOUS PRO-CHOICE REPUBLICAN. THERE WERE TIMES WE HAD FAMOUS PRO-CHOICE REPUBLICAN LEADERS IN THIS COUNTRY, AND I HOPE WE CAN GET BACK TO THAT. MY CLOSING THOUGHTS FOR 2023, THE ELECTIONS AREN'T OVER, UNFORTUNATELY. I KNOW PEOPLE ARE TIRED. WE HAVE A STATE SUPREME COURT FIGHT IN WISCONSIN. IF WE CAN FLIP IT, WE CAN FUNDAMENTALLY RESHAPE ABORTION RIGHTS IN WISCONSIN. WE'VE GOT THREE SPECIAL ELECTIONS IN THE PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE THAT IF WE LOSE, IF DEMOCRATS LOSE, AN ABORTION BAN WOULD RICOCHET THROUGH THAT LEGISLATURE. SO IT'S NOT OVER, FOLKS. THEN WE'LL BE WORKING REALLY HARD TO GET IT DONE.  WE'RE NOT TIRED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SPENDING TIME WITH US. TO BE CONTINUED. > QUICK BREAK FOR US. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

YOU HAVE A RIGHT FOR A REFUND OF ANY TICKET WHERE THE AIRLINE CANCELS IT.  Reporter: COMING TO REIMBURSEMENTS THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A GUARANTEE.  MAY HAVE TO EXTEND THE MONEY AND HOPE THE AIRLINE WILL HONOR IT.  BLAYNE ALEXANDER WITH THAT REPORT. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO REPORT TO SHOW IF THE PEOPLE GOT THE MONEY BACK.  THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT INTO WHAT HAPPENED. > PRESIDENT BIDEN IS IN ST. CROIX THIS MORNING. HE GOT THERE NOT ON SOUTHWEST. HE'S SCHEDULED TO RETURN TO WASHINGTON ON JANUARY 2, THE DAY BEFORE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CEDES CONTROL OF THE HOUSE THE REPUBLICANS. LOOMING IS THE DECISION WHETHER TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. MIKE MEMOLI DREW THE TOUGH REPORTING ASSIGNMENT LIVE FROM ST. CROIX. COME ON! YOU WIN. WE LOSE. PRESIDENT BIDEN SHOULD TAKE REST BECAUSE HE IS COMING BACK TO A LOT. QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE BUT ALSO A DIVIDED WASHINGTON AND HOUSE GOP INTENT TO MAKE LIFE VERY CHALLENGING FOR THE PRESIDENT AND HIS WEST WING.  Reporter: YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT. I TAKE A BACKSEAT TO NOBODY COMING TO THE PRESIDENTIAL VACATION ASSIGNMENT. I HAD THE DUTY TO TRAVEL BACK AND FORTH TO WAIKIKI IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND LAST YEAR SPENT THE WEEK IN A SIMILAR PA ARE DICE. DELAWARE.  LOVE IT.  Reporter: THEY RESUME A TRADITION OF A DECADE COMING HERE TO ST. CROIX. FIRST TIME AS THE PRESIDENT AND THE FIRST SITTING PRESIDENT SINCE TRUMAN ARRIVING BY YACHT. THIS IS AN UNUSUAL POLITICAL MOMENT. WE HAVEN'T HAD WHAT WE SEE RIGHT NOW WHICH IS MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENT'S PARTY QUESTIONING WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRESIDENT WILL SEEK RE-ELECTION. AND SO THAT'S THE BACKDROP AGAINST WHICH PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS COME HERE. I WILL SAY THERE'S BEEN A LOT TALK ABOUT THE FAMILY MEETING AN IMPORTANT DECISION POINT FOR THE BIDENS OVER THE YEARS. MY REPORTING AND THE CONVERSATION THAT COLLEAGUES AND I HAD WITH DR. JILL BIDEN IN OCTOBER REPORTING THAT THE FAMILY IS FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF PRESIDENT BIDEN SEEKING ANOTHER TERM IS DOWN PLAYED. THE PRESIDENT IS CLEAR. EVERY TIME ASKED ABOUT THIS HE INTEND TO RUN FOR RE-ELECTION. SECOND PART HE SAYS I'M A GREAT RESPECTER OF FAITH. IN 2016 CONSIDERING A RUN. DEATH OF HIS SON BEAU INTERCEDED. ALL SIGNS ARE THAT THE PRESIDENT IS POINTING TOWARDS RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION. THIS IS A TIME FOR HIM TO ENJOY THE TIME WITH HIS FAMILY. HIS DAUGHTER ASHLEY, TWO GRAND CHILDREN ARE HERE. PEOPLE HERE ARE INTENDING TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT SPACE TO ENJOY THE TIME OFF. IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF A STAFF FOOTPRINT. JAKE SULLIVAN IS HERE BUT DEALING WITH THE NEW REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IS UNDER WAY FOR WEEKS. THEY LOOK AT THE NEW REPUBLICAN MAJORITY AS POTENTIALLY A GOOD POLITICAL FOYLE FOR THE PRESIDENT. THEY WILL BE FOCUSED ON THE SUCCESSFUL LEGISLATIVE TRACK RECORD OVER TWO YEARS WITH A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS AND WHILE THEY FOCUS ON CUTTING RIBBONS, MORE JOBS ANNOUNCEMENTS, THE NEW PROVISIONS OF THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT, THEY'RE HAPPY TO LET REPUBLICANS SEND A FLURRY OF LOTTERS AND LAUNCH INVESTIGATIONS THEY THINK THE PUBLIC WILL NOT BE RECEPTIVE TO. THE PRESIDENT MADE CLEAR. HE DOES SEE SOME HOPE FOR LEGISLATING AND A FACTION OF THAT NEW REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN BIDEN DISTRICTS AND MORE THAN ANYTHING LOOKING TO CONFIRM MORE JUDGES.  NBC'S MIKE MEMOLI, THE FIRST MAN TO WEAR A SUIT ON THE BEACH ON A PRESIDENTIAL TRIP SINCE NIXON HIMSELF DID IT IN THE 1970s. HISTORY MADE THIS MORNING ON \"MORNING JOE.\" PUT SUNSCREEN ON. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. > REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN HITTING THE PRESIDENT ABOUT HOW PRICES ARE STILL HIGH. INFLATION COOLED BUT HIGHER. THERE'S AN AREA WHERE THINGS ARE CHEAP JER THAT'S THE PUMP. EXPERTS SAY THE COST OF GAS EXPECTED TO BE CHEAPER OVERALL IN 2023. CORRESPONDENT KERRY SANDERS HAS THE LATEST ON THAT STORY.  Reporter: POSITIVE NEWS AT THE PUMP THIS MORNING. ESTIMATES FOR 2023 PREDICT GAS PRICES CHEAPER OVERALL NEXT YEAR.  I THINK I WOULD BE HAPPY.  Reporter: THOSE SAVINGS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SIGNIFICANT. ON AVERAGE GAS SHOULD COST NEARLY 50 CENTS LESS PER GALLON IN 2023. THE PRICE OF GAS IS EXPECTED TO BE DOWN NOT UP. YOU SAY --  IT IS A WELCOMED THING.  Reporter: WELCOMED FOR DRIVERS HERE AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY AFTER CONSISTENTLY HIGH FUEL PRICES DOMINATED IN 2022 AND SET OFF INFLATION ALARM BELLS AND CRUSHED CONFIDENCE.  HORRIFIC. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?  Reporter: BETWEEN NOW AND MAY OF 2023 PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN LOW BUT SLIGHT INKROESS IN THE WARMER MONTHS. WITH PRIUSES POTENTIALLY REACHING THE $4 PER GALLON MARK DID ENMANY JAY, JUNE, JULY AND AUGUST.  PRICES ARE SEASONAL. AS THE WEATHER STARTS TO WAR UP IN MARCH WE START TO SEE AMERICANS OUTSIDE MORE.  Reporter: DESPITE THE SUMMERTIME INCREASES AMERICANING SHOULD SEE MORE MONEY IN THE WALLET.  THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD SPENDING $277 LESS ON GASOLINE IN 2023 THAN 2022.  Reporter: HOPEFULLY THE STRAIN EASING IN THE NEW YEAR.  NBC'S KERRY SANDERS WITH THAT REPORT. PRICES FALLING AND RISING AT THE PUMP ONE OF THE MAJOR STORIES WE FOLLOW IN THE COMING YEAR.  WHAT ARE WE FOLLOWING THE PAST YEAR? JOINING NOW IS EDITOR OF POLITICO WITH THE STORIES TO EXPLAIN 2022. THERE ARE 22 STORIES FOR '22. NOT LOOKING AT ALL OF THEM. LET'S DRAW OUT SOME THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. DOGS TRIGGERED A VASECTOMY REVOLUTION.  YEAH. THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF IMPACTS OF THE DOBBS DECISION OVER THE PAST YEAR. THIS IS A MORE SURPRISING I'LL ADMIT. DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS ARE RECORDING THE RIDES OF MEN SEEKING VASECTOMIES SHOWING US THAT MEN ARE TAKING MORE CONTROL OF THEIR OWN CONTRACEPTION AS ABORTION BECOMES HARDER TO GET IN THE UNITED STATES. A REPORTER FOUND A DOCTOR RUNNING A MOBILE VASECTOMY CLINIC. IN MISSOURI CITIES TO THE REDDEST RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE AND TALKED TO MEN, DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS ABOUT THE DECISIONS TO GET A VASECTOMY AND FOUND THAT THE MAJORITY OF THEM DECIDED TO DO IT BECAUSE OF THE DOBBS DECISION.  SO INTERESTING. LIZ CHENEY WINNING THE GOP'S MANHOOD CONTEST. WE HEARD ABOUT HER THIS YEAR OF COURSE BUT IN THIS PIECE YOU LINK HER TO A BORDER CRISIS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. EXPLAIN THAT.  OH YEAH JOHN HARRIS WROTE THIS ARTICLE. COMING FROM SENATOR JOSH HAWLEY WITH THE SPEECH SAYING THAT HE BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS AN ATTACK GOING ON ON THE TRADITIONAL MASCULINE VALUES OF COURAGE AND INDEPENDENCE AND JOHN HARRIS TAKING AIM AT THAT IDEA SAYING IF YOU HOLD THE VALUES UP AS THE HIGHEST VALUES OF MASCULINITY WHO IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS DISPLAYING THEM? WHO IS STANDING UP TO TRUMP AND THE LIES ABOUT JANUARY 6? JOHN HARRIS SAID IT LOOKS LIKE LIZ CHENEY AS THE MEMBER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BEST EMBODYING THE TRADITIONAL MASCULINE VALUES.  SHE IS THE MAN IN THAT CASE. NO LOOK AT 2022 OF COURSE WOULD BE THOROUGH WITHOUT LOOKING ABROAD AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT UKRAINE AND WHAT HAPPENED IN RUSSIA. I REMEMBER THIS WEISE WITH FIONA HILL ON PUTIN AND NUKES AND CAME OUT WHEN WE WERE WORRIED THAT PUTIN MIGHT USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. FIONA HILL HAD A DIFFERENT TAKE.  THIS INTERVIEW STRUCK A CORD. PEOPLE WERE REALLY EAGER FOR EXPERT ANALYSIS AND SHE IS AN EXPERT IN EXPLAINING PUTIN'S MINDSET. HOW HE CAME TO THE POINT HE CAME TO. WHAT IS THE SORT OF PHILOSOPHY AND IDEOLOGY BEHIND THE INVASION OF UKRAINE. SHE IS SAYING THAT PUTIN WANTS TO RETURN TO THE RUIN EMPIRE. THIS IS A RETURN OF THE COUNTRIES ONCE WITHIN RUSSIA'S SPHERE OF INFLUENCE BACK TO THE SAME FEAR OF INFLUBS TODAY AND WON'T STOP. THIS IDEA THAT PUTIN WON'T GO THAT FAR. COULD NEVER INVADE THIS COUNTRY. SHE IS REALLY TAKING AIM SAYING PUTIN HAS A SINGLE MINDED GOAL AND HE WON'T STOP. HE WILL CONTINUE GOING UNTIL HE GETS THERE.  LET'S SHIFT BACK HOME NOW AND THE STORY OF THE GEORGIA SENATE RACE IS THE STORY OF HERSCHEL WALKER BUT THIS IS ABOUT WARNOCK AND NO ONE LIKE HIM IN THE SENATE PERCEIVED AS A RISING STAR WITH A BRIGHT POLITICAL FUTURE AHEAD.  OH YEAH. HE IS UNDOUBTEDLY A RISING STAR IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THEY WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHO THE DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN BENCH IS. IT IS NO SMALL FEAT AND THIS STORY WRITTEN BY MICHAEL CRUZ LOOKS AT WARNOCK'S BACKGROUND AND HE IS BOTH AN ACTIVIST PREACHER. HE IS THE PREACHER WHO PREACHES AT MARTIN LUTHER KING'S CHURCH IN ATLANTA. HAGGLING OVER DRUG PRICES AND INSULIN COSTS. ABOUT THE NEW SIDES OF THIS RISING STAR.  MICHAEL KRUSE AUTHOR OF THIS LAST STORY AND THIS ONE IS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND IN ORDER TO BE PRESIDENT HE HAD TO VANISH ONE FLORIDA GOVERNOR.  GOING TO BE HOW THE REPUBLICAN -- THE RESULTS OF THE MIDTERM ELECTION. MANY PEOPLE PERCEIVE DONALD TRUMP AS WEAK AND THEY SEE RON DESANTIS AS A RISING STAR IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO GIVE DONALD TRUMP A REAL RUN FOR THE MONEY AS THEY BOTH SEEK THE GOP NOMINATION IN 2024. SO DONALD TRUMP HAS A HISTORY OF GOING UP AGAINST FLORIDA GOVERNORS. HE SUCCEEDED IN WEAKENING YOU COULD SAY EMASCULATING JEB BUSH WITH THE COMMENTS OF LOW ENERGY JEB AND COULD HE DO IT AGAIN? IN THIS CASE MANY OF THE PEOPLE TOLD MICHAEL IN THE PIECE THAT THE SHOE COULD BE ON THE OTHER FOOT. IN THIS CASE DONALD TRUMP COULD BE THE WEAKER OF THE TWO CANDIDATES. OF COURSE ON THE OTHER HAND PEOPLE LEARNED NEVER TO DISCOUNT DONALD TRUMP.  THAT'S TRUE. MAYBE THIS IS THE END. WE DON'T KNOW YET. POLITICO'S PICKS FOR THE STORIES THAT BEST EXPLAIN 2022 IS OUT NOW. WE GOT TO 5 OF THE 22 IN THE ISSUE. CHECK THAT OUT. EDITOR ELIZABETH RALPH, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. > CONGRESSMAN-ELECT GEORGE SANTOS ADMITTED HE LIED ABOUT THE COLLEGE AND WORK HISTORY.

        "trs": "> I REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHO IS THE MAKEUP OF THIS NEW MAJORITY. YOU HEARD FROM SOME OF THEM ALREADY. YOU KNOW, MAX MILLER IN OHIO, GEORGE SANTOS IN NEW YORK, AND YOU HAD DAVID CUSS OFF FROM TENNESSEE GET REELECTED. HE INTRODUCED THEM. DO YOU REALIZE WE HAVE THE LARGEST REPUBLICAN JEWISH CAUCUS IN MORE THAN 24 YEARS? NOT BAD, HUH?  NOT BAD IF IT WERE TRUE. NOW, HERE IS THE OTHER PART OF THAT STORY, KEVIN McCARTHY HAS MORE THAN A WEEK TO TAKE BACK THOSE COMMENTS ABOUT REPUBLICAN U.S. CONGRESSMAN-ELECT GEORGE SANTOS, OR AT LEAST PUBLICLY QUESTION WHAT HE HAS ADMITTED WERE LIES UP AND DOWN HIS RESUM\u00c9, INCLUDING THAT HE'S NOT EVEN JEWISH. INSTEAD, IT HAS BEEN DEAFENING BUT UNSURPRISING SILENCE FROM KEVIN McCARTHY AND THE REST OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP. THERE'S BEEN JUST ONE INCOMING CONGRESSMAN ON THE RIGHT CALLING FOR AN INVESTIGATION INTO SANTOS. THE REPUBLICAN JEWISH COALITION HAS BARRED SANTOS FROM ATTENDING ITS FUTURE EVENTS AND WE'RE LEARNING THAT HE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION IN NEW YORK BY THE REPUBLICAN DA OF NASSAU COUNTY WHO SAYS, QUOTE, THE NUMEROUS FABRICATIONS AN INCONSISTENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH SANTOS ARE NOTHING SHORT OF STUNNING. NBC NEWS STILL HAS YET TO HEAR BACK FROM SANTOS OR McCARTHY FOR THAT MATTER, BUT SANTOS IS STILL TALKING AND TALKING. HE WENT ON FOX NEWS LAST NIGHT WHERE GUEST HOST TULSI GABBARD IN FOR TUCKER CARLSON DID A REAL INTERVIEW WITH HIM. IT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A DISASTROUS CAR WRECK OF AN APPEARANCE INSULTING THE VERY VOTERS WHO PUT HIM INTO OFFICE.  DO YOU HAVE NO SHAME IN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW YOU'RE ASKING TO TRUST YOU TO GO AND BE THEIR VOICE FOR THEM, THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR KIDS IN WASHINGTON?  TULSI, I CAN SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS AND THE PARTY. I CAN SIT DOWN AND EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT YOU CAN DO IN PRIVATE IN EQUITY IN CAPITAL VIA SERVICING LIMITED PARTNERS AND GENERAL PARTNERS AND WE CAN HAVE THIS DISCUSSION THAT'S GOING TO GO WAY ABOVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S HEAD BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT I CAMPAIGNED ON. I CAMPAIGNED ON DELIVERING RESULTS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  WOW. YOU JUST HIGHLIGHTED MY CONCERN, THE PEOPLE AT CONCERN HAVE, YOU'RE SAYING THAT THIS DISCUSSION WILL GO WAY ABOVE THE HEADS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BASICALLY INSULTING THEIR INTELLIGENCE.  CALLING YOUR OWN VOTERS STUPID IS NOT A GOOD POLITICAL STRATEGY. JOINING OUR CONVERSATION POLITICAL STRATEGIST AND MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR MATT DOWD IS HERE, KATTY STILL WITH US. MATT, THIS FEELS LIKE A STORY NOT ABOUT THIS, YOU KNOW, YAHOO CONGRESSMAN-ELECT BUT ABOUT KEVIN McCARTHY AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WHAT STANDS OUT? WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING WITH THIS?  WELL, I'M GLAD YOU SAID THAT, NICOLLE, BECAUSE I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS A BROADER INDICTMENT OF IT'S NOT JUST GEORGE SANTOS WHO I WAS THINKING TODAY IS THE ONLY PERSON I KNOW WHO WOULD WRITE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND THE BOOK STORES WOULD HAVE TO PUT IT IN THE FICTION SECTION THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY A BIOGRAPHY GOT PUT IN THE FICTION SECTION. I MEAN, TO ME THIS IS SUCH AN INDICTMENT AND IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME WE ARE AT THIS WHERE KEVIN McCARTHY ISN'T SAYING ANYTHING AT ALL, NOT A WORD. AND MOST REPUBLICANS ARE KEEPING QUIET IN THE MIDST OF THIS. THEY GAVE DONALD TRUMP LAST COUNT I KNOW HE LIED 30,000 TIMES AS PRESIDENT IN THE COURSE OF THIS THEY GAVE HIM A PASS EVERY TIME. TO ME THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF OUR POLITICS WHERE A PARTY NO LONGER BELIEVES INTEGRITY IS INTEGRAL TO BEING A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS BECAUSE IF YOU ARE UNWILLING AS A PERSON, GEORGE SANTOS, TO SELF-REGULATE, RIGHT, TO SELF-REGULATE AND SAY I SCREWED UP, I SHOULDN'T BE SERVING, AND DO THE RIGHT THING AND RESIGN OR NOT ACCEDE TO THE OFFICE, SO YOU HAVE THAT PROBLEM, THEN YOU HAVE THE PROBLEM OF A POLITICAL PARTY WHO HAS NO DESIRE, IT SEEMS RIGHT NOW, WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE COMING DAYS, BUT IT SEEMS RIGHT NOW TO HOLD GEORGE SANTOS OR ANY MEMBER OF THEIR POLITICAL PARTY ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANYTHING. FOR ANYTHING. AND SO WE ARE IN A TIME WHEN WE USED TO COUNT ON LEADERS TO SORT OF DO SELF-EXAMINATION, SELF-REGULATE, APOLOGIZE, DO THE RIGHT THING, BUT THEN SOMETIMES WE HAVE HAD TO RESORT TO A POLITICAL PARTY WHO WOULD ACTUALLY FORCE A LEADER TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN THE COURSE OF THIS. TODAY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DOESN'T HAVE REPRESENTATIVES WHO WILL DO THE RIGHT THING AND SELF-REGULATE AND THEY DON'T HAVE A POLITICAL PARTY THAT WILL ACTUALLY REGULATE AND HOLD THEIR MEMBERS ACCOUNTABLE. SO YOU'RE RIGHT, THIS IS A BROADER INDICTMENT, MORE SO THAN OVER THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY AS CONGRESSMAN COMING JANUARY 3rd.  YEAH, I MEAN, BECAUSE THE STORY IS SO EASY TO UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, A LYING LIAR LIES ABOUT EVERYTHING INCLUDING HIS FABRICATING HIS GRANDPARENTS' HISTORY, LYING ABOUT HIS RELIGION. YOU CAN STOP THERE BECAUSE IT'S ENOUGH. IT'S, OH, MY GOD, BUT IT REALLY IS, MATT DOWD, A STORY OF LIKE ANOTHER CHAPTER, YOU KNOW, CHAPTER 38 OF THE ROT ON THE RIGHT. AND I WISH I DIDN'T REMEMBER A DIFFERENT VERSION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE THEN IT WOULDN'T BE A GUT PUNCH EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU SEE HOW FAR THEY'VE FALLEN. THIS IS THAT AGAIN, A REMINDER THAT THEY DON'T STAND FOR NOTHING, THIS HE STAND FOR THIS. THEY STAND FOR SOMEONE WHO IS SO FOOLISH AND SO CORRUPT THAT HE WOULD GET KICKED OUT OF ANY SCHOOL, HE WOULD GET KICKED OFF ANY SPORTS TEAM, HE WOULD GET KICKED OUT OF ANY NORMAL WORKPLACE, BUT HE CAN REMAIN AND THRIVE IN THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS.  WELL, YOU'RE RIGHT AND THAT'S BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM IS DEPENDENT ON THESE PEOPLE HAVING SOME SENSE OF INTEGRITY FOR ONE FOR THEM TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND, TWO, IF THEY WON'T THEN THE POLITICAL PARTY WILL DO THE RIGHT THING. I BELIEVE, I FIRMLY BELIEVE, MAYBE THIS IS MY HOPE AND OPTIMISM AND BELIEF THAT HIS TENURE IN THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE A SHORT ONE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, NOT BECAUSE THE REPUBLICANS WILL HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE, BECAUSE HOW DO THEY SUSTAIN THIS? THINK ABOUT THIS, NICOLLE, WHAT COMMITTEE DO THEY PUT THIS GUY ON THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY OF THE WEEK THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM? THEY CAN'T PUT HIM ON FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE BECAUSE THIS GUY MAKES UP STUFF. THEY CAN'T PUT HIM ON EDUCATION, IS THAT BHAU WANT TEACHING OUR CHILDREN? I MEAN, YOU LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE COMMITTEE, IT'S ANOTHER HEADACHE, BUT IT GOES TO SOMETHING I THINK YOU ARE AIMING AT WHICH IS WE HAVE A POLITICAL PARTY TODAY, THE REPUBLICANS, WHOSE DRIVE TO GET POWER KNOWS NO ENDS, I MEAN, KNOWS NO MEANS THAT THEY WON'T AGREE TO. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. THEY AGREED TO ALL THE STUFF THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT THEY DIDN'T LIKE ABOUT DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE IT MEANT POWER. THEY'VE AGREED TO ALL THE THINGS ABOUT U.S. SENATORS, GOVERNOR CANDIDATES, SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDATES WHO WERE BIZARRE AT THE LEAST, CORRUPT AT THE MOST, THEY ACCEDED TO ALL OF THAT IN THEIR POLITICAL PARTY IN THE MIDST OF THIS. SO I THINK IT'S JUST TELLING, IT'S TELLING THE MOMENT WE'RE IN THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NO LONGER BELIEVES IN TRUTH TELLING, NO LONGER BELIEVES IN INTEGRITY. WHAT THEY FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE TO IS ACCESS TO POWER.  KATTY, THE MOST INTERESTING TWIST HERE, THOUGH, IS THAT IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR IT'S WORKING. IT'S NOT EVEN CLEAR THEY'RE GAINING POWER WITH THIS AS THEIR BRAND.  I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU MEAN BY GAINING POWER, YOU KNOW, CLEARLY, YES, THEY DIDN'T DO AS WELL IN 2022 AS THEY SHOULD HAVE DONE AS THEY WERE PREDICTED TO DO. HERSCHEL WALKER WHO YOU MIGHT KIND OF PUT IN THE SAME VEIN AS SOMEBODY WHO LIED ABOUT ISSUES OR SAID ONE THING ABOUT ISSUES AND ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING ELSE WITH HIS LIFE REPORTEDLY, ON THE ISSUE OF ABORTION HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY MANAGE TO GET ELECTED, BUT THEY'RE SEEING POWER IN A VERY NARROW SENSE. SO FOR KEVIN McCARTHY IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT GETTING TO THAT 218. IF IT'S 219 THAT'S GREAT, IF IT'S 220 THAT'S EVEN BETTER, BUT HE'S NOT EXPECTING TO GET TO 230 AND IN A WAY THAT'S REPRESENTATIVE OF WHERE AMERICAN POLITICS WRIT LARGE IS AT THE MOMENT. IT'S ON STUFF A KNIFE EDGE THAT YOU'RE FIGHTING OVER TINY SLIVERS OF GROUND AND THAT'S ALL -- THAT'S ALL THE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO DO IS WIN VERY, VERY SMALL MARGINS AND HOPE THAT THAT IS JUST GOING TO BE ENOUGH. AND THEY WILL DO ANYTHING IT TAKES IN THE CASE OF HERSCHEL WALKER OR IN THE CASE OF SANTOS, MATT GAETZ YOU COULD PUT IN THE SAME BRACKET TO GET THERE.  IT'S AMAZING. ALL RIGHT. MATT AND KATTY ARE STICKING AROUND. > UP NEXT FOR US, REPUBLICANS ALSO APPEAR TO BE IGNORING LESSONS FROM NOVEMBER, THE REJECTION BY VOTERS, INCLUDING THEIR OWN VOTERS, OF EXTREMISM IN THE REPUBLICAN RANKS.

MEANING MEALS, HOTELS AND REFUNDS FOR CANCELED FLIGHTS. > WELCOME BACK TO \"MORNING JOE.\" WE'RE IN OUR SECOND HOUR NOW. IT'S WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 28th. I'M JONATHAN LEMIRE ALONGSIDE THE BBC'S KATTY KAY AS WELL AS NBC, AND MSNBC NEWS AFFAIRS ANALYST JOHN HEILEMANN AND JOE AND MIKA HAVE THE MORNING OFF. AND CHAOS CONTINUING AT AIRPORTS NATIONWIDE, THOUSANDS OF FLIGHTS CANCELED IN THE WAKE OF A HISTORIC STORM. OVERWHELMING MAJORITY COMING FROM JUST ONE AIRLINE. NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT BLAYNE ALEXANDER HAS MORE.  Reporter: AT AIRPORT AFTER ART --  NOW I KNOW WHY THERE'S A LINE. MY FLIGHT WAS CANCELED.  Reporter: THIS IS THE PICTURE OF AN UNPRECEDENTED TRAVEL NIGHTMARE.  HERE AT THE AIRPORT ALL DAY.  Reporter: WITH THOUSANDS OF FLIGHTS CANCELED AGAIN MORE THAN 80% OF THEM DUE TO ONE AIRLINE. WHILE MAJOR CARRIERS LIGS DELTA, JETBLUE AND AMERICAN TOGETHER HAD FEWER THAN 200 CANCELLATIONS, SOUTHWEST HAD TO CANCEL MORE THAN 2,600 FLIGHTS.  LOOK AT THIS MESS. EVERYBODY OVER WHOER IS PISSED.  I WENT TO OTHER -- AIRLINES, AND EVERYBODY'S BOOKED UP. EVERYBODY'S BOOKED. I CAN'T GET OUT.  Reporter: SOUTHWEST CEO RELEASING THIS STATEMENT --  WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO RETURN TO A NORMAL OPERATION, AND, PLEASE, ALSO HEAR THAT I'M TRULY SORRY. LARGE NUMBERS OF SCHEDULED FLIGHTS SIMULTANEOUSLY FROZE AS RECORD-BITTER COLD BROUGHT CHALLENGES FOR ALL AIRLINES.  Reporter: BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION IS CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT IT CALLS AN UNACCEPTABLE RATE OF CANCELLATIONS AND LOOKING INTO WHETHER THESE WERE WITHIN THE AIRLINE'S CONTROL AND SOUTHWEST ACKNOWLEDGED THE SITUATION AS UNACCEPTABLE. IN PART BECAUSE WINTER WEATHER IMPACTED TWO MAJOR HUBS, BUT SOUTHWEST POINTS TO THE AIRLINE USING OUT OF DATE TECHNOLOGY TO SCHEDULE CREWS.  WE'VE HAD FLIGHT ATTENDANTS WAITING ON HOLD FOR 17 HOURS TO GET IN TOUCH WITH SCHEDULES. IT'S DEPLORABLE.  Reporter: ONE RIPPLE EFFECT COMPOUNDING THE CHAOS, BAGGAGE PILING UP.  TRAVELERS WHO MANAGE TO CATCH A SOUTHWEST FLIGHT HAVE ANOTHER CHALLENGE UPON ARRIVAL OF EPIC PROPORTIONS, SIFTING THROUGH A SEA OF LUGGAGE HERE AT MIDWAY TO MAYBE FIND THEIR BAGS.  WE'VE BEEN IN LINE FOR TWO HOURS. CHECKING ALL THE OTHER FLIGHTS.  Reporter: THIS COUPLE STARTED THEIR JOURNEY TRYING TO GET HOME TO LAS VEGAS AND TO THEIR 2-YEAR-OLD SON AFTER WAITING FOUR HOURS AT NEW YORK'S LaGUARDIA AIRPORT.  SOME LADY WALKED THROUGH WITH SOUTHWEST SAID, HEY, 19 TICKETS TO GET TO ATLANTA ON A BUS. ANYBODY WANT TO GO ON A BUS RIDE?  13-HOUR BUS RIDE TO GET TO ATLANTA.  Reporter: THEY HOPPED ON HOPING FOR BETTER FLIGHT OPTIONS IN A DIFFERENT CITY ONLY TO FIND ANOTHER LINE AND ANOTHER FRUSTRATING WAIT.  IN THE SAME SITUATION. WE'RE NOT SPECIAL. JUST TRYING TO GET HOME.  NBC'S BLAYNE ALEXANDER WITH THAT REPORT. I ALMOST DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN, KATTY. PEOPLE STRANDED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. LUGGAGE ABANDONED. WHO KNOWS WHEN YOU'LL SEE IT AGAIN AND THEN THAT POOR COUPLE TAKING A BUS TOS IT ATLANTA AND HAVING THE SAME EXPERIENCE ALL OVER AGAIN. JUST STUCK THERE. NO WAY TO GET HOME?  AND TRAVEL IS MISERABLE ANYWAY. TO HAVE THIS HIT THEM. I JUST DON'T THINK SOUTHWEST HAS REALLY ANSWERED THE QUESTION WE'VE THEY'VE BEEN HIT AND OTHER AIRLINES WASN'T. WEATHER BAD FOR EVERYBODY, HOLIDAYS TOUGH FOR EVERYBODY YET NOT HEARING SAME FROM AMERICAN, DELTA, UNITED. SPIRIT SURVIVED ALL OF THIS, THEY SEEMED TO HAVE SURVIVED ALL THIS. THE ONLY INTERESTING THING IN THE REPORT WAS THAT TECHNOLOGY IS OLD AT SOUTH WEST AND THERE MIST BE SOMETHING ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY THEY ARE USING TO BOOK PEOPLE AND REBOOK THEM FROM CANCELED FLIGHTS, MEANS THEY ARE GETTING MORE MESSED UP THAN THE OTHER AIRLINES. HOPE BUTTIGIEG GETS TO THE BOTTOM. MISERABLE FOR ANYBODY FLYING AT THE MOMENT. > AND LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY, REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP STILL SILENT WHAT IT WILL DO ABOUT GEORGE SANTOS. LYING ABOUT EDUCATION, WORK HISTORY AND EVEN HIS PERSONAL LIFE. EVEN WITHOUT A WORD FROM LEADERSHIP MANY ON THE RIGHT ARE CALLING FOR A RESPONSE THEMSELVES. THE REPUBLICAN JEWISH FOUNDATION, WRITING HE DECEIVED US AND MISREPRESENTED HIS HERITAGE. IN PUBLIC COMMENTS AND TO US PERSONALLY, HE PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED TO BE JEWISH. FELLOW REPUBLICAN NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN-ELECT VETERAN NICK LALOTA RESPONDED TO THE CONTROVERSY ON TWITTER WRITING IN PART, \"AS A NAVY MAN WHO CAMPAIGNED ON RESTORES ACCOUNTABILITY AND INTEGRITY TO THE OUR GOVERNMENT I BELIEVE A FULL INVESTIGATION BY THE HOUSE ETHICS COMMITTEE AND IF NECESSARY LAW ENFORCEMENT REQUIRED,\" AND ANOTHER COMMITTEE CHAIR SAID IN A STATEMENT YESTERDAY, \"DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED IN MR. SANTOS AND EXPECTED MORE THAN JUST A BLANKET APOLOGY. THE DAMAGE HIS LIES CAUSED TO MANY PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE IMPACTED BY THE HOLOCAUST ARE PROFOUND.\" HOWEVER, HE STOPPED SHORT OF CALLING FOR SANTOS TO RESIGN. BUT TRUMP ADVISER JASON MILLER WENT ALL THE WAY IN A SOCIAL MEDIA POST WRITING SIMPLY, \"GET RID OF THIS LOSER.\" HMM. ECHOING HIS FORMER BOSS. AND FOX NEWS YESTERDAY IN AN INTERVIEW WITH FILL-IN HOST TULSI GABBARD, FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN, WHO CALLED HIM OUT FOR ALL OF THOSE LIES.  WHAT DOES THE WORD \"INTEGRITY\" MEAN TO YOU?  WELL, TULSI, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. YOU KNOW, TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, INTEGRITY IS VERY IMPORTANT, AND LIKE I SAID TO THE \"NEW YORK POST,\" EMBELLISHMENT --  WHAT DOES IT MEAN, THOUGH? BECAUSE THE MEANING OF THE WORD ACTUALLY MATTERS IN PRACTICE.  OF COURSE. IT MEANS TO CARRY YOURSELF IN AN HONORABLE WAY, AND I MADE A MISTAKE, AND I THINK HUMANS ARE FLAWED AND WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES, TULSI.  THE THING IS, CONGRESSMAN-ELECT, INTEGRITY MEANS, YES, CARRYING YOURSELF WITH HONOR, BUT IT MEANS TELLING THE TRUTH, BEING A PERSON OF INTEGRITY AND IF I WERE ONE OF THOSE IN NEW YORK'S 3rd DISTRICT RIGHT NOW, NOW THAT THE ELECTION IS OVER AND I'M FINDING OUT ALL OF THESE LIES YOU'VE TOLD. NOT JUST ONE LIE OR EMBELLISHMENT, THESE ARE BLATANT LIES. MY QUESTION IS, DO YOU HAVE NO SHAME? DO YOU HAVE NO SHAME IN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW YOU'RE ASKING TO TRUST YOU TO GO AND BE THEIR VOICE FOR THEM, THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR KIDS IN WASHINGTON?  TULSI, I CAN SAY THE SAME THING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS AND THE PARTY. LOOK AT JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN'S BEEN LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR 40 YEARS. HE IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. DEMOCRATS ARE RESOUNDLY SUPPORT HIM, DO THEY HAVE NO SHAME?  YEAH. LAST I LOOKED UP WHAT IT WAS TO BE A SERIAL LIAR ON THIS SCALE, SAYS YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NARCISSISTIC PERSONALITY DISORDER. LOOKS WHAT GEORGE SANTOS MIGHT HAVE, BUT DOESN'T LIKE LIKE HE'LL APOLOGIZE ADMITTING TO EMBELLISHES HIS RESUME. NBC NEWS REACHED OUT TO HIM FOR A STATEMENT, PROMPTING A SPECIAL ELECTION IF FORCED TO RESIGN AND A SPECIAL ELECTION HE FLIPPED AND RISKY FOR THE REPUBLICAN'S THIN MAJORITY AND GEORGE SANTOS PLEDGED TO VOTE FOR KEVIN McCARTHY AND KNOWS WHERE HIS BREAD IS BUTTERED. SOUNDS TO ME LIKE HE'S GETTING AWAY WITH IT BUT SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM YOU CAN LIE IN FRONT OF CONGRESS, NOBODY FOUND OUT IN THE PROCESS OF THE ELECTION CAMPAIGN. SHOULD HAVE DONE IT IN OPPOSITION RESEARCH, AND THERE IS NO RECOURSE. THE VOTERS HAVE PUT IN THERE TWO YEARS, LOOKS LIKE HE CAN BE THERE TWO YEARS?  IN DANGER RIGHT AWAY BUT WILL TAKE HIS SEAT, AND REPUBLICANS A LOT OF WHATABISM? EMBELLISH PARTS OF THE RESUME, NO. THAT COMPARISON DOESN'T FLY. SO MUCH -- STILL SO MUCH WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT SANTOS. ALSO SUGGESTED WHEN HE LIVED IN FLORIDA FOUR EMPLOYEES KILLED AT THE ORLANDO, THE PULSE NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING. NO IDEA IN THAT'S TRUE. HE'S SUPPLIED NO EVIDENCE OF THAT AND NOTE, KATTY, YOU READ THE RJC STATEMENT. MAZE CLEAR, SANTOS IS NOT WELCOME TO ATTEND ANY OF THEIR EVENTS GOING FORWARD. CERTAINLY A CLEAN BREAK THEY ARE TRYING TO ESTABLISH. JOHN HEILEMANN, WEIGH IN.  CAN WE NOT EXPECT EVEN THIS EMBELLISHMENT. THE GUY, NOT REFUTED, HE FABRICATED, SAID HE KNEW EMBELLISHED.  WHY?  ACCUSED OF BEING FABULOUSISM AND MAKING UP THINGS ON THE RESUME AND WANTS TO CHARACTERIZE IT AS EMBELLISHMENT. THAT'S IF YOU CALL YOURSELF AN ASSISTANT DIRECTOR AND TURNS OUT ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR. OKAY, WELL, ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, AH, EMBELLISHMENT. THIS GUY MADE UP WORKING FOR COMPANIES NEVER WORKED FOR, ASSOCIATIONS HE NEVER HAD. HIS RESUME MOSTLY A WORK OF FICTION ON THE BASIS WHAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND I THINK TO KATTY'S POINT, THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY.  A LITTLE WAYS AWAY, TWO YEARS. RE-ELECTION RACE STARTS EARLY FOR THIS GUY AND AS YOU SAID, JON, IN DANGER RIGHT OFF THE BAT. PRIMARY TO PROBABLY A STIFF DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT, BUT ALSO SOMEONE WHO'S THIS TOPOLOGICAL. TENDS TO, AS WE'VE SEEN ALREADY, TURNING HIMSELF INTO A VICTIM. WELL, ALREADY ANSWERED THESE QUESTIONS AND I -- ALREADY MADE THIS -- EVERYBODY DOES THIS. LIFE IS HARD AND YOU WILL MAKE MISTAKES. DUDE, THAT IS A GUY EXHIBITING INSTABILITY IN HIS PSYCHE AND ALTHOUGH HE MAY GET INTO OFFICE, SOME OF THE PERSONALITY TRAITS COMING OUT HERE SUGGEST HE MAY HAVE OTHER ROCKY EXPERIENCES AHEAD FOR HIMSELF.  CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. ALSO SHOULDN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT, OF COURSE, THESE ARE VOTERS IN NEW YORK STATE WHO THOUGHT THEY WERE ELECTING SOMEONE ON THE BASIS OF ONE SET OF FACTS, AND, IN FACT, VERY FEW OF THEM ENDED UP BEING TRUE. EVEN THE MATTER OF HIS OWN RELIGIOUS FAITH. BRING IN FOLKS TO JOIN IN THIS CONVERSATION. CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT FOR THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" PETER BAKER IS HERE AS WELL AS FORMER AIDE TO HOUSE SPEAKERS PAUL RYAN AND JOHN BOEHNER. WELCOME TO YOU BOTH. YOU KNOW REPUBLICANS AND THE HOUSE. GIVE YOUR ANALYSIS WHAT YOU'VE SEEN SO FAR FROM CONGRESSMAN-ELECT SANTOS AND ALSO THE SILENCE FROM GOP LEADERSHIP.  YEAH. I WOULDN'T ACTUALLY BE SO SURE HE'S GOING TO MAKE IT TWO YEARS. YOU TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THE MORE OUTLANDISH THINGS ON HIS BIO. ONE I'M I'M REALLY FOCUSED ON. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. YOU HAVE TO FILE THAT WHEN YOU RUN FOR OFFICE. IF HE RAN BEFORE, HE RAN TWO YEARS AGO FILING NO ACCOUNTS OR ASSETS WORTH MORE THAN $5,000. THIS TIME AROUND APPARENTLY WORTH $11 MILLION OR $12 MILLION. WHERE DID THAT COME FROM? FILING A FALSE FINANCIAL -- THAT'S A CRIME. LAW ENFORCEMENT MAY LOOK AT THIS AND APPARENTLY LOANED HIS COMMITTEE $700,000 FROM HIMSELF. WHERE DID HE GE$$700,000? A LOT OF QUESTIONS WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO THE BOTTOM OF. HOUSE ETHICS WILL LOOK AT THIS. WE HAVEN'T EXPELLED -- ONLY TWO PEOPLE I THINK SINCE THE CIVIL WAR, BUT THAT'S CERTAINLY ON THE TABLE. USUALLY PEOPLE ARE KIND OF TALKED INTO RESIGNING. REALIZE THAT WRITING'S ON THE WALL, IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK OUT WELL FOR THEM, BUT I THINK ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE ON THE TABLE FOR HIM. THIS IS A WILD SITUATION.  PETER, HE MERRICK AS GOOD POINT. MAY HAVE BEEN LACK OF VETTING FOR SANTOS BEFORE THE ELECTION, BUT CERTAINLY IT'S COMING NOW. BUT I ALSO WAS STRUCK BY HOW HE SEEMS TO BE IN MANY WAYS A PERFECT ENCAPSULATION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY UNDER DONALD TRUMP AND THE TRUMP ERA. YOU AND I, OF COURSE, COVERED IT FOR YEARS AND STILL ARE. SEEMS LIKE LIES HAS HAD VERY FEW CONSEQUENCES FOR TRUMP WHILE IN OFFICE. FOR OTHER REPUBLICANS TRYING TO EMULATE HIM, AND SANTOS IS NOW THE LATEST EXAMPLE, INCLUDING, CONTINUING THE PARALLEL, REPUBLICANS IN LEADERSHIP WHO KNOW BETTER, WHO COULD CALL OUT THE BAD BEHAVIOR, JUST LIKE THEY DID WITH TRUMP, THEY'RE HOLDING THEIR TONGUES.  YEAH. WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IS THAT IF YOU ARE BRAZEN FLUFF TO SIMPLY IGNORE OR DEFY PUBLIC PRESSURE, IF YOU DON'T GIVE IN TO THE NATURE OF, YOU KNOW, THE TRADITIONAL YOU KNOW, WASHINGTON VIEW OF THINGS, WHICH IS WHEN EVERYBODY COMES AFTER YOU, SAY, OKAY. WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD STEP DOWN, THAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SURVIVE. PEOPLE, IN FACT, WON'T CALM YOU OUT. THAT PEOPLE, IN FACT, WON'T ACTUALLY PULL THE TRIGGER TO DO SOMETHING TOS FOR YOU TO RESIGN, NOT TAKE YOUR SEAT. BRAZENNESS IS THE CORE OF THE REALM IN RECENT YEARS. WE'LL SEE. A GOOD POINT ABOUT FINANCES NOW BUT ALSO A POINT THAT THERE'S NOT A LOT OF HISTORY OF CONGRESS EXPELLING ITS OWN MEMBERS. I THINK THERE IS, YOU KNOW, FOR ALL THE WHATABOU ITISM, MAKING RESUME ENHANCEMENT DISQUALIFYING. THERE IS ENOUGH OF THAT IT ON BOTH SIDES, LET'S NOT GO DOWN THE ROAD. THIS IS A MORE EXTREME VERSION OF IT. YOU DON'T NORMALLY SEE IT AS PATHOLOGICALLY EXPANSIVE AS THIS PARTICULAR CASE AND WHAT MAKES THIS SO DIFFERENT.  PATHOLOGICAL, A FEW TIMES MENTIONED THIS MORNING. APPROPRIATELY SO. STAYING IN THE POLITICAL WORLD. TIME FOR A MUST-REOP-EDS. MARK THIESSEN ENDS EACH YEAR WITH HIS LIST OF THE TEN BEST AND WORST THINGS THE SITTING PRESIDENT DID OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. YESTERDAY HE POSTED HIS LIST OF THE TEN BEST THINGS HE SAYS BIDEN DID IN 2022. HIS LIST OF TEN WORST THINGS COMES OUT LATER TODAY, BUT FOCUS ON THE BEST. READ THROUGH THEM. 10, ACTED TO PREVENT A CRIPPLING NATIONAL RAIL STRIKE. 9, SENDING B-52s TO AUSTRALIA TO COUNTER CHINA. 8, LAUNCHED A FULL-COURT PRESS AGAINST CHINA'S DOMESTIC SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY. 7, BIDEN SIGNED THE FIRST BIPARTISAN GUN LEGISLATION IN DECADES. 6, HE SECURED EXTRADITION OF THE TERRORIST CHARGE WITH BOMBING PAN AM FLIGHT 103 WHICH KILLED 190 AMERICANS. 5, HE KEPT IRAN'S ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS LIST OF TERRORISTS, 4, JOINING NATO. 3, BIDEN KILLED AL QAEDA LEADER, 2, DEFENSE IN TAIWAN AND 1, SAVED UKRAINE. ALSO NOTES BIDEN TURNED IN FIRST -- THE BEST FIRST-TERM PERFORMANCE OF ANY PRESIDENT SINCE JOHN F. KENNEDY EXCEPT FOR GEORGE W. BUSH AFTER THE 9/11 ATTACK. IMPRESSIVE ACHIEVEMENT. SO JOHN HEILEMANN, A LIST FOCUSED ON MATTERS AT HOME AND ABROAD. WHAT DID YOU MAKE OF THAT LIST OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS?  LOOK, MARK THIESSEN, MOST VIEWERS KNOW THIS. A VERY CONSERVATIVE GUY. TO SEE THE FACT THAT A CONSERVATIVE OUT THERE, SOMEONE WITH GENUINE CONSERVATISM, USED TO BE CONSIDERED FAR RIGHT BEFORE WE HAD MAGA REPUBLICANS COULD COME UP WITH TEN THINGS. THESE ARE NOT SMALL THINGS. MARK THIESSEN KNOCKED OFF TEN. MY GUESS TOP TEN HAS A FEW THAT DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT SIGNIFICANT AND SOME OF BIG DEALS. TEN COMING IN HE DIDN'T LIKE. ALL GOOD. WAIT AND HEAR WHAT HE HAS TO SAY. RAISED THE QUESTION TO ME, RAISES AN ISSUE, WHICH IS JOE BIDEN WANTS IT TO HAVE BIPARTISAN SUCCESS. WANTED TO BASICALLY SAY, I GOT THINGS DONE. REPUBLICANS COULD AGREE WITH. HE'S BEEN -- ON BOTH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN FRONT, HE'S, HE CLAIMS TO HAVE DONE 134 THINGS REPUBLICANS SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET BEHIND IN ACTING IN GOOD FAITH. IS THE MARK THIESSEN LIST NOT KIND OF THE PROOF IN THE PUDDING IN WAYS? JOE BIDEN COULD POINT TA THAT, NOT ELECTED REPUBLICAN BUT GENUINE CONSERVATIVE LIKE MARK THESEN, FOREIGN POLICY, LOOK AT THIS LIST. THINGS EVERY TRUE PRINCIPLE CONSERVATIVE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET BEHIND.  YEAH. IT WAS NOTABLE. YOU KNOW HE'S A CONSERVATIVE. A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE THINGS ACTUALLY AREN'T ON THE LIST THAT WERE BIPARTISAN. INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, C.H.I.P.S BILL, A STRETCH ACTUALLY GETTING A LOT DONE. LOOK, YOU KNOW THIS. INCENTIVES THERE ARE NOT FOR BIPARTISANSHIP ANYMORE. INCENTIVES THERE TO TEAR DOWN THE OTHER PARTY. WE'RE DEFINED BY NEGATIVE PATERSONSHIP AND CONSISTENT AND CAN BE PROUD WA JOE BIDEN DID. UKRAINE ALONE COULD BE THE TOTAL LIST. ALL THINGS DONE IN TERMS OF BUILDING INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCES, STAVING OFF RUSSIA. THESE ARE THINGS CONSERVATIVES TALKED ABOUT FOR A VERY LONG TIME, AND I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WILLING TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THOSE THINGS. IT'S NOT A TOTALLY LOST TWO YEARS, IF YOU'RE REPUBLICANS, OPEN YOUR EYES TO IT, THAT IS.  PETER BAKER, NOT SURPRISING THIESSEN LEFT OFF SOME OF THE DOMESTIC DEMOCRATIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS. RECONCILIATION PACKAGE MENTIONED JOE SIGNED OFF, CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. FOCUS ON FOREIGN POLICY. UKRAINE AND A COUPLE ON CHINA. UNDOUBTEDLY SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT AND SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AHEAD IN 2023, BOTH UKRAINE AND CHINA?  YOU'RE RIGHT.  AND THE BEIJING.  CONSERVATIVE, AGREE WITH LIBERALS PUT A DIFFERENT LIST TOGETHER. RIGHT? CLIMATE CHANGE, SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, CODIFICATION, OTHER THINGS PROBABLY ON A DEMOCRATS' LIST NOT ON THIESSEN'S LIST. FINE. ON FOREIGN POLICY. YOU'RE RIGHT. THE UKRAINE THING HE DOESN'T GET A LOT OF PUBLIC CREDIT FOR IT, BECAUSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE. IN A BIPARTISAN MOMENT, BRANDON SAID, REPUBLICANS SUPPORTED ALL EXPENDITURES OF AMERICAN TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO PAY FOR ARMS FOR UKRAINIANS AND AREA TWO PARTIES HAVE LARGELY COME TOGETHER. DOESN'T KNEE MONTH CRITICISM OF SOME OF THE WAY THING, HANDLED BUT BROADLY SPEAKING, A BIPARTISAN CONSENSUS, TAKE AWAY THE PUTIN OF THE FAR RIGHT. GONE RELATIVELY WELL FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN. BOTH SUPPORTING AND SAVING TO USE MARK THIESSEN'S WORD, UKRAINE SAME TIME NOT EXPANDING OR ESCALATING THE WAR TO THE POINT WE ARE DIRECTLY INVOLVED OURSELVES. A HIGH PRIORITY FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN. HE DOESN'T WANT THIS TO BECOME AN AMERICAN WAR IN A DIRECT SENSE. WE DON'T KNOW NEXT YEAR WILL BRING THAT REGARD. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT WILL CONTINUE. GOING INTO THE NEW YEAR, THE CHALLENGEANCE HOW TO ENJOY SUCCESSES ON THE GROUND WITHOUT TAKING IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL. PUTIN USING A NUCLEAR WEAPON, WITHOUT NATO DRAGGED IN IN SOME DIRECT COMBAT KIND OF WAY, AND WE HAVE, NO GUARANTEE IT WILL CONTINUE TO GO WELL IN THAT REGARD, BUT THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY I THINK FOR THE FOREIGN POLICY TEAM AT THE WHITE HOUSE.  YEAH. CHALLENGE FOR ALLIES, PARTLY COHESION AND PARTLY SUPPLIES. KEEP AN EYE ON THEIR OWN STOCKS, WHICH ARE NOT LIMITLESS EITHER. ANOTHER ONE PRESIDENT BIDEN WILL ENJOY READING WHILE ON VACATION. JONAH GOLDBERG, A NEW PIECE IN THE \"L.A. TIMES\" TITLED \"CLOSING OUT 2022,\" SADDEST FIGURE IN POST-PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS WRITES IN PART, CONTRAST WITH NIXON'S POST-PRESIDENCY IS POIGNANT. NIXON AND EXILE WROTE TEN BOOKS, QUITE SERIOUS INCLUDING MEMOIRS. CLAWED BACK A REPUTATION AS A WISE MAN WHO DISPENSED ADVICE TO PRESIDENTS, BUT THAT'S NOT THE POIGNANT PART. NIXON SURROUNDED WITH A LOVING FAMILY. LIFELONG FRIENDS AND LOYAL AIDES WHO GAVE HIM THE SORT OF STUFF POLITICS COULDN'T. NIXON IN EXILE ENJOYED SUPPORT OF FRIENDS AND OF HIS ENEMIES. NIXON'S STRUGGLE COMPLICATED BECAUSE HE WAS COMPLICATED. TRUMP'S STRUGGLE IS SIMPLE, BECAUSE HE IS SIMPLE. ALL HE IS, IS APPETITE FOR FAME, POWER, SEX, ADMIRATION. SHORT OF ANY INTERIOR LIFE AND UNENCUMBERED BY EXTERIOR ATTACHMENTS WE DON'TNEED SECRET TAPES TO KNOW TRUMP BECAUSE THE REAL TRUMP IS ALWAYS ON DISPLAY WITH EYES TO SEE HIM AND FINALLY THE SIGHT IS BECOMING WEARYING EVEN FOR HIS FANS -- OUCH -- UP THERE WITH THAT PIECE REAL GOING FOR TRUMP IN A WAY PERSONAL AND ACCURATE. PAINTING A VERY LONELY, SAD FIGURE DOWN IN MAR-A-LAGO WHO'S WEALTH HAS JUST SHRUNK.  YEAH. AND LOOK, JONAH GOLDBERG COMING FROM A MORE POSITION OF OPINION THAN REPORTING, FROM THE PIECE IN THE \"NEW YORK\" MAGAZINE. OLIVIA'S PIECE PAINTS A PICTURE AND JONAH MAKES THE, THE POINT, HISTORICAL POINT RELATIVE TO NIXON AND PETER BAKER, SOMEONE WHO JUST ALONG WITH YOUR WIFE WROTE A VERY IMPORTANT BOOK ABOUT TRUMP'S FOUR YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT JUST CAME OUT LAST YEAR. I ADVISE EVERYBODY WHO WANTS A FULL 360 VIEW OF TRUMP'S TIME IN OFFICE, BUY PETER'S BOOK. IT IS AN INTERESTING COMPARISON WITH NIXON. RIGHT? A PERIOD WHEN NIXON WAS PATHETIC, AS JONAH SAYS IN THAT COLUMN. EVENTUALLY OVER TIME NIXON KIND OF REHABILITATED HIMSELF, MADE HIMSELF INTO A FOREIGN POEMS MANDARIN, SOMEONE BILL CLINTON COULD EULOGIZE WHEN HE DIED, SPEAK ABOUT ACHIEVEMENTS AND OPENING TO CHINA AND OTHER THINGS. THE THING WITH TRUMP, HE'S WHO AS PATHETIC AS NIXON WAS AT HIS MOST PATHETIC ISOLATED SAD, DOESN'T HAVE HIS OWN -- PROBABLY LOOKING FOR REBOZO, BUT NO REAL PROSPECT ON THE HORIZON TRUMP CAN WRITE A BIG BOOK OF FOREIGN POLICY ON FOREIGN POLICY AS NIXON DID AND FIND HIS WAY INTO ESTABLISHMENT'S GOOD STEAD. IT'S FOREBODING OR FORETELL AS DARKER FUTURE LIES AHEAD FOR TRUMP THAN THE ONE THAT FACES NIXON POSTRESIGNATION.  THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. NIXON HAD HIS PATHOLOGIES AND SHOULDN'T FORGET SOME OF THE VENAL, VERY RACIST, ANTI-SUBMIT IMTHINGS SAID AND DID. WENT BACK AND READ A LOT OF WATERGATE BOOKS BECAUSE OF THE 50th ANNIVERSARY REMINDS HOW VAST AND EXTENSIVE THE MISCONDUCT REALLY WAS. ALWAYS A SERIOUS SIDE TO NIXON. THINGS HE REALLY CARED ABOUT. WAS A PATRIOT IN THE MOST GENUINE SENSE OF THE WORLD. CARED ABOUT POLICY THINGS. NOT ONLY OPENING OF CHINA, DETENTE WITH THE SOVIET UNION. AT HOME PRESIDED OVER CREATION OF THE EPA AND SIGNING OF THE CLEAN WATER ACT, CLEAN AIR ACT, A SERIOUS STUDENT OF POLICY, AND HE CARED ABOUT IDEAS AND WHERE THE COUNTRY WENT. HIS POST-PRESIDENCY REHABILITATING HIMSELF, PUTTING HIMSELF BACK IN THE GOOD GRACES OF HISTORY, IF NOTHING ELSE AND ALSO A PERIOD ENGAGING IN IDEAS AND ENGAGED IN THINGS HE OUT THAT THE COUNTRY SHOULD DO. THAT IS NOT TRUMP. NOTHING ABOUT THAT WITH TRUMP. HE'S NOT SITTING THERE OFFERING THE COUNTRY SOME GRAND THOUGHTS ABOUT WHERE WE SHOULD GO. SIMPLY RELITIGATING LIS 2020 ELECTION, RELITIGATING JANUARY 6th, AND ATTACKING JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATS, AND MITCH McCONNELL AND THE ESTABLISH REPUBLICANS. IT'S ALL CONFLICT FOR TRUMP. NO INTEREST IN HEALING. ONLY INTEREST IN TRUMP. I THINK THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NIXON AND TRUMP AND I THINK THE CLEM MAKE AS SHARP CONTRAST THERE.  RICHARD NIXON MAY HAVE WRITTEN LENGTHY VOLUMES IN FOREIGN POLICY. THE BOOKS UNDER DONALD TRUMP'S NAME, A PICTURE BOOK, WHICH I THINK MAKES SENSE. SO WE HAVE NOW A FEW PORTRAITS OF TRUMP IN THE WILDERNESS. TRUMP ALONE. TRUMP, SAD FIGURE, BUT KNOWING REPUBLICANS THE WAY YOU DO, IS HE GOING TO STAY THERE? OR IS HE, OF COURSE, HE COULD CHART FOR A COMEBACK?  YEAH. I LISTEN, AND HAVE TO THINK, I DON'T THINK DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO GO OUT WITH A WHIMPER. HE'S NOT ONE TO TAKE ALL OF THIS LAYING DOWN. CERTAINLY HE START ADD CAMPAIGN FAR EARLIER THAN A TRADITIONAL CANDIDATE WOULD. OBVIOUSLY, SUSPICIOUS TO STAVE OFF INVESTIGATIONS OR WHATEVER. AT SOME POINT DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO TURN THIS BACK ON AND GET BACK IN OUR FACES. THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION. OBVIOUSLY, NO ONE JUMPED IN TO ACTUALLY CHALLENGE HIM YET. RON DeSANTIS IN THE LEAD. THAT'S VERY REAL. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE TIRING OF THIS ACT, BUT WE'VE SOONER IT BEFORE. HE'S TAKEN ON A LOT OF REPUBLICANS ALWAYS WON. IN SOME WAY WILL COME OUT SWINGING. THE QUESTION, WHETHER VOTERS FIND THAT INTERESTING AGAIN. THERE'S A REAL CHANCE THEY JUST DO SEE IT AS SAD. THE MOST RECENT THING PUTTING OUT NFTs THE MOST PATHETIC THING SEEN. LIGHT OUR HAIR ON BUT SHRUGGED IT'S OLD, TIRING AND SAD, BUT SO MANY PEOPLE STILL LIKE HIM AND WHEN HE TURNS ON WHAT THEY LIKED ABOUT HIM, THAT BRAVADO, THAT \"AT LEAST HE FIGHTS\" MIND-SET, IT'S WAY TO EARLY TO SAY HE'S DONE.  FOR THE RECORD, THAT TRUMP ASTRONAUT REMAINS MY FAVORITE. THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US THIS MORNING. > AND STILL AHEAD ON \"MORNING JOE,\" THE TRUMP ERA IMMIGRATION POLICY KNOWN AT TITLE 42 WILL STAY IN EFFECT FOR NOW. WE'LL GO OVER WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE CRISIS AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. > PLUS, THE LATEST ON THE CONCUSSION CONTROVERSY INVOLVING MIAMI DOLPHINS QUARTERBACK TUA TAGOVAILOA. WILL RE BE ABLE TO RETURN THIS SEASON. > AND COVID-19, THE UNITED STATES LAYING RESTRICTIONS FOR VISITORS FROM CHINA. WE'LL TAKE A LOOK WHAT THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING. > YOU'RE WATCHING \"MORNING JOE,\" AND WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. S GAME.  AND THE RIM. [ CHEERS ]  A COMEBACK TO TIE IT WITH ONE SECOND LEFT!  THE GUY IS INCREDIBLE. THAT PLAY RARELY WORKS. LUKA DONCIC INTENTIONALLY MISSED HIS FREE THROW BEFORE HITTING THAT FINAL SHOT AGAINST THE NEW YORK KNICKS LAST NIGHT. MAVS OUTLAST THE KNICKS IN OVERNIGHT 126-121 WIN AND DONCIC FINISHED WITH A HISTORIC TRIPLE-DOUBLE. FIRST TIME AN NBA PLAYER POSTED AT LEAST 60 POINTS, 21 REBOUNDS, AND 10 ASSISTS.  LISTEN, IMPORTANTLY ON THIS, LEMIRE, A GREAT PLAYER. REALLY GOOD. OKAY? AND AN ASTERISK ABOUT THAT. PLAYING AGAINST THE KNICKS.  YOU'RE RIGHT. DOESN'T COUNT AS AN NBA RECORD.  AND \"NEW YORK POST\" SAYS, UNWATCHABLE KNICKS CHOKE IN THE FINAL SECOND. THE KNICKS, ANY SCORING RECORD, ANY OFFENSE, TRICK PLAYS THAT WORK, THEY ALL, GO, OKAY, YEAH, BUT THE KNICKS. NO REALTY THERE.  AND KNICKS A LITTLE BETTER.  A LITTLE. VERY LOW BAR.  A TOUGH LOSS, BUT LUKA AS WELL AS JOKIC FROM DENVER PUTTING UP SPECTACULAR SEASONS. > SWITCH NOW TO THE NFL, AND THE LEAGUE'S CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER SAYS MIAMI DOLPHINS QUARTERBACK TUA TAGOVAILOA DID NOT DISPLAY ANY CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS DURING SUNDAY'S GAME AGAINST THE GREEN BAY PACKERS. THAT'S DR. ALAN SILLS EXPLAINS WHY THE QB WAS ALLOWED TO CONTINUE PLAYING AFTER AN APPARENT BLOW TO THE HEAD TELLING NFL NOTWORK YESTERDAY THIS, NO SIRENS PRESENT. HE ADDED THE PLAYER DID NOT REPORT ANY SYMPTOMS DESPITE BEING IN CONTACT WITH THE MEDICAL STAFF DURING THE GAME. WATCHING IT HERE, TACKLED, FALLS BACK.  GOD.  IN REALTIME, MAYBE CAN'T PICK IT UP. PARTICULARLY WATCHING IN SLOW MOTION YOU SEE HIM KNOCKED DOWN, WATCH THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.  HEAD BOUNCES OFF THE TURF. OW!  THAT'S NO GOOD.  OW!  ONE DAY LATER TUA ENTERED THE LEAGUE'S CONCUSSION CALL SECOND TIME THIS SEASON SPARKING REAL CONCERN ABOUT HIS HIT AND SIGNIFICANT CRITICISM OVER THE TEAM'S HANDLING OF THE MATTER INCLUDING NFL HALL OF FAMER SHANNON SHARPE RECEIVED BACKLASH SUGGESTING THE DOLPHINS LIED ABOUT WHAT LOOKED LIKE A HEAD INJURY TUA SUFFERED AGAINST THE BUFFALO BILLS BACK IN WEEK THREE OCCURRING FOUR DAYS BEFORE THE QUARTERBACK WAS CARTED OFF THE FIELD IN A A CONCUSSION AGAINST THE SENATE BENGALS. REMEMBER, HIT. ALLOWED TO KEEP PLAYING. NEXT WEEK TOOK THAT SCARY HIT AGAINST BENGALS. HE SHOWED, LIKE, PHYSICALLY HIS HANDS ALMOST LOCKED. A SIGN OF A CONCUSSION. SCARY STUFF. WHAT SHARPE HAD TO SAY YESTERDAY.  AMP THAT HIT, 7-13, 80 YARDS, 62 ATTEMPTS, AND KEEP FAILING THIS MAN, BECAUSE NOW HE DISPLAYED NO SYMPTOMS FROM THAT POINT ON. REMEMBER, IN THE BUFFALO GAME, SKIP, TALKING ABOUT HIS BACK. HE HAS BACK INJURIES IN OFF-SEASON, WHAT FLARED UP A WHAT HE TOLD THEM. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT. I BELIEVE SPOTTER, DOLPHINS AND NFL ARE FAILING TUA. IF HE'S NOT CAREFUL, SKIP, HE'LL END HIS CAREER ON A FOOTBALL FIELD. NO GOOD FOR HIM, OR THE LEAGUE. THEY CAN SAY BACK IN BUFFALO, BUT THAT WAS A CONCUSSION. WE KNOW THAT. THAT'S THREE CONCUSSIONS IN SPAN OF FOUR MONTHS. I'M NOT A MEDICAL EXPERT BUT I JUST KNOW THAT'S NOT VERY GOOD.  MEANWHILE, PACKERS' QUARTERBACK AARON RODGERS PLAYING IN THIS 18th YEAR IN THE NFL SUGGESTED TUA SHOULD CONSIDER ENDING HIS SEASON.  IT'S PROBABLY TIME TO, TO MAYBE CONSIDER SHUTTING IT DOWN, WHEN YOU'VE HAD VARIOUS EPISODES. I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IN THE THOUGHT PROCESS. AS A COMPETITOR THAT'S THE LAST THING YOU WANT, BUT AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT YOUR COGNITIVE FUNCTION LATER IN LIFE AND AFTER-EFFECTS YOU MIGHT BE DEALING WITH.  IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER TUA WILL REJOIN THEM FOR THE PLAYOFF SEASON. A HUGE GAME IN NEW ENGLAND THIS WEEKEND. JOHN HEILEMANN, A RARITY WHEN AARON RODGERS IS THE VOICE OF REASON. SECONDLY, THIS IS A YOUNG PLAYER, HAVING A PRO BOWL-TYPE SEASON, EVEN MIDWAY THROUGH THE SEASON CONSIDERED MAYBE AN MVP CANDIDATE. ALL SECONDARY, ONE WOULD HOPE TO HIS HEALTH.  YOU KNOW, AARON RODGERS PUTS IT MILDLY. AT SOME POINT, THE KEY WORD IS REASON. THINKING ABOUT COGNITIVE FUNCTION AFTER FOOTBALL. TUA WILL HAVE A LIFE, HOPEFULLY, AFTER HIS FOOTBALL CAREER. WHETHER IT ENDS TOMORROWOR IN THE FUTURE. WHERE IS SOMEONE IN THIS PICTURE WHO CARES ABOUT HIS YOUNG MAN AND HIS FUTURE ON PLANET EARTH? HIS FOOTBALL CAREER, AT THE MOST, GREATEST FOOTBALL CAREER EVER MIGHT PLAY ANOTHER DECADE, BASICALLY. RIGHT? AVERAGE QUARTERBACK'S CAREER. YOU KNOW? AFTER THAT HE'S GOING TO BE -- HOPEFULLY, HAVE A NICE, LONG LIFE. 50, 60 MORE YEARS ON THE PLANET EARTH. 70 MORE YEARS. WHERE ARE HIS AGENTS, HIS MANAGERS? DOLPHINS, NFL, SEEM TO BE TOTALLY FAMING HIM, AS SHANNON SAID, AND SEEMS LIKE NO ONE IS ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF THIS MAN'S HEALTH AND CONTINUED COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING AS A PERSON ON PLANET EARTH. EVERYONE'S FOCUSED, A COMPETITOR, IS HE -- IN THE FOOTBALL CONTEXT, I'M FOCUSED ON THIS HUMAN BEING WHO SEEMS TO NOW BE, SEEMS TO BE SUBJECTED TO REPRESENTATIVE HEAD INJURY OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN ONE SEASON, AND NO ONE SEEMS TO BE WILLING TO STAND UP FOR HIM AND BE HIS VOICE.  AND SCIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT IT'S THE REPEATED CONCUSSIONS, HAVING MULTIPLE CONCUSSIONS LEADS TO MUCH GREATER DAMAGING EFFECTS DOWN THE ROAD. JOHN, WHILE TALKING, SHOWING CLIPS HERE.  HORRIBLE.  STAGGERING OFF THE FIELD AGAINST THE BILLS AND SHOWED THE HORRIBLE HIT AGAINST THE BENGALS AS WELL. IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY PLAYING HIM AGAIN THIS WEEK OR PROBABLY AGAIN THIS SEASON. > COMING UP HERE ON \"MORNING JOE,\" THE DEBUT OF THE ATLANTIC 10 JOINS BY THE MAGAZINE THE SENIOR EDITOR WITH BOOKS WITH A LOOK AT WORKS THAT \"MADE US THINK THE MOST THIS YEAR.\" \"MORNING JOE\" WILL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THAT. > 7:45 IN THE MORNING. THERE YOU HAVE IT. TIMES SQUARE ALREADY GETTING READY FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE. IF YOU LIKE COLD WEATHER AND CROWDS, WE COULD SEE YOU THERE SATURDAY NIGHT. THEY ARE GETTING READY. SEEMS A LITTLE CHILLY FOR ME. > NEARING THE END OF THIS YEAR, THE \"ATLANTIC\" A LIST OF TEN BOOKS MAKE YOU THINK THE MOST IN THE PAST YEAR. JOINING US SENIOR EDITOR FOR BOOKS AT THE \"ATLANTIC,\" THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. GIVE US A SENSE OF THE PARAMETERS, BECAUSE WHAT MADE YOU THINK IS A VERY, VERY BROAD UMBRELLA? WHAT EXACTLY WHERE YOU LOOKING FOR?  FIRST THING WE WERE TRYING TO DO, PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THESE END-OF-YEAR LISTS. RIGHT? A GREATNESS PURSUED. GREATEST ALBUMS, GREATEST FILMS, GREATEST BOOKS OF THE PAST YEAR, AND THAT NOTION SEEMED A LITTLE ABSURD TO ME ESPECIALLY WITH BOOKS. YOU KNOW, IT'S SUCH A SUBJECTIVE THING. HOW A BOOK REACHES YOU, AND THE WAY THAT YOU, THE WAY YOU INTERACT WITH THE BOOK AND WHAT ONE SEARCHES FOR IN A BOOK. SO IT STRUCK US AT \"THE ATLANTIC\" THE THING THAT MADE SENSE TO US, DISTINGUISH THE BOOKS IN A PHRASE WERE GOOD TO THINK WITH. BOOKS THAT SORTVOKED THOUGHT, OPENED UP NEW WORLDS AND ALLOWED THE READER TO ACCESS A DIFFERENT WAY OF THINKING. YES, STILL PRETTY BROAD, BUT NARROWS IT DOWN IN WAYS THAT SORT OF MADE SENSE TO US.  YEAH. I HAVE TO SAY, SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD SOLID \"ATLANTIC\" FRAMEWORK. RUN THROUGH A FEW. WON'T GET TO ALL TEN BUT SEVERAL DEAL WITH DISLOCATION IMMIGRATIONS. TALK ABOUT \"STAY TRUE,\" HOPE I'M GETTING PRONUNCIATION RIGHT, HUA HSU?  YES. A BOOK ABOUT FRIENDSHIP, CASTING BACK TO EARLY YEARS IN COLLEGE AND FRIENDSHIP DEVELOPED WITH ANOTHER ASIAN AMERICAN IMMIGRANT, AND THE STORY SORT OF HOW THEY -- HOW THEY GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER, OVERCAME DIFFERENCES AND EVENTUALLY HIS FRIEND ACTUALLY KILLED, MURDERED. REALLY A MEMOIR IN MANY WAYS, BUT EXPLORING SORT OF THE LONG-LASTING INFLUENCES OF FRIENDSHIP OF A HUMAN BEING.  \"THE CONVENTIONS\"?  A WONDERFUL SERIES OF SHORT STORIES ABOUT FARM LABORERS IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND FIT THE MOLD OF BOOKS THAT EXPOSED US TO DIFFERENT SORTS OF REALITIES, THAT ONE MIGHT NOT, YOU KNOW, HAVE HAD, NORMALLY HAD ACCESS TO, AND FICTION, OF COURSE, IS AN AMAZING WAY TO DO THAT.  YEAH. AND I LOVE, LOVE THE BREADTH OF GEOGRAPHIES. A LOT SET IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT WITH IMMIGRANTS EXPERIENCES IN THE UNITED STATES, LIKE THOSE TWO WERE, BUT I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE ONE ABOUT, PERSONAL HISTORY VINTON O'TOOLE. COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF GENRE?  RIGHT. A BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN BOOK. ALL OF A CERTAIN LITERALLY QUALITY WE FELT WE COULD ENDORSE AND THIS BOOK IN PARTICULAR A BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN BOOK. ANOTHER BOOK ACTUALLY TWO OR THREE SORT OF MIX MEMOIR AND HISTORY IN INTERESTING WAYS. HE IS TELLING ABOUT HIS OWN PERSONAL STORY ABOUT GROWING UM IN IRELAND, HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE STORY AND ENTERING IN MODERNITY. FOR EXAMPLE, LOOKS AT A COUNTRY ONCE FEARLY OPPOSED TO ABORTION. YOU KNOW? THEN SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, AND HAS COME TO EVOLVE ON THOSE ISSUES, BUT DOES IT WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF HIS OWN LIFE AND HIS OWN SORT OF RELATIONSHIP TO THE COUNTRY AND HOW IT'S CHANGED OVER TIME.  OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE FULL LIST, BY THE WAY, OF THE \"ATLANTIC TEN\" ONLINE @THEATLANTA.COM. IF YOU NEED HOLIDAY READING ALL THERE. GREAT ALL OF THEM. I CHALLENGE YOU TO AT LEAST GET TRY A COUPLE BY END OF THIS YEAR. > UP NEXT FROM NASA'S GIANT LEAP TOWARDS PUTTING A MAN BACK ON THE MOON TO SPECTACULAR NEW IMAGES FROM DEEP AMONG THE STARS. WE TAKE A LOOK BACK AT THE YEAR OF TRIUMPHS FOR SPACE EXPLORATION. > \"MORNING JOE\" WILL BE RIGHT BACK. > WELCOME BACK. IT'S 7:52 HERE ON THE EAST COAST. THIS IS A SHOT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, NASA TELLS US IT'S OVER THE ATLANTIC OCEAN RIGHT NOW. BEAUTIFUL AS 2022 DRAWS TO A CLOSE. IT HAS BEEN A YEAR OF INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS WITH ANYBODY IN SPACE EXPLORATION. NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT, TOM COSTELLO, DOCUMENTED ALL OF THOSE DEVELOPMENTS AND SHARES SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS.  3, 2, 1 -- BOOSTERS AND IGNITION --  IN A YEAR OF TRIUMPHS, THE NEW TEST FLIGHT OF THE NEW SPACESHIP. A LONG ORBIT DEEPER INTO SPACE.  ORION IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY.  THEN THE HEAT SHIELD HITTING 5,000 DEGREES, AND THAT'S HALF OF THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SUN. BEFORE A GENTLE PARACHUTE DROP INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN.  IT IS THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW BEGINNING, AND THAT IS TO EXPLORE THE HEAVENS.  THAT NEW BEGINNING WILL INCLUDE ASTRONAUTS ON A SIMILAR TEST FLIGHT AROUND THE MOON IN 2024, AND THEN A LUNAR LANDING IN 2025 OR '26 WITH A CREW THAT INCLUDES A WOMAN AND A PERSON OF COLOR. THE FIRST RETURN TO THE MOON SINCE THOSE DAYS OF \"APOLLO.\"  THE EAGLE HAS LANDED.  NASA IS ALSO LEANING HEAVILY ON PRIVATE COMPANIES. SPACEX NOW REGULARLY LAUNCHES BOTH CREW AND CARGO TO THE ISS. THIS IS THE VIEW OF EARTH FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, AND THE SIMULATOR AT NASA IN HOUSTON. OUTSIDE THE COUPE LAW, THE BLUE RICHNESS OF EARTH, AND THE BLACKNESS OF SPACE. AND THEN AN ARM TO REACH OUT AND GRAB CARGO. AND THEN THE STAR SHIP THAT WILL PERHAPS CARRY PASSENGERS TO THE MOON AND PERHAPS MARS. AND THEN NASA'S MISSION, THE SPACECRAFT SLAMMING INTO A SMALL ASTROID CALLED DIMORPHOS. IT'S A SUCCESS IF NASA NEEDS TO DEFLECT AN ASTROID AWAY FROM EARTH. BUT THE MOST VISUAL SPACE ACHIEVEMENT IN 2022 WERE THOSE SPECTACULAR IMAGES FROM THE DEEP SPACE JAMES WEB TELESCOPE USING INFRARED CAMERAS, AND WE'RE LOOKING AT LIGHT BILLIONS-YEAR-OLD, AND THE CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE, THE STARS AND THE GALAXY, AND BEGGING THE QUESTION ARE WE ALONE?  WE COULD HAVE AN ANSWER ABOUT WHETHER THERE IS LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE, AND IT WOULD CHANGE OUR ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE WERE AND WHO WE ARE IN THE UNIVERSE.  IT'S BIG AND BECKONING TO A NEW GENERATION OF EXPLORERS. TOM COSTELLO, NBC NEWS, HOUSTON.  SPECTACULAR IMAGES, AND SUCH AN IMPRESSIVE YEAR. WHILE SPACE TRAVEL MAY BE GOING WELL, THE SAME CAN'T BE SAID FOR AIR TRAVEL RIGHT NOW. SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CONTINUES TO CANCEL THOUSANDS OF FLIGHTS LEAVING PASSENGERS STRANDED AFTER THE HOLIDAYS. WE WILL GET A LIVE REPORT FROM ONE OF THE NATION'S BUSIEST AIRPORTS. > PLUS, HOUSE LAWMAKERS TAKE ACTION WHEN IT COMES TO TIKTOK ON GOVERNMENT DEVICES.

JOE, MIKA AND WILLIE HAVE A WELL-DESERVED DAY OFF. > LEFT IN LIMBO AGAIN, AND THAT'S HOW MANY IN THE MIGRANT COMMUNITY MAY BE FEELING AFTER THE SUPREME COURT DECIDED TO KEEP IN PLACE TITLE 42. IT ALLOWS BORDER OFFICIALS TO DENY ASYLUM SEEKERS INTO THE UNITED STATES DUE TO PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS. MEANWHILE THE RECENT FLOOD OF MIGRANTS CONTINUE TO OVERWHELM AMERICA'S BORDER CITIES. NBC'S SAM BROCK IS IN ONE OF THOSE TOWNS, EL PASO, TEXAS.  THE OVERBURDENED SECTION OF EL PASO, DISAPPOINTMENT. I'M SAD. VERY SAD. THEY TOLD US THEY WOULD GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY. HIS FRIEND JUMPS IN. I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE ALL HUMAN BEINGS HE SAYS, AND MOMENTS LATER IF I ASK IF THEY WOULD RATHER BE HERE OR IN THEIR HOMETOWN OF VENEZUELA -- WIDESPREAD AGREEMENT, YES, THEY SAY AT LEAST HERE WE EAT BREAD WITH HAM AND CHEESE AND IN VENEZUELA, YOU MIGHT BE ONLY ABLE TO AFFORD THE BREAD. EL PASO OFFICIALS EXPECT ANOTHER LENGTHY STRETCH OF UNCERTAINTY.  THEY CONTINUE TO GET IN WITHOUT BEING UNDETECTED, WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS POPULATION GROW WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT'S CONCERNING.  EL PASO IS COORDINATING WITH LOCAL CHURCHES AND NON-PROFITS TO PROVIDE THREE MEALS A DAY WITH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE.  THESE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID. THERE'S PLENTY OF SHELTER. EL PASO HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF HELPING EL PASO, AND MANY OF THESE DO NOT HAVE THE PAPERWORK.  FOR THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS HERE FROM VENEZUELA, THE ONE MAN PUTS IT ALL IN PERSPECTIVE. EVERYTHING IN THE NAME OF LOVE, THE PAST IS HISTORY, AND TOMORROW IS A MYSTERY AND WE'RE IN THE PRESENT WITH THE PRESENT YOU MAKE THE BEST OUT OF THE FUTURE. NBC'S SAM BROCK WITH THAT REPORT FROM EL PASO, TEXAS. JOINING US NOW, STATE ATTORNEY FROM PALM BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA, OUR FRIEND, DAVE AARONBURG. THE SUPREME COURT STEPPED IN AND DID SOMETHING AT LEAST SO FAR CONGRESS IN THE WHITE HOUSE WERE NOT ABLE TO DO, IMPLEMENT A DECISION OF WHAT TO DO THERE AT THE BORDER. GIVE US YOUR ANALYSIS OF WHAT YOU SAW FROM THE JUSTICES YESTERDAY AND GIVE US THE TIMETABLE AS WHAT HAPPENS NEXT FOR TITLE 42.  GOOD MORNING, JONATHAN. THIS WAS NOT A DECISION ON THE MERITS OF TITLE 42, AND THIS WAS PROCEDURAL RULING ON WHETHER SOME STATES COULD INTERVENE AND COMPEL THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO KEEP ENFORCING TITLE 42, AND THE SUPREME COURT KICKED THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND FROZE THE TITLE 42 POLICY UNTIL A DECISION IS MADE LATER. AND CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS SET THE ORAL ARGUMENTS FOR FEBRUARY AND WE WON'T KNOW ANYTHING UNTIL THEN. THERE'S REASON TO BELIEVE THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION WILL ULTIMATELY PREVAIL BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT PREVIOUSLY FAVORED THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ON SOME IMMIGRATION MATTERS. REMEMBER, THEY ALLOWED THE ADMINISTRATION TO END TRUMP'S REMAIN IN MEXICO POLICY, AND FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT, ALLOWING STATES TO FORCE THE POLICIES OF A PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION ON TO A NEW ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T SOUND LIKE GOOD LAW, AND IT CERTAINLY TAKES STATES' RIGHTS TO A WHOLE NEW DIMENSION, AND IT WILL TAKE THE BRIDGE TOO FAR FOR THIS CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT.  IT GETS TO THE ROLE OF THE SUPREME COURT MORE BROADLY, AND GORSUCH WROTE, WE ARE A COURT OF LAW AND NOT POLICYMAKERS OF LAST RESORT. UNPACK THAT FOR US IN A CONSERVATIVE ENVIRONMENT WITH THE STATES LOBBYING IT TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP THE BORDER STATES.  RIGHT, THAT'S A GOOD POINT. GORSUCH JOINED WITH THE LIBERALS TO VOTE ON THIS ISSUE. I AM OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER, RIGHTS IN AMERICA HAS FALLEN IN LOVE WITH ACTIVISM. YOU CAN CALL THIS DECISION GOOD, YOU CAN CALL IT BAD, BUT DON'T CALL THIS DECISION CONSERVATIVE. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF JUDICIAL RESTRAINT HERE, AND THE SUPREME COURT IS TELLING THE SAME BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THAT IMPLEMENTED THIS POLICY THAT IT CAN'T UNIMPLEMENT THIS POLICY UNTIL THEY SAY SO.  CERTAINLY THE IMAGES REFLECT WHAT A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS THIS IS, AND IT'S ALSO A POLITICAL STORY, AND THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE SAID THEY WANTED IT TO GO AWAY, AND ADVISERS TELL ME YESTERDAY THEY BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF AT THIS STAY, BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHEN IT'S LIFTED THERE WILL BE A HUGE INFLUX OF MIGRANTS AND A HEADACHE FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION.  FOR SURE. AND IT'S ONE OF THESE PLACES WHERE HAVING THE COURT DO CERTAIN THINGS FOR AN ADMINISTRATION IS HELPFUL POLITICALLY BECAUSE YOU CAN PUSH IT OFF ON THE COURT, AND THAT RAISES THE QUESTION, YOU MENTIONED GORSUCH'S DISSENT, AND HE SAID WE ARE NOT POLICYMAKERS OF LAST RESORT. WE NEED TO TALK MORE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE IT'S SO WIDELY ASSUMED THAT THERE'S A CONSERVATIVE BLOCK THAT CONSERVATIVES ALL VOTE THE SAME WAY, AND HERE WE SEE A SPLIT -- THE 6-3 MAJORITY GOT GORSUCH IN THE MINORITY ON THE DISSENT. WHAT DOES THAT KIND OF SPLIT SUGGEST IN THE WAYS THE CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY MAY NOT BE AS MONOLITHIC AS PEOPLE ASSUMED AS WE GO FORWARD?  CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS HAS A REPRESENTATION OF BEING A PRINCIPLIST, AND THIS IS NOT JUDICIAL RESTRAINT THIS IS THE JUDGES DOING SOMETHING THAT CONGRESS REFUSED TO DO. THERE'S ALWAYS HYPOCRISY, AND THE BIGGEST ADVOCATES FOR TITLE 42 NOW WERE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THE BIGGEST OPPONENTS OF GOVERNMENT RESTRICTIONS WHEN IT CAME TO COVID. A LOT OF THEM MOCKED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE PANDEMIC, BUT NOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE COVID ERA CDC POLICY, THEY ARE FOR THE TITLE, AND TITLE 42 EXISTS BECAUSE CONGRESS WON'T DO ITS JOB AND IT'S BASED ON A FALSEHOOD, AND IT WAS NEVER ABOUT PROTECTING AGAINST COVID. THIS WAS ABOUT STOPPING MIGRANTS OVER THE SOUTHERN BORDER. NOW THAT BIDEN DECLARED THE PANDEMIC OVER, THE GIG IS UP. > STATE ATTORNEY FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY, DAVID ARONBURG, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. NEXT, WE WILL SPEAK ABOUT THE APP TIKTOK, AND THERE'S A GROWING DEBATE ON WHETHER THE CHINESE-OWNED APP POSES A NATIONAL SECURITY RISK. JOINING ME NOW IS NBC CORRESPONDENT, STEPHANIE GOSK. IS THERE A POSSIBILITY THAT NOBODY, INCLUDING YOU OR I, COULD HAVE TIKTOK ON OUR PHONES -- DISCLAIMER, I DO NOT HAVE TIKTOK ON MY PHONE.  NEITHER DO I. IT OPENS UP A WHOLE HOST OF QUESTIONS, AND THERE ARE PEOPLE ASKING IS TIKTOK SAFE, AND THE COMPANY WHICH IS CHINESE-OWNED SAYS IT IS, AND THERE ARE MANY THAT HAVE CONCERNS FROM STATES TO COLLEGES AND NOW THE LATEST, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. TIKTOK IS BEST KNOWN FOR ITS VIRAL VIDEOS FROM EVERYTHING FROM POPULAR DANCE ROUTINES TO SHOPPING HALLS, BUT IN WASHINGTON IT'S BECOMING ONE OF THE MOST DELETED APPS. THE HOUSE THE LATEST BRANCH TO ANNOUNCE A BAN, SAYING HOUSE MEMBERS AND STAFFERS MUST DELETE AND MAY NO LONGER DOWNLOAD TIKTOK ON THEIR GOVERNMENT ISSUED DEVICES, AND THE ADMINISTRATION OFFICER CALLED THE APP A SECURITY RISK. THIS COMES AFTER CONGRESS APPROVED THE $1.7 TRILLION SPENDING BILL, INCLUDING A REQUIREMENT FOR EXECUTIVE BRANCH AGENCY EMPLOYEES TO REMOVE TIKTOK FROM THEIR WORK PHONES AND IT GOES BEYOND THE CAPITOL. SOME UNIVERSITIES ARE NOW BLOCKING ACCESS TO THE APP ON SCHOOL WI-FI OR DEVICES. TIKTOK OWNED BY A CHINESE COMPANY, BYTEDANCE, BUT HAS SAID IN THE PAST IT DOES NOT STORE U.S. USER DATA IN CHINA AND DOES NOT SHARE INFORMATION WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. TIKTOK IS NEGOTIATING A DEAL WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS SECURITY CONCERNS. CEO, JANESSA PAPPIOUS, SPEAKING IN A MEETING. AMONG TIKTOK'S 100 MILLION USERS EVERY MONTH ARE CONGRESSMEN USING THE APP TO CONNECT WITH VOTERS. WHILE OTHERS HAVE PROPOSED BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO BAN THE APP ALTOGETHER, A MOVE THAT HAD TIKTOKERS UP IN ARMS.  CHINA, SO WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND BAN TIKTOK AGAIN.  THIS WILL AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND COOL FRIENDSHIPS WE MADE ALONG THE WAY.  TIKTOK TELLS US THEY MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN THIS NEGOTIATION, AND THEY POINT OUT ONCE IT'S OVER AND AGREED ON THE NEW SECURITY AND OVERSIGHT, THEY WILL BE SUBJECT TO MORE RESTRICTIONS THAN THEIR COMPETITION, BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE CALLS FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE TO DELETE THE APP OFF YOUR PHONE.  AND IT WOULD BE A BIG DEAL AS OTHER SOCIAL MEDIA SITES STRUGGLING, TIKTOK IS STILL GROWING.  YEAH, IT'S REALLY POPULAR, AND AGAIN, ENFORCING A BAN LIKE THAT IN THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE PRETTY TOUGH.  THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT. WE NEED TO POSE THE QUESTION TO YOU, CATTY KAY. DO YOU HAVE IT ON YOUR PHONE?  I DON'T, BUT MY 16-YEAR-OLD WILL BE IN A TOTAL UPROAR IF SOMEBODY TRIES TO DELETE IT FROM HER PHONE. > SOUTHWEST AIRLINES IS REPORTING MORE CANCELATIONS FOR TODAY AND FOR TOMORROW. BLAYNE, THEY SAY THEY ARE GOING TO TRY AND FIX THIS, BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE UNTIL NEXT WEEK BEFORE TRAVEL GETS BACK TO NORTH ON SOUTHWEST?  Reporter: YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY, CATTY, THE CEO SPOKE OUT AND SAID THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE AND WILL TAKE SOME DAYS TO GET BACK ON TRACK. WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING BEHIND ME IS THE RIPPLE AFFECT OF ALL THIS. PILES OF BAGGAGE NOT HERE IN ATLANTA, BUT BAGGAGE IS ARRIVING AND PASSENGERS ARE NOT WITH NOBODY TO CLAIM THEM. BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TWEETED SAYING AIRLINES NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME FOR THE THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS TO BE REBOOKED ON SOUTHWEST. WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF FLIGHTS CANCELED THIS MORNING, IT'S TRAVELER FRUSTRATION REACHING NEW HEIGHTS. IN CHICAGO AND AROUND THE COUNTRY, MOUNTAINS OF LUGGAGE WITH NO TRAVELERS TO CLAIM THEM.  I WANT TO CRY. I AM TIRED.  FRUSTRATED. TIRED. PISSED OFF.  SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CEO APOLOGIZING FOR THE TRAVEL NIGHTMARE THAT LEFT TWO-THIRDS OF THE AIRLINES FLIGHTS GROUNDED.  WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO RETURN TO A NORMAL OPERATION, AND PLEASE ALSO HEAR THAT I AM TRULY SORRY.  FOR A THIRD STRAIGHT DAY SOUTHWEST CANCELED A MAJORITY OF ITS FLIGHTS SLASHING A WHOPPING 2,500 FLIGHTS ON WEDNESDAY AND THE SAME AMOUNT FOR THURSDAY, LEAVING THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS STRANDED DURING THE WEEK.  I GOT HERE AT 4:30 A.M. FOR OUR 8:00 A.M. FLIGHT, WHICH WAS DELAYED, DELAYED, DELAYED, AND DELAYED, AND THEN CANCELED.  FRUSTRATION ECHOED BY TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY, PETE BUTTIGIEG.  THIS HAS CROSSED THE LINE FROM WHAT WAS AN UNCONTROLLABLE WEATHER SITUATION TO SOMETHING THAT IS THE AIRLINE'S RESPONSIBILITY.  SOUTHWEST WAS HIT HARD BY THE WEATHER WITH TWO MAJOR HUBS IN CHICAGO AND DENVER RIGHT IN THE STORM'S PATH. BUT THE AIRLINE BEARS RESPONSIBILITY FOR USING AN OLD SYSTEM THAT CAUSED BACKUPS IN EMPLOYEES SCHEDULING.  IT'S A PROCESS FROM THE '90s THAT CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE NETWORK FROM TODAY.  ALL OF IT IS LEAVING DESPERATE PASSENGERS LIKE RICK AND EMILY JIMENEZ SEARCHING FOR ANOTHER WAY HOME. THEY TOOK A 13-HOUR BUS RIDE TO ATLANTA HOPING FOR A BETTER WAY TO GET HOME FROM A DIFFERENT CITY. OTHER AIRLINES ARE STEPPING UP TRYING TO HELP THESE MANY PASSENGERS GET ON SOME SORT OF FLIGHT. OVERNIGHT WE HEARD FROM AMERICAN AND DELTA AIRLINES THAT ANNOUNCED THEY WILL CAP THEIR AIRFARE IN THE CITIES TO TRY AND MAKE IT MORE APPEASEABLE FOR PEOPLE TO BOOK DIFFERENT FLIGHTS.  STEPPING IN TO TRY AND HELP THOSE STRANDED PASSENGERS. THERE'S NOTHING WORSE THAN BEING SHUT OFF FROM YOUR KIDS AND NOT BEING ABLE TO REACH THEM BECAUSE OF AIR TRAVEL. BLAYNE ALEXANDER, THANK YOU FOR REPORTING FROM ATLANTA AIRPORT. WHAT A MESS THAT WAS.  JUST A COMPLETE MESS. THE BLAME SEEMS TO FALL SQUARELY ON SOUTHWEST'S TECHNOLOGY ISSUES. ONE FLIGHT ATTENDANT SPENT 17 HOURS ON HOLD TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HER NEXT ASSIGNMENT. OTHER REPORTERS ARE OUT WITH A NEW PIECE WITH SOME OF THE MOST SHOCKING 2022 RESULTS. KARI LAKE FROM ARIZONA, AND ARIZONA REPUBLICANS WENT DOWN IN STATE-WIDE RACES FOR GOVERNOR, THE SENATE, AND SECRETARY OF STATE. IT WAS PART OF A TREND OF MAGA ELECTION DENIERS LOSING IN SWING STATES. THAT INCLUDES DIXON IN MICHIGAN AND MASTRIANO IN PENNSYLVANIA. AND ANOTHER STORY LINE, REPUBLICAN GAINS IN NEW YORK. THE GOP FLIPPED A REMARKABLE FOUR-HOUSE SEAT STATEWIDE. A CRUCIAL RESULT THAT ENABLED THEIR NARROW 220 TO 213 HOUSE MAJORITY, DOING SO IN A DEEP BLUE STATE. WE HAVE DEMOCRATIC LANDSLIDES IN PENNSYLVANIA AND MICHIGAN. JOHN FETTERMAN WAS A PICKUP AND HELPED DEMOCRATS ADD TO THEIR SENATE MAJORITY. IN ALASKA, SARAH PALIN LOST TO A DEMOCRAT, TWICE. FIRST IN THE AUGUST SPECIAL ELECTION, AND THEN THE DEMOCRAT WON IN NOVEMBER THIS TIME FOR A FULL TERM. AND FAR-RIGHT CONGRESSWOMAN'S LOSS IN COLORADO, AND THEN A SIGNIFICANT RESULT ON ABORTION RIGHTS PARTICULARLY IN KANSAS, WHERE AN AUGUST REFERENDUM REJECTING A MEASURE THAT WOULD HAVE LEFT ROOM FOR A BAN IN THE PROCEDURE, A MAJOR INDICATOR OF WHERE THINGS WERE HEADED IN NOVEMBER. SO JOHN, OUR COLLEAGUES HERE AT NBC DID A GOOD JOB REVEALING SOME OF THE SURPRISING RESULTS IN THE ELECTIONS, AND WHAT STOOD OUT TO YOU?  NOTHING MORE THAN THE KANSAS VOTE. I THINK -- MIDTERMS COME AND GO, AND THE DEMOCRATIC PERFORMANCE IN THIS ONE WAS SURPRISING AND OUTSIDE THE BOUNDS OF NORMAL PRECEDENT AND AN ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR JOE BIDEN AND HIS PARTY, AND AT THE CORE OF IT WAS ABORTION RIGHTS. IT WAS A BRAVE NEW WORLD. WE HAVE NEVER SEEN AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT THE COURT HANDED DOWN AND THEN SNATCHED AWAY, SO ALL OF US WERE IN THE DARK ABOUT WHAT THE POLITICAL CONSEQUENCE THAT WOULD BE, AND ANYBODY WHO WAS SENSIBLE SAID AT THE TIME THERE MIGHT BE A GROUND SWELL AND MIGHT NOT, WE JUST DON'T KNOW. WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER, THERE'S NO PRECEDENT FOR IT. KANSAS CAME ALONG IN AUGUST, A BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT WAS PUT UP IN AUGUST, AS IT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME, IT'S LIKE AUGUST IN KANSAS, IT'S JUST BRUTAL. YOU KNOW, IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE A LOW TURNOUT AFFAIR AND DESIGNED TO STACK THE DECK FOR THE ANTI-ABORTION SIDE AND YET THERE WAS A GROUNDSWELL WHERE ESSENTIALLY ONE OF THE REDDEST STATES IN THE COUNTRY, AND EVERYBODY ASSUMED ABORTION RIGHTS WERE DOOMED, NOT ONLY DID ABORTION RIGHTS HOLD BUT MIRRORED THE NATIONAL CONSENSUS IN FAVOR OF ROE V. WADE WITH A MASSIVE TURNOUT IN AUGUST. AND AT THAT MOMENT PEOPLE IN OUR BUSINESS LOOKED AT THAT AND SAID, MAN, THAT COULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FALL, WHICH IT DID. ALSO, IF YOU ARE A PERSON THAT BELIEVES THAT WANTS TO LOOK FOR POSITIVE SIGNS IN OUR POLITICAL CULTURE, THAT ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, YOU KNOW. THE PEOPLE ARE GALVANIZING TO GO OUT AND DO THE WORK. PEOPLE THAT CARED ABOUT THE ISSUE WENT IN THE FACE OF A DEVASTATING HISTORICAL BLOW BY THE SUPREME COURT, THEY WENT OUT AND SAID WE DON'T CARE THAT IT'S KANSAS OR THAT IT'S A RED STATE, WE WILL GO AND WORK AND ORGANIZE AND THEY WENT OUT THERE ON THE GROUND AND THEY WON AND WON DECISIVELY AND SET THE TABLE FOR THE FALL. IT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT STATE REFERENDUM VOTES THAT FORETOLD A LOT OF WHAT OUR POLITICS LOOKED LIKE FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR AND THE POLITICS FOR ABORTION FOR YEARS TO COME.  AND SET THE STAGE FOR 5-5 VICTORY FOR ABORTION RIGHT ADVOCATES THAT HAD ABORTION ON THE BALLOT IN 2022, AND USED AS A TOOL IN MICHIGAN NOT JUST ON THAT REFERENDUM. AND THE ARIZONA RESULTS, NOT JUST THE KARI LAKE RESULTS, AND YOU HAD TWO PEOPLE BEING ELECTED, KARI LAKE AS GOVERNOR, AND MARK FITCHAM AS SECRETARY OF STATE. THEY WERE GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY ELECTIONS WERE HELD AND POTENTIALLY CHANGE THE WAY ELECTIONS WERE CERTIFICATED OR NOT CERTIFICATED. IT'S NO STRETCH TO SAY THOSE TWO PEOPLE COULD HAVE SWUNG ARIZONA TO DONALD TRUMP IN 2024 IF THEY HAD CHOSEN TO DO SO. BOTH OF THEM LOST IN A STATE WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR THE STOP THE STEAL IDEA, AND IT WAS GROUND ZERO BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP MADE IT SO AND NEITHER PREVAILED AND IT WAS AN INDICATION OF HOW PEOPLE DID NOT WANT TO PUT PEOPLE IN POSITIONS OVER ELECTIONS AND WOULD CHANGE THE OUTCOMES IN WAYS THAT WERE NOT FAIR.  PLENTY OF RE-ELECTED ELECTION DENIERS, AND THEY LOST. DEMOCRATS BET THE CLOSING ARGUMENTS ON ABORTION RIGHTS PAID OFF. > AND GEORGE SANTOS UNDER EXTREME SCRUTINY AFTER ADMITTING HE LIED ON HIS RESUME. > AND TESLA STOCK MAY SEE ITS WORTH MONTH ON RECORD, AS THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT ELON MUSK'S MANAGEMENT STYLE ON TWITTER.

        "trs": "> AS ELECTION NIGHT PROGRESSED, AND WE ALL SAT THERE WATCHING STEVE KORNACKI WATCH THE RESULTS COME IN, IT BECAME CLEARER AND CLEARER TO EVERYONE THAT NOT ONLY WOULD THERE BE NO MIDTERM RED WAVE, BUT WITH THE HELP OF A SMALL GROUP OF INDEPENDENT AND REPUBLICAN VOTERS, THERE WOULD BE A WHOLESALE REJECTION OF ELECTION-DENYING CANDIDATES WHO WERE SEEKING CONTROL OVER THE NEXT ELECTION. \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" TODAY HAS TAKEN A LOOK AT THE GROUP OF REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO WERE CONCERNED ENOUGH ABOUT THE STATE OF OUR DEMOCRACY, THIS, QUOTE, PRECARIOUSLY NARROW BUT CONSEQUENTIAL SLICE OF THE ELECT RATHER THAT BROKE WITH THE GOP AND ITS ELECTION LIES, FED UP WITH ELECTION DENIERS LIKE DOUG MASTRIANO, WHO PROMISED TO INSTALL A SECRETARY OF STATE IN PENNSYLVANIA WHO WOULD DO HIS AND DONALD TRUMP'S BIDDING FROM THAT \"TIMES\" REPORT TODAY, QUOTE, IT WAS SO REPREHENSIBLE, THAT'S PENNSYLVANIA REPUBLICAN JOE M MOLLLER I DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY LIKE THAT. DISCERNIBLE SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS DID NOT NECESSARILY LAY TO REST CONCERNS ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE ELECTION SYSTEM TO WITHSTAND THE NEW PRESSURES UNLEASHED UPON IT BY MR. TRUMP, BUT THEY DID SUGGEST A POSSIBLE CEILING ON THE APPEAL OF EXTREME PARTISANSHIP, ONE THAT PREVENTED IN THIS CYCLE THE WORST FEARS FOR THE HEALTH OF DEMOCRACY FROM BEING REALIZED JOINING US NOW, MICHIGAN'S DEMOCRATIC SECRETARY OF STATE JOCELYN BENSON, WHO WON REELECTION THIS NOVEMBER, DEFEATING A TRUMP-BACKED ELECTION DENIER. BASIL IS STILL WITH US MADAM SECRETARY, I FEEL LIKE THIS IS SOMETHING WE INTUITED AND WE TALKED ABOUT, AND SOMETHING YOU, YOU KNOW, KNEW OR FELT OR WERE HEARING IN MICHIGAN BUT THIS REPORTING THAT LOOKS AT STATES LIKE YOURS AND SAYS THAT THERE REALLY WAS A LIMIT ON THE APPEAL OF THIS ANTI-DEMOCRATIC EXTREMISM IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS AT ONCE REASSURING AND MAKES ME SORT OF WANT TO PUT TOGETHER THE COALITION FOR DEMOCRACY TO BE A PERMANENT VOTING BLOCK HOW DO YOU READ THESE STORIES AND THESE REPORTS?  YEAH, EXACTLY WHAT WE SAW ON THE GROUND LEADING UP TO ELECTION DAY REALLY THROUGHOUT THE LAST YEAR WAS REFLECTED IN THE DATA, WHICH IS THAT VOTERS SAW DEMOCRACY WAS ON THE BALLOT. THAT IT WASN'T A PARTISAN ISSUE, IT WAS AN AMERICAN ISSUE IT WAS ONE THAT WE COULD ALL COME TOGETHER AROUND, FORM A NONPARTISAN PRO-DEMOCRACY COALITION OF VOTERS. AND MY HOPE IS THE ARTICLE TALKED ABOUT IT BEING A NARROW SLICE OF FOLKS WHO WERE WILLING TO CROSS OVER AND SEE THIS AS A NONPARTISAN ISSUE. WE'VE GOT TO EXPAND THAT COALITION, EXPAND THAT SLICE IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD THOUGH ELECTION DENIALISM WAS PROVEN TO BE A LOSING STRATEGY, IT STILL IS A STRATEGY, AND IT'S ONE WE CAN EXPECT TO BE LEVEED IN THE 2024 CYCLE.  AND YOU AND GOVERNOR WHITMER, YOU HAD THE ABILITY AS AN ENTIRE TICKET TO COMMUNICATE THESE THEMES ABOUT DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM. AND I KNOW GOVERNOR WHITMER TIED THEM TO THE EXTREME POLICIES ON ABORTION EMBRACED BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THIS VERY CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT JOSH SHAPIRO WAS ABLE TO DO THAT IN PENNSYLVANIA. IS THERE LIKE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT WORKED, ABOUT WHAT YOU DID THAT WORKED, ABOUT WHAT GOVERNOR WHITMER DID THAT WORKED, ABOUT WHAT JOSH SHAPIRO DID THAT WORKED?  YES WE ARE COLLABORATING, PARTICULARLY IN THE SIX BATTLEGROUND STATES, ARIZONA, NEVADA, GEORGIA, MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, PENNSYLVANIA. WE'VE BEEN TALKING REGULARLY THROUGHOUT THE CYCLE, BUT WE RECOGNIZE HOW POWERFUL THAT COORDINATED MESSAGE WAS, THAT UNIFIED MESSAGE, TO SAY TO EVERY VOTER, NOT JUST OUR DEMOCRACY, BUT YOUR RIGHTS, YOUR FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS ARE ON THE LINE, AND THEY CONTINUE TO BE ON THE LINE SO ONE OF THE STRENGTHS ACTUALLY COMING OUT OF THE 2020 ELECTION CYCLE WAS ALL OF US IN THESE SIX STATES IN PARTICULAR LOOKING AROUND AND SAYING WE'RE BATTLING THE SAME THING LET'S WORK TOGETHER IN OUR RESPONSE AND I THINK YOU SAW THAT PLAY OUT IN A COORDINATED EFFORT IN '22, AND WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET STRONGER NOW, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT MORE PLAYERS, MORE FOLKS ON THE FIELD IN NEVADA AND OTHER STATES SO WE HAVE NOW EXPANDED OUR COALITION FOR '24, AND IT MAKES ME ENCOURAGED. BUT, AGAIN, WE NEED THE VOTERS TO CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE DEMOCRACY IN ORDER FOR OUR STRENGTH TO REALLY BE REALIZED  YOU KNOW, BASIL, I WANT TO BRING YOU IN BECAUSE YOU ARE A STUDENT OF SORT OF ELECTIONS AND BETTER BEHAVIORS THE WAY I AM. I SEE THIS REAL STRUCTURAL OPPORTUNITY FOR DEMOCRATS WITH THIS COALITION OF VOTERS THAT -- AND I THINK OZ WAS THE ONE WHO SAID IT. INSIDE EVERY WOMAN'S DECISION ABOUT HER BODY AND HER PREGNANCY WILL BE A DOCTOR, A WOMAN, AND A LOCAL POLITICIAN I MEAN EVERY NOW AND THEN REPUBLICANS LET SLIP WHAT THEY REALLY BELIEVE AND YOU CAN EXTEND THEIR PUTTING GOVERNMENT IN THE ROOM FOR VOTING I MEAN, THEY WANT TO DECIDE WHOSE VOTES COUNT, THEY WANT TO DECIDE WHO COUNTS THE VOTES. YOU CAN PUT THE REPUBLICAN GRAB AWAY FROM FREEDOM AND ANTI-DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES ACROSS JUST ABOUT EVERY DEBATE GOING ON IN THIS COUNTRY. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE OPPORTUNITY BEFORE DEMOCRATS RIGHT NOW TO REALLY EXPAND THEIR COALITION.  WELL, IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE, BECAUSE AS YOU SAY, INDEPENDENCE REALLY SAVED DEMOCRATS IN THIS CYCLE. BUT ONE OF THE CONCERNING METRICS THAT I HEARD THE OTHER DAY WAS THAT IN NEW YORK, FOR EXAMPLE, DEMOCRATS ARE THE LARGEST VOTING BLOC, BUT INDEPENDENTS ARE NOW THE SECOND BIGGEST VOTING BLOC, OUTNUMBERING REPUBLICANS IN THIS STATE. WHICH SUGGESTS NOT ONLY HAVE IN MANY WAYS REPUBLICANS TURNED OFF A LOT OF VOTERS, THAT IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DEMOCRATS TO ALSO COME IN AND SAY HERE YOUR CHOICE HERE IS A CHOICE BETWEEN DEMOCRACY AND A CHOICE BETWEEN OR LIES. HERE IS A CHOICE BETWEEN MOVING FORWARD OR A CHOICE MOVING BACKWARD AND, LOOK, I AM A COUPLE OF WEEKS AWAY FROM MY 51st BIRTHDAY A PROUD CARRIER OF AN AARP CARD, BY THE WAY I WOKE UP RUN MORNING AND REALIZED THAT SO MUCH OF WHAT I HAD TAKEN FOR FRGRANTED FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE ARE RIGHT, OPPORTUNITIES, WHETHER IT'S BEING ABLE TO CAST MY VOTE OR ABORTION RIGHTS, REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS SO MANY OF THOSE THINGS WERE UNDER FIRE IN AN AMERICA THAT I THOUGHT WE HAD LONG SINCE PASSED AND I THINK FOR VOTERS, THEY HAVE WOKEN UP AND SAID WELL, IF IT CAN GO THAT QUICKLY, MAYBE I SHOULD GET INVOLVED. MAYBE I SHOULD BE ENGAGED. AND OVER THESE LAST FEW YEARS WHEN WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT THE POWERS OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE, IT'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE CIVICS LESSON FOR THE COUNTRY TO SAY THESE RACES MATTER ELECTIONS MATTER ALL OF THESE SEATS SHOULD BE CONTESTED. AND WE NEED TO HEAR MORE FROM OUR CANDIDATES AND OUR LEADERS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO BECAUSE ALL OF THE SUDDEN, THINGS WE REALIZE HOW QUICKLY THINGS CAN CHANGE. SOMETHING WE'VE TAKEN FOR GRANTED, EVEN BEEN COMPLACENT ABOUT CAN CHANGE A GUY IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW, GEORGE SANTOS WHOSE ENTIRE RESUME IS A WORK OF FICTION, AND HE WAS ELECTED TO CONGRESS AND THERE ARE VERY FEW WAYS NOW TO KEEP HIM FROM TAKING HIS SEAT THAT CANNOT CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AND I THINK MORE AND MORE OF US ARE BECOMING AWARE OF IT  WELL, AND I MEAN, JUST TO THE POINT, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL MAKE A SPACE, A SPOT, PROBABLY A FRONT ROW SEAT FOR SOMEONE WHO'S ENTIRE RESUME WAS FABRICATED BECAUSE IT'S NOT EVEN THE WORST SIN COMMITTED BY THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL CAUCUS I'M GOING ASK YOU TO STICK AROUND UP NEXT FOR US, DEMOCRATS GOING ON THE OFFENSE ON ONE OF THE CENTRAL ISSUES TO OUR DEMOCRACY, SOMETHING WE'VE COVERED A WHOLE LOT HERE, AND THAT IS VOTING RIGHTS THAT STORY IS NEXT 20221227225011.570|20221227225320.859",

BIDEN HAS VISITED THE VIRGIN ISLANDS IN THE PAST, BUT THIS WILL BE HIS FIRST TRIP THERE AS A SITTING PRESIDENT. ELISE?  IN MINNESOTA, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CONTROLS BOTH CHAMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE, SO GOVERNOR TIM WALZ IS ASKING DEMOCRATS TO, QUOTE, THINK BIG WHEN IT COMES TO VOTING ISSUES AND OTHER REFORMS THE PARTY IS HOPING TO PUT INTO ACTION. JOINING US NOW, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF MINNESOTA, TIM WALZ. GOVERNOR, IT'S AN EXCITING TIME FOR DEMOCRATS IN MINNESOTA FIRST TIME IN EIGHT YEARS YOU'VE CONTROLLED BOTH CHAMBERS HOW DO YOU PLAN TO USE THIS NEW POWER?  WELL, GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE, AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING US. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO USE IT TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF MINNESOTANS. THEY SPOKE CLEARLY IN THIS ELECTION, ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE PROUD OF IN MINNESOTA IS WE RANK AT OR NEAR THE TOP IN VOTER TURNOUT IN EVERY ELECTION, AND PROTECTING THAT ACCESS TO THE BALLOT WITH, YOU KNOW, AUTOMATIC VOTER REGISTRATION, PREREGISTRATION FOR OUR 16- AND 17-YEAR-OLDS, RESTORATION OF VOTING RIGHTS AND USING SOME OF THE MONEY. WE'VE BEEN STOPPED BY REPUBLICANS FROM USING IT. AND MOVING ON TO PEOPLE SEE UNDER THREAT, REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, ABORTION ACCESS FOR WOMEN, AND WE'LL MAKE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION TO MAKE THIS THE BEST STATE MANY THE COUNTRY TO RAISE YOUR FAMILY AND HAVE A CHILD THOSE ARE THINGS I THINK FOLKS SPOKE CLEARLY ABOUT. IT'S NOT ABOUT DEMOCRATS HAVING POWER AND DOING WHATEVER WE WANT IT'S MOVING THINGS FORWARD THAT PEOPLE ASK FOR THAT HAVE BEEN INSTALLED. SO IT IS AN EXCITING TIME.  THE GOVERNOR, THE HEADLINE OF \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" ARTICLE SAYS THAT DEMOCRATS ARE GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE WITH VOTING RIGHTS IN WISCONSIN HOW SPECIFICALLY DO YOU PLAN TO GO ON THE OFFENSIVE?  YEAH. I THINK YOU SEE THIS AS I SAID, MINNESOTA HAS A LONG TRADITION, BIPARTISAN TRADITION, BY THE WAY WE DON'T FEAR THE VOTERS HOWEVER VOTERS VOTE WE RESPECT THAT WE'VE SEEN THIS ATTACK ON OUR ELECTIONS. AN INCREDIBLE SECRETARY OF STATE THAT KEEPS MINNESOTA WITH SAFE, FAIR ELECTIONS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE ROLLING BACK OF THIS, YOU KNOW, STATES AROUND US MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GET WATER WHILE THEY'RE VOTING IT'S RIDICULOUS TO PEOPLE HERE PIM THINK AGAIN WE HAVE SAME-DAY REGISTRATION BUT WE NEED TO PREREGISTER AND MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S THERE. WE NEED MORE ACCESS USING SOME OF THOSE FEDERAL DOLLARS IN OUR STATE SURPLUS TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE PLENTY OF VOTING PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE WE KNOW VOTE BY MAIL IS SECURE AND SAFE, AND WHEN YOU'RE IN A STATE LIKE MINNESOTA, THE WEATHER IS UNPREDICTABLE AS WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY, JUST THINGS TO EXPAND ACCESS TO THE BALLOT, LETTING PEOPLE VOTE, AND HOWEVER THEY CHOOSE TO VOTE, THAT IS THEIR RIGHT TO DO. BUT THIS IDEA OF WE'RE SEEING IN OTHER STATE WHERE IS THERE'S THIS ATTEMPT TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VOTE, IN MINNESOTA WE WANT TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE WE KNOW OUR ELECTIONS ARE SAFE, SECURE, AND FAIR WE'LL LEAN INTO THAT, COLD FI THAT, AND PUT UP A FIRE WALL BECAUSE THIS ATTACK ON VOTING RIGHTS IS AN ATTACK ON THE BASIC CORE OF DEMOCRACY AND NEEDS TO END.  I AGREE WITH YOU, GOVERNOR. YOU SAY YOU WANT FOLKS TO GO BIG. WHAT IS THE LESSON YOU'RE SENDING TO THE NATIONAL PARTY? WE KNOW THAT VOTING RIGHTS HAVE STALLED IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO MUCH WITH THAT, SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO THE NATIONAL PARTY LEADERS AS YOU GO BIG IN MINNESOTA AROUND THE VOTING RIGHTS ISSUE  I SAY THAT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING FOR A DOZEN YEARS IN CONGRESS WITH JOHN LEWIS, HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS, WENT WITH JOHN TO SELMA AND LISTENED TO SOME OF THOSE THINGS AND UNDERSTANDING THIS IS A CRITICAL TIME IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY WE WATCH PEOPLE ERODE THAT BASIC RIGHT. I THINK NOW IF WE CAN'T GET IT FEDERALLY, STATES NEED TO TAKE THE LEAD WE SAW THAT WITH THE DECISION ON ROE. I DON'T THINK THE SUPREME COURT IS DONE. I THINK NOW WHILE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH FOLK WHO IS CARE ABOUT THE DEMOCRACY, CARE ABOUT ACCESS TO ABORTION, CARE ABOUT PUBLIC SCHOOLS, CAREORGANE THAT IF ANYTHING REPUBLICANS HAVE TAUGHT ME, WE HAVE A SLIM MAJORITY IN THE SENATE, BUT REPUBLICANS ALWAYS TOLD ME A ONE-VOTE MAJORITY IS A MAJORITY. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING NOW DEMOCRATS WHO CARE ABOUT THIS. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THIS STATE MORE HOSPITABLE FOR PEOPLE TO COOL HERE AND TEACH IF THEY WANT TO TEACH, TO START BUSINESSES. WE HAVE A STRONG BUSINESS CLIMATE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT SOME STRANGE IDEOLOGY THAT WE HAVE. THESE ARE BASIC AMERICAN TEN ELTS OF ACCESS TO THE VOTE, ACCESS TO PUBLIC EDUCATION, ACCESS TO MAKING YOUR OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS AND I JUST THINK FOR US TO -- YOU KNOW, I COME FROM A RURAL DISTRICT THAT I SERVED IN CONGRESS I'M WILLING TO COMPROMISE. I'M NOT GOING TO COMPROMISE ON THE BALLOT I'M NOT GOING TO COMPROMISE ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS I'M NOT GOING TO COMPROMISE ON PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND I THINK WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE STATES ARE GOING TO BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF THAT I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT MY GOOD FRIEND GRETCHEN WHITMER IS IN THE SAME SITUATION WE ARE BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THIS IN STATE WHERE IS WE HAVE INCREDIBLE GOVERNORS LIKE TONY EVERS IN WISCONSIN, THEY HAVE TO FIGHT AGAINST SOME OF THE MOST BASIC THINGS MY MESSAGE NATIONALLY IS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE AGREE WITH THIS. WE SCRATCH OUR HEADS, PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING AROUND SAFE GUN LEGISLATION. IT PULLS OUT THE ROOF, YET NOTHING HAPPENS. I THINK STATES, WHEN THEY'RE IN AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A CHANGE, NEED TO GO BOLD.  MR. GOVERNOR, I WAS GOING TO GO ON THAT VERY TOPIC. DEMOCRATS WANTED TO GO BIG ON THE IDEA OF GUN SAFETY YOUR STATE TOUCHED BY THIS JUST A FEW DAYS AGO THE MALL OF AMERICA, THE FAMOUS MALL IN MINNESOTA.  YES  FIVE PEOPLE WRP ARRESTED IN A FATAL SHOOTING THERE THAT SENT THE MALL, THE NATION'S LARGEST, INTO LOCKDOWN FOR HOURS ON THE EVE OF A HOLIDAY  YES  MEMBERS OF THE NEW YORK GIANTS WERE THERE AND HAD TO SHELTER IN PLACE FOR A FEW HOURS. WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE ON THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL?  I WAS IN THE VERY STORE YESTERDAY WITH MY TWO CHILDREN, 21 AND 16, AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IT, HOW OUTRAGEOUS IT IS I SERVED 24 YEARS IN THE MILITARY I HAVE FIRED THESE WEAPONS I KNOW WHEN THERE'S A PLACE FOR THEM IT'S THE BATTLEFIELD I'M ALSO A LIFELONG HUNTER I'M A PHEASANT HUNTER. IT'S MY THING. I GREW UP DOING, IT'S CULTURAL, ALL THAT BUT THE COMMONSENSE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER IT'S MAKING SURE WE'RE DOING GOOD BACKGROUND CHECKS, MAKING SURE WE HAVE RED-FLAG LAWS, THOSE THINGS DON'T IMPEDE YOUR LAWFUL RIGHTS TO OWN FIREARMS, BUT THERE ARE TOO MANY GUNS ON THE STREET WHEN WE WE HAVE 17- AND 18-YEAR-OLDS WITH GUNS ON THE STREET, THESE TYPES OF THINGS DON'T HAPPEN IN THE SAME NUMBER THEYS DO ELSEWHERE, AND PEOPLE HAVE THE FREEDOMS TO DO THINGS IN OTHER COUNTRIES WE NEED TO GET THIS FIXED. I COME FROM A RURAL AREA, FROM A CULTURE OF HUNTING AND SERVING IN THE MILITARY. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO ARGUMENT TO BE MADE THAT YOU NEED THESE WEAPONS OF WAR AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE RESTRICTIONS AGAINST THEM AGAIN, WE MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR AN 18-YEAR-OLD TO REGISTER TO VOTE, BUT THEY CAN BUY AN AR WITH NO BACKGROUND CHECK, IT'S RIDICULOUS WE'RE NOT IMMUNE TO THIS IT SHAKES US WE ARE TRADITIONALLY A VERY SAFE STATE, BUT WE'VE SEEN A RISE IN VIOLENCE, ESPECIALLY GUN VIOLENCE, AND WE'LL PUT MONEY INTO THE THINGS THAT STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING BUT I GET -- YOU KNOW, IT'S IRRITATING TO ME WHEN I HEAR REPUBLICANS SAY WELL, YOU KNOW, IT'S A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WE HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH, AND MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE NOT VIOLENT IT'S GUN PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

        "trs": " ONE OF RADICAL RIGHT-WING SUPREME COURT OVERTURNED 5 YEARS OF PRESIDENT AND THE DECISION TO STRIKE DOWN TH ABORTION PROTECTIONS OF ROE V. WADE, LET'S DECISION THA IMMEDIATELY STRIPPED AWA HEALTH CARE FOR MILLIONS O PEOPLE ACROSS THE U.S., AND TH CONSEQUENCES OF THE DECISION CONTINUED TO REVERBERATE AROUN THE COUNTRY. THE MONUMENTAL DECISION IS REALLY ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG WHEN IT COMES TO THI CORRUPT COURT. -- CLASSIC CONSERVATIVE JUSTICE BETTER HISTORY MAKING AN INTEN ON MAKING MORE HISTORY IN TH WORST WAY. I WANT TO BRING IN MAYA WYLIE, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY -- ANGEL WEISMAN, WHO SERVED AS A LEAD PROSECUTOR IN SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE - AND CHARLES COLEMAN, FORME SENIOR ASSISTANT TO TH DISTRICT ATTORNEY IN BROOKLYN. GREAT HAVE YOU ALL HERE. I THINK THE SINGLE BIGGEST POLITICAL ACTOR THIS YEAR WA THE COURT, WITH THE DOBB DECISION THAT OVERTURNED PRESIDENT. BOTH FOR WHAT IT MEANT IMMEDIATELY, AND AWAY I'VE NEVER QUITE SEEN A COURT DECISION IN MY LIFETIME FROM MONDAY TO TUESDAY, YOU HAV THESE RIGHTS, THEN YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE RIGHTS. YOU CAN OBTAIN AN ABORTION, YO CAN'T OBTAIN AN ABORTION AND ALSO, THE POLITICAL -- WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT?  I THINK YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AND AS WE ARE JUST SAYING, BECAUSE IT ALSO MADE CLEAR THA OTHER FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS COMING THAT THERE WAS A GAME PLAN AND THEN, MAKING CLEAR THAT NO ONLY ARE WE GONNA TAKE FRO MORE THAN HALF THE POPULATION, BY THE WAY, WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN, BUT WE'RE ACTUALL GONNA SIGNAL THIS AS A WAY I WHICH WE'RE GONNA BEHAVE AROUN FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS IN GENERAL. REMEMBER, THIS IS THE FIRS TIME THE SUPREME COURT HAS TAKEN AWAY A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT THAT IS RECOGNIZED FOR DECADES AND WE'VE ACTUALLY BEE WATCHING THIS MARCH FORWARD AN OTHER CASES SINCE DOBBS.  GO AHEAD.  MY AUNT, THE THING -- MORE COMING AS SOMETHING THA I'D TIED TO A LARGER CONVERSATION AROUND TH SECURING OF DEMOCRACY. I THINK IT'S VERY INTERESTIN FOR AS MUCH CONVERSATION AS WE HAD DURING MIDTERMS THIS YEA ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS T SECURE DEMOCRACY, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEGLECTED TO TI INTO THAT CONVERSATION WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF LOOKING AT THE SUPREME COURT, AND WHAT WA GOING ON THERE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, DEMOCRACY IS ONLY AS SECURE AS OUR FAITH IN THE INSTITUTION THAT UPHOLD IT, AND THE SUPREM COURT BEING AN EXAMPLE OF THAT AS SOMETHING THAT WE COMPLETEL OVERLOOKED IN THAT DISCUSSION.  THIS IS THE THING I'M SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP BECAUSE THAT GUARDRAIL HAS HEL TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. RIGHT? WHEN TRUMP WAS FLOODING TH COURTS WITH NONSENSE, IT WEN NOWHERE. RECENTLY, WE HAD ANOTHER TES CASE WITH JUDGE CANNON'S, YO KNOW, LARGELY VIEW TO BE LAWLESS ORDER GIVING ESSENTIALLY DONALD TRUMP SPECIAL TREATMENT, TAKING AWAY CRIMINAL EVIDENCE, - NO CRIMINAL DEFENDANT ANYWHERE IN HISTORY HAS EVER GOTTEN FOR ANY REASON, OVERRULED -- NOT AN APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT. BUT HERE'S THE THING, TO YOU POINT, CHARLES WHAT'S SO SCARY IS THAT IT'S LAKE, YOU JUST NEED FIVE BRAIN WARM FOLKS ON THE SUPREME COUR WHO ARE JUST INGESTING THE WORST MEDIA IN THE UNIVERSE TO GO ALONG WITH IT, AND THEN THAT'S THE LAW, AND. YOU AS SOMEONE WHO'S DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO THE LAW, HOW DO YO GET UP IN THE MORNING -- I'M SERIOUS! I THINK ABOUT THE LAW IN THOSE TERMS?  LOOK, I'VE REVIEWED THI WHEN BUSH V. GORE, WHERE THA DECISION - VERY HARD TO SORT OF WAKE UP T THE NEXT DAY AND SAY, OH - LAWYER IN A FUNCTIONING COURT. I KNOW JUDGES HAD THE SAME VIEW, WHICH IS HOW TO ACTUALLY D THIS WHEN THE SUPREME COURT IS NOT A MODEL OF THE RULE OF LAW I DO THINK HERE ORIGINAL POINT THERE'S AN IRONY HERE, WHICH I YOU HAVE DOBBS CAME OUT, YOU HAD JUSTICE THOMAS, TWO POINT, SIGNALING THAT THIS IS STEP ONE, BECAUSE HE'S BASICALLY SAYIN THERE'S NO REASON THAT ALL O THESE THINGS SHOULDN'T B REVERSED BUT YOU HAVE THE POLITICAL B ACTION SO, YES, IT ONLY TAKES FIVE, A JUSTICE O'CONNOR USED TO SAY WITH THE SUPREME COURT ABOUT IT'S FIVE. YOU JUST HAVE TO GET TO THAT NUMBER BUT IF THEY CONTINUE DOWN THIS ROAD, THERE IS A SORT OF REA POTENTIAL POLITICAL SILVER LINING, WHICH WE SAW IN TH MIDTERMS  YEAH. I WANT TO JUST RAISE THI ISSUE. BECAUSE I THINK THE ONLY ANSWE -- YOU CAN GET TO THIS PLACE OF IMPOTENT - ABOUT THE COURT. BECAUSE HONESTLY, I DON'T THIN THE VOTES ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE COURT I DON'T THINK SO THAT MIGHT CHANGE OVERTIME, BU WHEN YOU THINK THIS, LOOK AT THE APPROVAL REIGNING IN THE U.S. SUPREME COURT, ITS RECORD HIGH DISAPPROVAL RATING. THEY REALLY ARE LOST A LOT O PEOPLE THIS YEAR I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE GETTIN BACK THOSE OF, I THINK, A REA CHANGE IN HOW LIBERALS VIEW TH COURT, WHICH I THINK BECAUSE O THE -- THEY'VE VIEWED AT IT A FUNDAMENTALLY AN ENTITY THAT WAS PROTECTED, EVEN -- HOW DO YOU THINK, MAYA, ABOU THE WORLD OF POLITICS IN CIVIL SOCIETY AS CHECKS ON THE COURT  SO, ONE WAY IS THAT - AND YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT, CHRIS, THAT FOR EXAMPLE, CONSERVATIVE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON ELECTIONS BECAUSE THEY CAN CONTROL THE COURTS  AS A MEANS TO AN END.  AS A MEANS TO THAT END. THEY SEE IT AS POWER, AND THEN THINK ABOUT THE POLITICS AS WAY OF GETTING THE POWERS OF THE COURT. AND THAT IS NOT BEEN TRUE FO THE MOST PART, FOR A LOT O DEMOCRATIC VOTERS. I THINK THAT HAS SHIFTED, AN THAT APPROVAL RATING IS ON ELEMENT OF IT. AND EVEN FOR MODERATES, BECAUS I THINK THE CLEAR MESSAGE IS THAT YOU CAN HAVE IDEOLOGY ON COURT WHERE THE EXPECTATION WA RULE OF LAW. AND THAT IS A SHIFT THAT PEOPL -- BECAUSE THEY SEE IT AND WE'L TIME -  THE OTHER THING ABOUT IT, ANNOUNCING LIKE YOU SAID BEFORE, ANNOUNCED IN DOBBS, THERE'S TH RIGHT THING, AND THEN THERE' THIS SORT OF META ISSUE ABOU PRECEDENT. THIS TO ME IS THE OTHER BI THING. THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES TH SUPREME COURT DIFFERENT IN A FUNCTIONAL SENSE FROM LEGISLATURE OF MINE IS THEY AR BOUND BY SOMETHING OTHER THAN, WELL, NOW KEVIN MCCARTHY RUN THE HOUSE. YESTERDAY, NANCY PELOSI RAN. THAT'S HOW LEGISLATORS WORK AN ITS DEMOCRACY. BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU WHOLESALE THROW THAT OUT CHARLES, YOU CAN'T PRETEND T MEAN WHAT YOU'RE DOING ANYTHIN OTHER THAN LEGISLATING  YOU ARE CORRECT IT IS INTERESTING, M PROFESSORS WOULD OFTEN SAY THE SUPREME COURT IS NOT LAS BECAUSE THEY ARE ALWAYS RIGHT, THEY ARE ALWAYS LAST THAT IS THE THING THAT PEOPL HAVE TO REMEMBER WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT IT FRO ANY SORT OF OVERALL SENSE OF JUDGMENT, A PLACE OF JUDGMEN IN TERMS OF THE DECISION THA BEING MADE YOU ARE ON POINT WHEN YOU SAY, WITHOUT THE NOTION OF PRESIDEN BEING ADHERE TO. WE ARE THROWING THAT OUT IT TAKES THE RAILS OFF THE ENTIRE THING I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS, ZOO EVEN FOR THE BACK, THIS IS GOING TO CAUSE US TO DO -- WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT, A AN ELECTORATE, WHERE WE GO FRO HERE LOOK AT OUR ELECTED OFFICIAL AND SAY, FROM A POLICY SPACE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO PROTECT US? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CODIF THIS  IF THE COURT IS GOING TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVE STARTING TO DO, HOW CAN I COUN ON YOU TO PROTECT ME FROM THEM  I DO YOU THINK IT I COMPLICATED BECAUSE, THERE ARE DECISIONS BY THE SUPREME COURT WHERE THEY SAY, WE MADE MISTAKE. THEY DO REVERSE THEMSELVES YOU CAN'T JUST SAY, EVERY TIME THEY DON'T UPHOLD STARE DECISI AND SAY, WE ARE JUST GOING T ADHERE TO IT HERE, THERE ARE TWO THINGS ONE, SUCH AN ABRUPT SHIFT WITH THE PERSONAL CHANGES DO NOT PASS GO, JUST OFF YOU GO, FEELS LIKE HE HAS GOT HIS FIVE HE'S GOING TO DO WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO. THAT IS THE SUBSTANCE OF THE DECISION WHEN YOU OVERRULE ROE V. WAD AND PEOPLE WHO SPENT 50 YEAR WITH THAT AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT REACTION IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT STAR DECISIS OR NOT, IT'S REALL MUCH MORE A REACTION TO WHAT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE DECISIO IS RATHER THAN THIS.  I WANT EVERYONE TO STIC AROUND NEXT, I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMEROUS LEGAL ISSUE FACING THE DISGRACED E PRESIDENT. WHERE IT ALL STANDS AND WHAT I GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN 2023 WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. 20221227014726.308|20221227014938.141",

DONNY IS HERE TO TAKE US THROUGH THEM ALL YIKES, A LOT OF BRAND DOWNS.

HE HAS THE BRANDING. OUT A EVER BEEN OVER TO HI PLACE, BUT HE HAS TH SUPERCOMPUTER, THE BRANDIN SUPERCOMPUTER. WE GO TO THIS GUY TO FIGURE OU WHO IS UP AND WHO IS DOWN AN WHY.  THERE ARE ABOUT 27 DANISH SCIENTISTS WHO ARE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK - I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE DANISH, BUT THEY JUST SOMEHOW GO TOGETHER THEY WORK WITH A SUPERCOMPUTER THEY USE THE GOOGLE MACHIN ALSO THEY DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS AS YOU SAID, A LOT OF THESE AR -- A LOT OF TIMES WE DO THIS ON DAILY BASIS. I JUST DO FUNNY THINGS LIK VELVET ARE TYNICE. WHEN WE LOOK AT A YEAR, WE HAV TO DO SOME OF THE THINGS WHICH ARE BASICALLY DAY-TO-DAY STALWARTS OF MORNING JOE AND THINGS WE TALK ABOUT IN A YEAR AND WRAP UP, IT WOUL BE NEGLIGENT NOT TO DO IT.  WE KNOW HE SERIOUS. HE'S GOT THE DOUBLE BREASTED BLAZER  DREAMS?  IT'S GAME DAY EVEN THE CHOICE OF THE DOUBL BREASTED BLAZER, THE DANIS SCIENTISTS INTO THEIR LA JACKETS, IN THEIR LAB COATS AR THE ONES WHO TOLD HIM TO WEA THAT THAT'S ALL WE'RE GOING TO SA ABOUT THE DANISH SCIENTISTS. WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE I WANT TO START WITH DONAL TRUMP. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE WHICH I OBVIOUS. IT NEEDS TO BE DONE. I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH REMARKABLE SIX YEARS, AN EXTRAORDINARY SIX YEARS. IT SEEMS THAT THE TRUMP ERA IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE DONALD TRUMP OBVIOUSLY - LET'S START WITH THE BRAND DOWN  IN THE HISTORY OF POLITIC OR CULTURE, ANY BRAND THAT HAS GONE FROM 60 TO 0 FASTER AND I A MORE STUNNING FASHION. WE COULD PROBABLY -- BRANDS HAVE ABSOLUTE I COULD GIVE 25 BRAN ATTRIBUTES EVERYTHING FROM STEALING A DOCUMENT TO HIM ENJOY SEEING EVERY LOSIN CANDIDATE TO HIS POLL NUMBER TO THE JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE THIS BUSINESS WAS FOUND IN A - EVERY SINGLE JUDGMENT MADE AGAINST HIM. HE HAD DINNER WITH WHITE SUPREMACY CYSTS AND I SAW MY HE SAID WE SHOULD ALL OF THE CONSTITUTION IT'S JUST ANALYSTS IT'S COMPLETELY ENDLESS. THERE'S NO BRAND MORE DOWN I OUR CULTURE. THE LATEST POLL NUMBERS WE ARE SEEING WITHIN 20 POINTS BEHIND DESANTIS KIND OF SAY THAT TH PEOPLE HAVE FIGURED OUT.  THAT'S SHOWING UP IN TH POLLS. THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S BRANDON  I'VE BEEN CRITICAL OF HIM SAYING HE DOESN'T NECESSARIL HAVE HIS MOJO. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PUR BLOCKING AND ATTACKING, TH LEGISLATIVE VICTORIES, WHETHER IT'S THE CHIPS, MANUFACTURING, GUN CONTROL, CLIMATE, BUIL BACK BETTER, THE INFLATION ACT NO PRESIDENT HAS GOTTEN MORE DOWN IN HIS FIRST TERM SINCE FDR. YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS IN TERMS O HIS COATTAILS OR THE NEGATIV COATTAILS OF DONALD TRUMP AS FAR AS THE WAY THE DEMOCRATS OUTPERFORMED UNDER THE GUISE OF A BRAND O QUIET CONFIDENCE, OF SANITY, O STABILITY, YOU HAVE TO GIVE HI A MAJOR BRAND UP I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU'R COMING FROM.  WHAT IS SO FASCINATING IS THAT - WE SEE THIS ONCE IN AWHILE JOE BIDEN SUPERPOWER POLITICALLY IS ALWAYS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED I REMEMBER WRITING A COLUMN IN THE WASHINGTON POST. EVERYONE THOUGHT HE WA FINISHED AFTER IOWA AND NE HAMPSHIRE. NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I AM PROUD OF JOE BIDEN HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED ON TWITTER GOING INTO THE 202 CAMPAIGN THERE WERE PEOPLE ALL AROUND BARACK OBAMA THAT DID NOT WANT HIM TO RUN THEY WOULD TALK TO ANY REPORTE OFF THE RECORD THEY COUL TALKING ABOUT HOW HE WAS NOT U TO THE JOB YOU HEARD A LOT OF THE SAME TO FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY GOIN INTO THE MIDTERMS AGAIN SAYING THAT THIS GUY WAS TAKING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DOWN AN NEEDED TO QUIT ONCE AGAIN, BRAND UP, HE ALWAY BEATS EXPECTATIONS  DEMOCRATS DID NOT KNOW WHAT THEY HAD IN JOE BIDEN. THEY HAD SOMEONE WHO WAS A SKILLED POLITICIAN WHO MAD MISTAKES ALONG THE WAY, ALON DECADES, WHO HAS LEARNED FRO THEM, AND HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE CARED ABOUT IT WAS ABORTION AND DEMOCRACY. LIKE A LASER, HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ANYONE. PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO CAMPAIGN NEXT TO HIM. USE YOUR EYES.  ISN'T IT FUNNY? HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED. YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS WHO WOULD NOT SAY WHETHER THEY THOUGHT H SHOULD RUN AGAIN OR NOT IN COMPETITIVE DEMOCRATIC RACES IT WAS CRAZY  THEY'RE STILL SAYING THAT THEY'RE STILL NOT SURE DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE BEAT DONALD TRUMP WANTS AND HAD THIS RUN I THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. LET'S KEEP MOVING. BRAND UP TO FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS  YEAH, THE LATEST POLL - ONGOING TO HEDGE THIS BECAUS HE BRANDED IT UP WITH TH SUCCESS HE HAS I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE HI BRAND VERY MUCH. I THINK HE HAS A LOT O DANGEROUS ATTRIBUTES LOOK, I MEAN, THIS IS A GUY WH HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO THE DANC WITH TRUMP AND NOT NECESSARILY INDOOR SIMBA NOT NECESSARILY COME AFTER HIM AT SOME POINT IN TIME, THE RUBBER IS GOING TO HIT THE ROAD IN THE LATEST POLLS, WE SAW HI 20 POINTS AHEAD OF TRUMP, WHIC IS AMAZING HE WON OVERWHELMINGLY IN FLORIDA. HE SEEMS TO BE A FAIR HAIRED BOY. HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG. MY CHINK IN THE ARMOR IS I THINK THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME WHEN HE JUST COMES UP AND SAYS WE NEED TO WIN, GUYS IT'S ABOUT WINNING I'M GOING TO STAND FOR A LOT O THE SAME THINGS THAT YOU'RE GU STANDS FOR, BUT WE'RE DOING IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY WE'RE TAKING THE VITRIOL OUT HE CLEARLY IS THE FUTURE OF TH PARTY. LET'S PUT A BUCK ON THIS GUYS HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS ON THE SHOW WE KIND OF HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ON THE BIG STAGE. WE HAVE NOT SEEN IF HE CAN TAK A PUNCH. WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM UNDER THAT TYPE OF SCRUTINY ON A NATIONAL STAGE. RIGHT NOW, ON HIS YEAR, YO HAVE TO GIVE HIM A MAJOR BRAND UP THIS IS STILL A TBD.  DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES TO FADE THERE WILL BE INCREASING CALLS FOR HIM TO JUMP INTO THE RACE. WE WILL SEE IF HE DOES LET'S KEEP MOVING. LIZ CHENEY THIS YEAR FOR HER WORK ON THE JANUARY 6T COMMITTEE.  YOU KNOW, SHE IS TRULY TH AMERICAN HERO OF THE YEAR AS FAR AS AMERICANS GO. SHE -- IT'S ONE THING TO KIND OF GO OUT ON THE LINE AND STAND UP AND TAKE A STAND IT'S ANOTHER THING WHEN YOU'RE SACRIFICING. THIS IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM WE SEE WHAT REPUBLICANS IF THEY STAND UP, A LOT OF THE LOSE THEIR JOBS. SHE LOST HER JOB SHE WILL BE A POLITICIAN ON TH SCENE FOR DECADES TO COME. I THINK SHE COULD BE PRESIDENTIAL TIMBER IN THE FUTURE I THINK THAT HER BRAND IS AS STRONG AS ANY POLITICAL BRAN OUT THERE. YOU HAVE TO GIVE HER KUDOS SHE PUT ON A STUNNIN PERFORMANCE AT JANUARY 6TH  WE OFTEN HEAR HOW UNDIVIDED THE ELECTRODES MAYBE THEY ARE I BROUGHT UP FAUCI A FEW WEEKS BACK, TALKING ABOUT HO REPUBLICANS KEEP BASHING FAUCI HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON OUT O 15 PEOPLE POLLED IN A RECENT POLL THAT WAS POSITIVE NUMBER TWO, THE ONE CLOSES ANTHONY FAUCI, LIZ CHENEY.  YEAH, SHE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB OVER THE PAST YEAR ESPECIALLY FOR TH COUNTRY. ON THAT FRONT, SOMEONE WHO YOU CAN SAY MIGHT BE DOING THE OPPOSITE IS MARJORIE TAYLO GREENE TO YOUR FEELINGS MATCH REALITY SHE IS ACTUALLY GAINING IN POWER?  SHE'S GAINING EMPOWER I THINK SHE'S GOING TO RUN INT A BUZZSAW. SHE'S COME OUT WITH EVERYTHING FROM, HEY, WE WOULD HAVE WON THAT JANUARY 6TH I WOULD'VE HAD GUNS THERE, THINGS LIKE THAT I JUST THINK THAT WE ARE HEADING INTO A MOMENT OF TIM WHEN THAT TYPE OF VITRIOL, THA TYPE OF HATE, YES, IT GETS YOU ATTENTION, BUT I THINK THE REPUBLICANS HAVE SHOWN THA THEY TALK ABOUT THE LOSING STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLICANS. HER BRAND, SO TO SPEAK, AS FAR AS AWARENESS IN POPULARITY - IT MIGHT BE UP, BUT HER BRAN ON A NATIONAL STAGE, BEING ABL TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MEANINGFUL WAY, IS LIMITED LON TERM I THINK THIS IS HER MOMENT I TIME  BEING SWAY FOR THE MOMENTS. SHE HAS INFLUENCE OVER KEVIN MCCARTHY  THAT'S TRUE KEVIN, YOU NEVER KNOW. FINALLY, DONNY, NANCY PELOSI BRAND UP  YEAH, YOU GUYS SHOWED A COUPLE OF WEEKS, JOHN BOEHNE GETTING UP THERE AND CRYING AS HE TALKED ABOUT IT I DON'T THINK WE'VE HAD AN EFFECTIVE SPEAKER IN M LIFETIME SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT HER, LIKE ARE NOT LIKE OR, THE LEVE OF CONFIDENCE THE WAY SH CAPTURE CAUCUSES IN LINE, TH WAY SHE'S HANDLED HERSELF WITH DIGNITY IN EVERY SINGLE MOMENT SHE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE GREAT SPEAKERS OF ALL-TIME YOU HAVE TO TIP YOUR HAT T NANCY PELOSI  WITHOUT QUESTION. LET'S MOVE ON TO VOTERS. YOU'RE STARTING A BRAND UP WIT INDEPENDENT VOTERS WHY DO YOU SAY THAT  INTERESTING, GALLU RECENTLY ASKED PEOPLE TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. MORE PEOPLE IDENTIFY THEMSELVE AS INDEPENDENTS THAT REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS THE INDEPENDENTS ARE REALLY WH CAME TO BEAR IN THE LAST ELECTION THE INDEPENDENTS, I BELIEVE, MORE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP, SAVED OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY CAME OUT AND SPOKE. I THINK INDEPENDENT AS A BRAND IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW WE ARE A TWO PARTY SYSTEM. MOST PEOPLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR WARDROBE OF ABSOLUTE DON'T LINEUP COMPLETELY INTO EITHER PARTY I THINK INDEPENDENT IS GOING T BE A BIGGER BRAND AS WE MOVE FORWARD.  REPUBLICANS BLUE WHAT SHOUL HAVE BEEN A LAYUP OF A MIDTERM ELECTION I'M GIVING THEM A BRAND DOWN  YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT ENOUGH, WHAT A LOSING STRATEGY THE PARTY OF GRIEVANCES, PARTY OF NOTHING - EVEN AFTER ALL OF THESE LOSSES WHAT DID THEY COME FORWARD WITH? HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP. THE REPUBLICANS ARE LOST THEY CAN'T GET UP. THE PROBLEM THEY HAVE GOIN FORWARD IS THAT DONALD TRUMP ALTHOUGH WE SEE HI DISINTEGRATING AS WELL AS HI POPULARITY, I DON'T SEE HI DISAPPEARING I SEE HIM GOING BACK TO OUR -- JOINING US AS A DIFFERENT KIND OF INDEPENDENT HE STILL HOLDS THAT BASE THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. THEY HAVE A MAJOR BRANDING PROBLEM. I THINK IF YOU POLLED 90% OF REPUBLICANS, THEY WOULD SA THAT WE WANT HIM TO GO AWAY. GOODBYE. THEY ARE STUCK WITH HIM. THEY ARE STUCK WITH HI GRIEVANCE. THEY HAVE A PROBLEM FOR TH FORESEEABLE FUTURE UNLES RHONDA SCENT IS CAN REALLY RESCUE THIS PARTY. THIS PARTY IS IN DEEP, DEE TROUBLE.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT PUTTING IT INTO DANTE STORMS, THEY ARE MICRO TARGETING. THEY KEEP MICRO-TARGETING TO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE BUBBLE THEY KEEP TRYING TO CONVER THOSE WHO ARE ALREAD CONVERTED. THEY ARE TALKING TO THEMSELVES WHEN YOU ARE LOSING THE SUBURBS, WHEN YOU ARE LOSING MIDDLE AMERICA, WHEN YOU'RE LOSIN SWING VOTERS, YOU ARE JUST NOT GOING TO WIN ELECTIONS THEY REMAIN FOCUSED ON MICRO TARGETS. I THINK THAT THE BEST EXAMPL OF THIS WAS ACTUALLY IN ARIZONA, THE FINAL WEEK OF THE MIDTER CAMPAIGN KARI LAKE DECIDED TO ATTAC MCCAIN VOTERS AND SAID THAT IF YOU ARE MCCAIN VOTER YOU SHOUL GET OUT OF HERE. AS A FORMER POLITICIAN, YO HAVE JUST SHUTTERED. YOU WANT EVERY VOTE. YOU WANT EVERYBODY ON YOUR SIDE. THEY KEEP PUSHING PEOPLE AWAY.  THEY DO ANOTHER ISSUE WHERE THEY D THAT IS ABORTION, DONNY. IF YOU LOOK AT POLLS ACROSS TH COUNTRY ON DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS, REPUBLICANS AR SPLIT ON ABORTION. MORE OF THEM ARE FOR WOMEN HAVING THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE HE WOULD EXPECT. ROE V. WADE, BRAND  YEAH, I THINK THIS WAS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE LAST ELECTION. I THINK THIS WAS ONE OF THE GU ISSUES I THINK THIS IS THE TONE DEAFNESS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS WAS A SUPREME COURT DECISION, NOT NECESSARILY THAT OF THE PARTY I THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE T BE A CAUSE CELEB REFER DEMOCRATS. I THINK THIS SPEAKS VOLUME ABOUT GOING THAT WERE I IS GOING FORWARD. THIS IS A BRAND WHICH, AS LONG AS THE REPUBLICANS ARE STUCK WITH THE ANTI ROE V. WADE, THEY'RE BRAND STAYS TARNISH. YOU HAVE TO INTERLOCK THE TW OF THEM.  I HAVE TO SAY THERE ARE - SOME OF THESE THINGS SEE OBVIOUS TO US AS WE TALK ABOUT ROE V. WADE. IT IS SHOCKING THAT AMERICAN WOULD RESPOND AS OVERWHELMINGL AS THEY DID. IF YOU LOOK AT POLLS, IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS, IF YOU LOOK WHERE SWING VOTERS WERE, IT IS VER SURPRISING LOOKING BACK TO SEE JUST HOW DRAMATIC THE BACKLASH WAS. OUR LAST BRAND AUNG IS - IT'S VERY SAFE TO SAY THAT LITERALLY NO ONE WOULD HAV SEEN THIS COMING VLADIMIR PUTIN, BRAND WAY DOWN ZELENSKYY, BRAND WAY UP. NO ONE WOULD HAVE IMAGINED WHE THE TANK STARTED ROLLING IN AN PEOPLE BELIEVE THE UKRAINIAN WOULD COLLAPSE IN THREE, FOUR, FIVE DAYS. NO ONE WOULD BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE WOULD B TALKING AND THIS IS WHERE TH ARROWS WILL BE POINTED A REALLY DRAMATIC HISTORICAL WAY.  YEAH, NOT ONLY PUTIN, I REALLY UNEARTHED AND TOOK TH CLOSE OFF RUSSIA AS FAR AS NOT BEING THE SUPERPOWER IT'S A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY AND SO MANY WAYS IF THEY WOULD CHOOSE SIZE TO B GETTING INTO, WHO ARE YO BETTING ON, IT WOULD BE NO-BRAINER ZELENSKYY HAS BEEN SO PITC PERFECT IN THE WAY HE HA HANDLED THE MEDIA. THIS GOES BACK TO JOE BIDEN AN THE -- I DIDN'T BRING THIS UP WHAT WAS TALKING ABOUT JOE BIDEN, BUT THE NATO COALITION HE PU TOGETHER ZELENSKYY WAS TIME MAGAZINES MAN OF THE YEAR, RIGHTFULLY SO PUTIN IS A DAMAGED, HEAR BRAND. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS EXIT RAM IS ZELENSKYY IS AN INTERNATIONA HERO I THINK TIME MAGAZINE HAD RIGHT.  STILL AHEAD ON THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF BRAND OF, BRANDON DONNY GIVES US THE CHANCE FO SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN BUSINESS, SPORTS, AN ENTERTAINMENT.

AND DONNY DEUTSCH IS HERE TO TAKE US THROUGH THEM ALL. YIKES, A LOT OF BRAND DOWNS. SOME BRAND UPS.  THE THING IS SOME OF THESE ACTUALLY ARE A BIT OBVIOUS, BUT WHAT MAKES IT SO INTERESTING IS WE'VE GOT DONNY HERE, THAT SPECIAL SAUCE, YOU KNOW -- WILLIE, OBVIOUSLY AN ADVERTISING LEGEND, A BRANDING LEGEND. HE'S GOT THE BRANDING, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN OVER TO HIS PLACE --  OH, YEAH.  -- HE'S GOT THE SUPER COMPUTER. WE GO TO THIS GUY TO FIGURE OUT WHO'S UP, WHO'S DOWN, AND WHY.  THERE'S ABOUT 27 DANISH SCIENTISTS WHO ARE WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK --  YES.  I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE DANISH BUT SOMEHOW THEY KIND OF GOT TOGETHER, AND THEY WORK AT THE SUPER COMPUTER. THERE'S A GOOGLE MACHINE ALSO. A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. A LOT OF TIMES WE DO THIS ON A WEEKLY BASIS, I KIND OF DO FUNNY THINGS LIKE VELVEETA MARTINIS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I LOOK AT A YEAR, 25 OF THEM, KIND OF DOING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BASICALLY DAY-TO-DAY STALWARTS OF \"MORNING JOE\" AND THINGS WE TALK ABOUT, BUT IN A YEAR-END WRAP-UP, IT WOULD BE KIND OF NEGLIGENT NOT TO DO IT.  HE'S SERIOUS. HE'S GOT THE DOUBLE-BREASTED BLAZER ON SO IT'S GAME DAY.  IT IS GAME DAY. I WILL TELL YOU, EVEN THE CHOICE OF THE DOUBLE-BREASTED BLAZER, THE DANISH SCIENTISTS IN THEIR LAB JACKETS, IN THEIR LAB KOEMTS WERE THE ONES THAT TOLD HIM TO WEAR THAT. THAT'S ALL WE'RE GOING TO SAY ABOUT THE DANISH SCIENTISTS. WE'LL LEAVE IT THERE. I WANT TO START WITH DONALD TRUMP. AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THAT'S OBVIOUS, BUT IT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY. THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH A REMARKABLE SIX YEARS, AN EXTRAORDINARY SIX YEARS, AND IT SEEMS THAT THE TRUMP ERA IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE. DONALD TRUMP OBVIOUSLY, DONNY, START WITH THE OBVIOUS, BRAND DOWN, RIGHT?  I CAN'T THINK IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS, CULTURE, YOU KNOW, ONE BRAND THAT HAS GONE FROM 60 TO 0 FASTER AND IN A MORE STUNNING FASHION. BRANDS HAVE WHAT WE CALL BRAND-DOWN TRIBUTES. 25 BRAND TRIB UNITS, EVERYTHING FROM STEALING THE DOCUMENTS TO ENDORSING JUST ABOUT EVERY LOSING CANDIDATE TO HIS POLL NUMBERS TO THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE POSSIBLY BRINGING HIM UP ON CRIMINAL CHARGES TORQUE HIS BUSINESS BEING FOUND ON 17 COUNTS, ON EVERY SINGLE JUDGMENT MADE AGAINST HIM, DINNER WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND ANTI-SEMITES, SAYING WE SHOULD THROW OUT THE CONSTITUTION, IT'S COMPLETELY ENDLESS. THERE IS NO BRAND THAT IS MORE DOWN IN OUR CULTURE RIGHT NOW. THE LATEST POLLS WE'RE SEEING WITH HIM 20 POINTS BEHIND DeSANTIS KIND OF SAYS THE PEOPLE FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT.  SHOWING UP IN THE POLLS NOW. CURRENT PRESIDENT, BRAND UP.  YEAH. I OVER THE YEARS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE CRITICAL OF HIM SAYING HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE HIS MOJO OR WHAT NOT, BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PURE LEGISLATIVE VICTORIES, WHETHER IT'S THE CHIPS, WHETHER IT'S MANUFACTURING, WHETHER IT'S GUN CONTROL, WHETHER IT'S CLIMATE, WHETHER IT'S BUILD BACK BETTER, THE INFLATION ACT, NO PRESIDENT HAS GOTTEN MORE DONE IN HIS FIRST TERM PROBABLY SINCE FDR AND YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MIDTERMS, ON HIS COATTAILS OR THE NEGATIVE COATTAILS OF DONALD TRUMP. SO UNDER THE GUISE OF A BRAND OF QUIET COMPETENCY, OF SANITY, OF STABILITY, YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE HIM A MAJOR BRAND UP. I DON'T CARE WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM.  WELL, AND YOU KNOW, MIKA, WHAT'S SO FASCINATING IS -- AND WE SEE THIS ONCE IN A WHILE, BUT JOE BIDEN'S SUPERPOWER POLITICALLY HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED. I REMEMBER WRITING A COLUMN IN \"THE WASHINGTON POST,\" EVERYBODY THOUGHT HE WAS FINISHED AFTER IOWA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, I SAID NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS I'M STILL PROUD OF JOE BIDEN. AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED. HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED ON TWITTER GOING INTO THE 2020 CAMPAIGN. THERE WERE PEOPLE ALL AROUND BARACK OBAMA THAT DIDN'T WANT HIM TO RUN AND THEY WOULD TALK TO ANY REPORTER OFF THE RECORD THEY COULD, TALKING ABOUT HOW HE WAS V HE WASN'T UP TO THE JOB. YOU OF COURSE HEARD A LOT OF THE SAME TALK FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS, AGAIN, SAYING THAT THIS GUY WAS TAKING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DOWN AND HE NEEDED TO QUIT. ONCE AGAIN, BRAND UP, HE ALWAYS, HE ALWAYS BEATS EXPECTATIONS.  DEMOCRATS NEVER AND DIDN'T IN THE MIDTERMS KNOW WHAT THEY HAD IN JOE BIDEN. THEY HAD SOMEONE WHO IS A SKILLED POLITICIAN, WHO'S MADE HIS MISTAKES ALONG THE WAY, ALONG DECADES, WHO'S LEARNED FROM THEM, WHO KNEW EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE CARED ABOUT, DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE POLLS, AND HE STAYED FOCUSED ON TWO ISSUES RIGHT BEFORE THE MIDTERMS, AND IT FEELS -- IT WAS ABORTION AND DEMOCRACY, LIKE A LASER. PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO CAMPAIGN NEXT TO HIM. DEMOCRATS, USE YOUR EYES.  AND WILLIE, HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED, AND YOU HAD DEMOCRATS THAT WOULD NOT SAY WHETHER THEY THOUGHT HE SHOULD RUN AGAIN IN COMPETITIVE DEMOCRATIC RATIONS. IT WAS JUST CRAZY.  YEAH. THEY'RE STILL SAYING IT. THEY'RE STILL NOT SURE IF THEY WANT HIM TO RUN AGAIN DESPITE HE BEAT DONALD TRUMP ONCE AND HAD VICTORY IN THE MIDTERMS. BRAND UP TO FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DeSANTIS.  YEAH. THE LATEST POLLS -- I'M GOING TO CAGE THIS BECAUSE BRAND UP WITH THE SUCCESS HE'S HAD, ALL RIGHT. PERSONALLY, I DON'T LIKE HIS BRAND VERY MUCH. I THINK HE'S GOT A LOT OF DANGEROUS ATTRIBUTES TO HIM. BUT, LOOK, THIS IS THE GUY THAT'S BEEN ABLE TO DO THE DANCE WITH TRUMP AND NOT NECESSARILY IN ANY WAY ENDORSE HIM BUT NOT NECESSARILY KIND OF COME AFTER HIM. AT SOME POINT IN TIME THE RUBBER IS GOING TO HIT THE ROAD. IN THE LATEST POLLS HE'S 20 POINTS AHEAD OF TRUMP, WHICH IS AMAZING. HE WON OVERWHELMINGLY IN FLORIDA. HE SEEMS TO BE THE FAIR-HAIRED BOY. HE HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG. MY CHINK IN THE ARMOR IS I THINK THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME WHERE HE COMES UP AND SAYS WE NEED TO WIN, GUYS, IT'S ABOUT WINNING AND I'M GOING TO STAND FOR A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS THAT YOUR GUY STANDS FOR BUT WE'RE GOING TO DO IT A DIFFERENT WAY, TAKE A LOT OF THE VITRIOL OUT. HE'S CLEARLY THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY, BUT LET'S PUT A \"BUT\" ON THIS, WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ON THE BIG STAGE. WE HAVEN'T SEEN IF HE CAN TAKE A PUNCH, UNDER THE TYPE OF SCRUTINY ON A NATIONAL STAGE. RIGHT NOW ON HIS YEAR, YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM A MAJOR BRAND UP, BUT THIS IS STILL A TBD.  AS DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES TO FADE, THERE WILL BE INCREASING CALLS FOR HIM TO JUMP INTO THIS RACE. WE'LL SEE IF HE DOES IT. BRANDS UP, LIZ CHENEY FOR HER WORK ON THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE.  YEAH. YOU KNOW, SHE'S TRULY I THINK THE AMERICAN HERO OF THE YEAR AS FAR AS AMERICANS GO. SHE LOST HER JOB. IT'S ONE THING TO GO OUT ON A LINE AND STAND UP AND TAKE A STAND. IT'S ANOTHER THING WHEN YOU'RE SACRIFICING. THIS IS THE WHOLE PROBLEM WE SEE WITH REPUBLICANS. NOT ONE OF THEM -- THEY REALIZE IF THEY STAND UP, A LOT OF THEM LOSE THEIR JOB AND SHE LOST HER JOB. SHE WILL BE A POLITICIAN ON THE SCENE FOR DECADES TO COME. SHE COULD BE PRESIDENTIAL TIMBER IN THE FUTURE. BUT I THINK THAT HER BRAND IS AS STRONG AS ANY POLITICAL BRAND OUT THERE, AND YOU'VE GOT TO GIVE HER KUDOS EVERY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM. SHE PUT ON A STUNNING PERFORMANCE FOR JANUARY 6th.  WE OFTEN HEAR HOW DIVIDED THE ELECTORATE IS, MAYBE THEY ARE. I BROUGHT UP ANTHONY FAUCI A FEW WEEKS BACK TALKING ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS KEEP BASHING FAUCI. HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON OUT OF 15 PEOPLE POLLED -- IN A RECENT POLL THAT WAS POSITIVE, NUMBER TWO, THE ONE CLOSEST TO ANTHONY FAUCI, LIZ CHENEY.  YEAH. SHE'S DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB OVER THE PAST YEAR, ESPECIALLY, FOR THE COUNTRY. ON THAT FRONT, SOMEONE YOU COULD SAY MAYBE WAS DOING THE OPPOSITE, DONNY, MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. YOU SAY BRAND DOWN, AND I WONDER, THOUGH, IF YOUR FEELINGS DON'T MATCH REALITY HERE BECAUSE SHE'S ACTUALLY GAINING IN POWER.  SHE'S GAINING IN POWER, BUT I THINK THAT SHE'S GOING TO RUN INTO A BUZZ SAW. SHE'S COME OUT WITH EVERYTHING FROM, HEY, IF I WAS IN CHARGE WE WOULD HAVE WON THAT JANUARY 6th, I WOULD HAVE HAD GUNS THERE AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I JUST THINK THAT THEY ARE HEADING INTO A MOMENT OF TIME WHERE THAT TYPE OF VITRIOL, THAT TYPE OF HATE, YES, IT GETS YOU MEDIA ATTENTION, BUT I THINK AS THE REPUBLICANS, JOE, YOU'VE TALKED SO MANY TIMES ON THE SHOW ABOUT THE LOSING STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLICANS, HER BRAND SO TO SPEAK AS FAR AS AWARENESS AND POPULARITY, A VERY NARROW SEGMENT, BUT HER BRAND ON A NATIONAL STAGE BEING ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY LONG TERM I THINK IS LIMITED. I THINK THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME.  BIG SWING FOR THE MOMENT, THOUGH, RIGHT, MIKA?  RIGHT.  INFLUENCE OVER KEVIN McCARTHY.  OH, MY GOSH, THAT'S TRUE.  YEAH.  NEVER KEVIN, YOU NEVER KNOW. AND FINALLY, DONNY, NANCY PELOSI, BRAND UP.  YEAH. YOU GUYS SHOWED A COUPLE WEEKS, IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO JOHN BOEHNER GETTING UP THERE AND CRYING AS HE TALKED ABOUT HER. I DON'T THINK WE'VE HAD AS EFFECTIVE A SPEAKER IN MY LIFETIME. SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT HER, LIKE HER OR NOT LIKE HER, THE LEVEL OF COMPETENCY, THE WAY SHE KEPT HER CAUCUSES IN LINE, THE WAY SHE'S HANDLED HERSELF WITH DIGNITY IN EVERY SINGLE MOMENT, SHE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE GREAT SPEAKERS OF ALL TIME. YOU HAVE TO TIP YOUR HAT TO NANCY PELOSI.  WITHOUT QUESTION. NOW TO VOTERS. YOU'RE STARTING A BRAND UP WITH INDEPENDENT VOTERS. WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?  MORE PEOPLE IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS INDEPENDENTS THAN THEY DO REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS, AND THE INDEPENDENTS CAME TO BEAR IN THE LAST ELECTION. THE INDEPENDENTS, I BELIEVE, MORE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP, SAVED OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO CAME UP AND SPOKE. AND I THINK INDEPENDENT AS A BRAND IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW. WE ARE NOT -- YES, WE ARE A TWO-PARTY SYSTEM, BUT MOST PEOPLE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR WARDROBE OF ATTRIBUTES, THEY DON'T LINE UP COMPLETELY WE THEY ARE PARTY. I THINK INDEPENDENT IS GOING TO BE A BIGGER BRAND AS WE MOVE FORWARD.  REPUBLICANS BLEW WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LAYUP OF MIDTERM ELECTION SEASON, GIVING THEM A BRAND DOWN.  YEAH. YOU KNOW, JOE, YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT ENOUGH, JUST WHAT A LOSING STRATEGY, THE PARTY OF GRIEVANCE, THE PARTY OF NOTHING, EVEN AFTER ALL OF THESE LOSSES, WHAT DO THEY COME FORWARD WITH? HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP. THE REPUBLICANS ARE LOST. THEY CAN'T GET UP. AND THE PROBLEM THEY HAVE GOING FORWARD IS DONALD TRUMP, ALTHOUGH WE SEE HIM DISINTEGRATING, I SEE HIM GOING BACK FOR A LAST SEGMENT, RUNNING AS AN INDEPENDENT, A VERY DIFFERENT KIND OF INDEPENDENT, AND HE STILL HOLDS THAT BASE. SO THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. THEY HAVE A MAJOR BRANDING PROBLEM. I THINK IF YOU POLLED 90% OF REPUBLICANS THEY'D SAY GOOD-BYE, GOOD. THEY'RE STUCK WITH HIM. THEY'RE STUCK WITH HIS GRIEVANCE. AND THEY HAVE A PROBLEM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. UNLESS RON DeSANTIS CAN REALLY RESCUE THIS PARTY, THIS PARTY IS IN DEEP, DEEP TROUBLE.  AND THE PROBLEM IS, AGAIN, PUTTING IT IN DONNY'S TERMS, THEY'RE MICRO TARGETING. THEY KEEP MICRO TARGETING THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE BUBBLE. THEY KEEP TRYING TO CONVERT THOSE WHO WERE ALREADY CONVERTED. THEY'RE TALKING TO THEMSELVES. AND SO WHEN YOU'RE LOSING THE SUBURBS, WHEN YOU'RE LOSING MIDDLE AMERICA, WHEN YOU'RE LOSING SWING VOTERS, WHEN -- YOU'RE JUST NOT GOING TO WIN ELECTIONS. AND YET THEY REMAIN FOCUSED ON MICRO TARGETING. I THINK THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS ACTUALLY WAS IN ARIZONA, THE FINAL WEEK OF THE MIDTERM CAMPAIGN, OUT IN ARIZONA, KARI LAKE DECIDED TO ATTACK McCAIN VOTERS AND SAID IF YOU'RE A McCAIN VOTER -- AS A FORMER POLITICIAN, YOU JUST SHOULDER. YOU WANT EVERY VOTE. YOU WANT EVERYBODY ON YOUR SIDE. AND YET THEY KEEP PUSHING PEOPLE AWAY.  YES, THEY DO. AND YOU KNOW ANOTHER ISSUE WHERE THEY DO THAT IS ABORTION, DONNY. IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT POLLS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS, REPUBLICANS EVEN ARE SPLIT ON ABORTION, AND MORE OF THEM ARE FOR WOMEN HAVING THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT. ROE V. WADE, BRAND UP.  YEAH. I THINK THIS WAS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE LAST ELECTION THAN POLLS WERE SHOWING. I THINK IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GUT ISSUES. I THINK THIS IS THE TONE DECHNESS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS A SUPREME COURT DECISION SH NOT NECESSARILY THE PARTY'S DECISION, BUT I THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CAUSE CELEBRE FOR DEMOCRATS. THIS IS I THINK ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT'S UNDERNEATH IT THAT JUST SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT GOING BACKWARDS VERSUS GOING FORWARD. THAT IS A BRAND THAT AS LONG AS THE REPUBLICANS ARE STUCK WITH THE ANTI-ROE V. WADE, THE ROLLBACK OF ROE V. WADE, THEIR BRAND STAYS TARNISHED. YOU HAVE TO INTERLOCK THE TWO OF THEM.  WHILE SOME OF THESE THINGS SEEM OBVIOUS TO US NOW AS WE TALK ABOUT ROE V. WADE, IT'S SHOCKING THAT AMERICANS WOULD RESPOND AS OVERWHELMINGLY AS THEY DID IF YOU LOOKED AT POLLS, IF YOU LOOKED AT WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS, IF YOU LOOKED WHERE SWING VOTERS WERE. IT'S VERY SURPRISING LOOKING BACK TO SEE JUST HOW DRAMATIC THE BACKLASH WAS. OUR LAST BRAND UP, BRAND DOWN OF THIS SEGMENT --  GLOBAL.  -- IS GLOBAL. IF YOU GO BACK A YEAR, IT'S VERY SAFE TO SAY LITERALLY NOBODY WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING, EVEN UKRAINES, VLADIMIR PUTIN BRAND WAY DOWN, ZELENSKYY BRAND UP. NOBODY COULD HAVE IMAGINED WHEN THE TANKS STARTED ROLLING IN AND PEOPLE BELIEVES THE UKRAINIANS WOULD COLLAPSE IN THREE, FOUR, FIVE DAYS. NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE WOULD BE TALKING, AND THIS IS WHERE THE ARROWS WOULD BE POINTING IN A REALLY DRAMATIC, HISTORIC WAY, DONNY.  NOT JUST PRESIDENT PUTIN. REALLY UNEARTHED AND TOOKED THE FOCUS OFF RUSSIA IN TERMS OF NOT BEING A SUPER POWER. IT'S THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY IN SO MANY WAYS. IF THEY CHOSE SIDES IN THE BEGINNING, UKRAINE OR RUSSIA, IT WOULD BE A NO-BRAINER. ZELENSKYY HAS BEEN PITCH PERFECT HANDLING THE MEDIA. THIS GOES BACK TO JOE BIDEN, THE NATO COALITION HE PUT TOGETHER, BUT ZELENSKYY WAS \"TIME\" MAGAZINE'S MAN OF THE YEAR, RIGHTFULLY SO. PUTIN IS A DAMAGED, HURT BRAND. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS EXIT RAMP IS OFF, BUT ZELENSKYY IS AN INTERNATIONAL HERO AND I THINK \"TIME\" MAGAZINE HAD IT COMPLETELY RIGHT > STILL AHEAD ON THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF \"BRAND UP, BRAND DOWN,\" DONNY GIVES US THE TRENDS FOR SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN BUSINESS, SPORTS, AND ENTERTAINMENT. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. 20221223143037.835|20221223143428.031",

        "trs": "> WELCOME BACK TO \"MORNING JOE.\" LOOK AT THE WHITE HOUSE. DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE. 7:45 A.M. ON THE EAST COAST AND WASHINGTON, D.C. AND WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH NOW A HISTORY MAKING TERM FOR VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS. IN A NEW INTERVIEW, THE VICE PRESIDENT TALKS ABOUT HER FIRST REACTION TO THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNING ROE. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN FOR HANDLING THE SOUTHERN BORDER AND HER RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRESIDENT. LET'S BRING IN THE AUTHOR OF THAT PIECE, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, AT VANITY FAIR, AND HOST OF THE FAST POLITICS PODCAST, MOLLY JONFAST, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS FOUND WITH BOB DOLE, THERE WAS THIS GREAT DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE PUBLIC IMAGE OF BOB DOLE AND THE PRIVATE GUY THAT YOU TALKED TO BEHIND THE SCENES. I MUST SAY IN ALL MY YEARS, ALL MY DECADES IN WASHINGTON, IN AND OUT OF POLITICS, I GOT TO SAY, THE ONLY OTHER PERSON WHO HAS THAT GREAT OF A DIVIDE IS KAMALA HARRIS, WHO HAS THIS PUBLIC IMAGE OF THIS STILTED, TOUGH, WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT, HOWEVER HER DETRACTORS PAINT HER, THE PUBLIC IMAGE THAT SEEMS TO BE OUT THERE AND THE PRIVATE PERSON WHO IS VERY WARM, FUNNY, RELAXED, REALLY ENGAGING, I'M CURIOUS YOUR IMPRESSIONS WHEN YOU SAT DOWN WITH THE VICE PRESIDENT, AND WHAT YOU LEARNED.  YEAH, I MEAN, I HAD THAT SAME THOUGHT. I WAS LIKE WHY IS SHE TRYING TO MAKE ME FEEL COMFORTABLE. SHE IS THE MOST POWERFUL WOMAN EVER IN THIS COUNTRY, AND SHE'S MAKING SURE I HAVE MY WATER. YEAH, I FOUND HER TO BE VERY ENGAGING AND ALSO JUST VERY FUNNY AND VERY VERSED IN THE ISSUES. REMEMBER, SHE COMES FROM, YOU KNOW, SHE'S A LAWYER. AN AG, SHE'S A VERY SERIOUS PERSON. I MEAN, YOU DON'T GET TO BE THE FIRST AG, THE FIRST FEMALE EAST INDIAN SENATOR, FIRST, YOU KNOW, FEMALE VICE PRESIDENT. YOU DON'T GET TO BE THOSE THINGS. UNLESS YOU ARE VERY VERY VERY, YOU KNOW, PREPARED AND SERIOUS.  MOLLY, I KNOW THE VICE PRESIDENT PRETTY WELL FOR A LONG TIME, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRIKES ME, SHE'S VERY -- AS JOE SAYS, VERY SOCIABLE, VERY KIND. I HAVE TALKED TO HER FACE TIME WHILE SHE WAS COOKING. SHE DOES COOK FOR THE FAMILY. BUT THEN SHE IN THE NEXT MINUTE CAN SAY, I'M NOT GOING THIS FAR IN THIS ISSUE WHERE YOU ARE. I WILL DO THIS. DID YOU FIND THAT KIND OF COMMITTED, SELF-AWARE PERSON THAT KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE, AND AT THE SAME TIME WON'T BE OFFENSIVE ABOUT IT, BUT SHE JUST KNOWS WHO SHE IS, AND WHAT SHE BELIEVES IN?  YEAH, OH, ABSOLUTELY. AND I DO A LOT OF INTERVIEWS FOR MY PODCAST. I'M PRETTY GOOD AT GETTING PEOPLE TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT, AND ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED HER TO TALK ABOUT WAS RON DeSANTIS, AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ABORTION, AND I SAID, WELL, YOU KNOW, RON DeSANTIS HAS THIS SIX-WEEK BILL. AND YOU COULD TELL SHE JUST WASN'T GOING TO GIVE IT TO ME. SHE JUST WENT RIGHT TO THE GOP. SHE'S VERY, VERY ORGANIZED AND, YOU KNOW, VERY GOOD AT BEING PERSONABLE, BUT ALSO BEING FOCUSED AND THAT'S FRUSTRATED AS AN INTERVIEWER BUT VERY USEFUL AS A POLITICIAN.  MOLLY, YOU TALKED TO THE VICE PRESIDENT ABOUT ABORTION AND THE LANDMARK DECISION THIS YEAR OF THE SUPREME COURT. YOU SAID THAT SHE -- YOU ASKED IF SHE WAS SURPRISED AND CAN YOU TALK ABOUT HER RESPONSE AND HOW SHE ENGAGED WITH THAT, BECAUSE WATCHING IT FROM AFAR, IT WAS SURPRISING THAT SOME IN THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE SEEMED SURPRISED BY THE REVERSAL OF ROE AFTER THE LEAKED MEMO.  IT WAS REALLY INTERESTED BECAUSE ONCE SB8, THAT TEXAS LAW THAT BASICALLY OVERTURNED ROE WAS ALLOWED TO STAND, THE SUPREME COURT LOOKED AT IT ON THE NINE MONTHS BEFORE THE LEAKED DECISION AND AT THAT POINT I WAS PRETTY SURE THEY WOULD OVERTURN ROE. I ASKED HER WHEN THAT HAPPENED DID YOU THINK THIS IS IT? IT IS OVER? SHE WAS STILL -- SHE STILL SORT OF HAD THIS BELIEF THAT MAYBE IT WOULD N'T HAPPEN. SHE IS A LAWYER AND SHE KNEW HOW BIG THE STAKES WERE HERE I THINK BUT ONCE SHE GOT THE DRAFT DECISION SHE WAS COMPLETELY I THINK ALL SO SHOCKED. 50 YEARS OF PRECEDENCE DOWN IS SO SHOCKING BUT I HAD HEARD THAT WHEN SHE HAD FOUND THE LEAK SHE GOTTEN -- THEY HAD PUBLISHED IT SHE HAD PULLED EVERYTHING FROM CASEY TO THE 1973 DECISION AND WENT THROUGH EVERYTHING AND STUDIED UP ON IT AND SOMETHING WE DON'T SEE THAT SHE IS VERY STUDIOUS AND WENT AND STAT WITH THE STAFF AND LIKE WHAT WILL WE DO ABOUT THIS? SHE IMMEDIATELY CONNECTED IT TO BIRTH CONTROL AND GAY MARRIAGE. I THINK A LOT OF US WERE SURPRISED. THE OTHER THING IS I SAID TO HER I WAS WEIRDLY VINDICATED AND SHE WAS LIKE I WAS DEVASTATED FOR THESE WOMEN. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PLACE TO COME FROM AND WOMEN DO SEE HOW MEANINGFUL THIS IS IN A WAY THAT MAYBE MEN DON'T.  ALL RIGHT. SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. A FASCINATING INTERVIEW. > COMING UP NEXT, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR A BEATLES FAN IN YOUR LIFE STICK AROUND. WE ARE JOINING BY AN AUTHOR WITH A BEHIND SCENES ACCOUNT OF THE BIGGEST CONCERT. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT WHEN \"MORNING JOE\" COMES BACK. > THE BEATLES, OF COURSE, BROUGHT IN MORE FOREIGN INDUSTRY. THE QUEEN SAW FIT TO REWARD THE ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION TO THE NATION. THE AWARD ENTITLES THEM TO PUT MBE AFTER THEIR NAMES. WHAT COULD IT MEAN THAN MORE BEATLE ENCORES. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.  OF COURSE PAUL AND RINGO ARE SIRS. BUT IN 1965 BEATLE MANIA AT THE PEAK IN THE UNITED STATES AND ACROSS THE POND. FROM MEETING THE QUEEN TO MEETING THE METS AT SHEA STADIUM. THE FAB FOUR WAS EVERYWHERE THAT YEAR MAKING AN INDELIBLE IMPACT ON THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND THE COUNTRY IN THE PROCESS. LET'S BRING IN LAURA JACOBSON, HER LATEST BOOK \"TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN\" LOOKING AT THE LEGENDARY CONCERT IN QUEENS. THERE'S NO WAY TO DESCRIBE TO ANYBODY -- I WAS ONLY 2. READING BOOKS AND I HAVE BEEN SHOCKED THROUGH THE YEARS TO FIND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ACTUALLY THERE. I COME ACROSS THEM EVERY YEAR BUT TALK ABOUT THAT HISTORIC NIGHT AT SHEA.  IT WAS ABSOLUTELY THE BIGGEST EVENT IN SHOW BUSINESS HISTORY TO THAT DATE. NO ONE PERFORMED BEFORE 56,000 PEOPLE WHY NOT EL VISION, NOT SINATRA. NOBODY AND NOBODY RECEIVED THE PAYCHECK THEY RECEIVED THAT NIGHT. THEY WALKED AWAY WITH $160,000 IN 1965. THAT JUST BROKE EVERY RECORD THERE WAS.  YEAH.  ONLY PLAYED FOR 27 MINUTES.  RIGHT. AND SO FUNNY. DAVID IGNACIUS, YOU WENT TO A BEATLES CONCERT WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG. IT WAS ALL THE TOURS IN 1964, ' 5 AND '66, WE'RE PLAYING ON AMPLIFIERS THE SIZE OF PEANUTS. EVERYBODY IS SCREAMING AND SOUNDS LIKE A JUMBO JET. THEY COULDN'T HEAR THEMSELVES PLAYING.  I WENT TO THE FIRST CONCERT IN AMERICA, FEBRUARY 11, 1964 AT WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE WASHINGTON COLISEUM. MAYBE 3,000-SEAT AUDITORIUM. I WAS PICKING JELLYBEANS OUT OF MY HAIR. A WONDERFUL INTRODUCTION TO THE BEATLES. AT THE TIME OF THE SHEA STADIUM CONCERT WAS THIS A BAND THAT COULD HAVE STAYED TOGETHER. WAS THE BAND THAT PLAYED THERE STILL LOCKED THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE STAYED AND PLAYED FOR ANOTHER DECADE OR MORE?  THAT WAS A BIG SURPRISE TO ME THAT IN 1965 AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR POPULARITY I COULD ALREADY SEE THE SIGNS OF THEIR BREAKUP AND GOING THE SEPARATE WAYS, PARTICULARLY JOHN. HE LOVED MAKING MUSIC WITH HIS MATES BUT HE DIDN'T ENJOY BEING A BEATLE. AND AS A BEATLE HE WAS FORCED TO DO THINGS HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO LIKE HE DIDN'T WANT TO ACCEPT THAT MBE. HE THOUGHT IT WAS RIDICULOUS FOR HIM TO DO SO. AND YET HE WAS FORCED TO DO IT BECAUSE THE OTHER THREE WERE DOING IT. VIETNAM WAS HEATING UP. HE WAS GETTING HIS ACTIVIST PANTS ON. AND THE JACKETS THEY WORE AT SHEA A MILITARY STYLE. HE DIDN'T WANT TO WEAR IT. BUT THE OTHER THREE WERE SO HE HAD TO DO IT. HE GAVE AWAY A PART OF HIMSELF WHY NOBODY COULD HEAR THEM AS RINGO SAID. PEOPLE CAME TO SEE US. THEY DIDN'T COME TO HEAR US AND FRUSTRATING FOR ALL OF THEM. RINGO BECAME THE STAR IN \"A HARD DAY'S NIGHT\" SO HE WAS THE STAR OF \"HELP.\" HOLLYWOOD WAS CALLING HIM AND HE ENJOYED BEING OUT IN FRONT FOR A WHILE SO HE HAD SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON. GEORGE DISCOVERED INDIAN MUSIC AND FLIPPED OUT, BEGAN A SPIRITUAL QUEST AT THAT TIME. PAUL WANTED TO STAY ON THE ROAD WHICH IS CLEAR BECAUSE HE IS STILL ON THE ROAD.  YEAH. STILL ON THE ROAD. STILL INCREDIBLE.  WHEN YOU HEAR THE BEATLES TALKING ABOUT TOURING IN GENERAL THROUGH '65 AND '66 IT JUST GOT SO DANGEROUS. IT WAS A GRIM EXPERIENCE FOR THEM WHY FINALLY DECIDED ENOUGH WAS ENOUGH.  NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO ASK LAURIE IS THAT WERE THEY VERY COMPETITIVE? I WAS CLOSE WITH JAMES BROWN WHO'S LIKE A FATHER TO ME AND THEN I WAS PART OF THE COMMUNITY AFFAIRS FOR MICHAEL JACKSON'S BIG '84 TOUR. THEY WERE ALWAYS WATCHING WHAT OTHER GROUPS WERE DOING. MICHAEL FILL A STADIUM AND SAY DID THE BEATLES FILL THIS STADIUM? HOW COMPETITIVE WERE THEY? WERE THEY MINDFUL HOW POPULAR THEY WERE COMPARED TO OTHER CONTEMPORARY GROUPS AT THE TIME?  OH, CERTAINLY THEY WERE AWARE THAT -- AND IT WAS A SHOCK TO THEM. THEY WITH RESPECT PREPARED FOR WHAT THEY WERE GREETED WITH IN AMERICA AND THE TITLE OF THE BOOK IS A QUOTE FROM JOHN YEARS LATER REFERRING TO SHEA SAYING I SAW THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN ON THAT UNFORGETTABLE NIGHT. THEY WERE ON A RIDE THAT THEY REALLY HAD NO CONTROL OVER UNTIL THEY QUIT TOURING IN '66 AND GOT SERIOUS WITH THE MUSIC AND SPEND TIME IN THE STUDIO AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO. THEY KNEW THEY WERE SETTING THE TREND FOR THE ENTIRE BRITISH INVASION REALLY AND THEIR CAREER CHANGED EVERYTHING IN ROCK N ROLL. NOBODY PLAYED A BASEBALL STADIUM BEFORE. AFTER SHEA BASEBALL STADIUMS WERE ALL YOU SAW. TECHNOLOGY WASN'T READY FOR SHEA BUT FOUR YEARS LATER THEY WERE READY FOR WOODSTOCK. THEY HAD AN IMPACT ON THE MUSIC INDUSTRY AND POP CULTURE. THEY CHANGED EVERYTHING.  THEY -- YEAH. A REVOLUTION IN MUSIC AND POP CULTURE. JUST UNBELIEVABLE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. THE BOOK IS \"TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN.\" LAURIE JACOBSON, THANK YOU SO MUCH. IF YOU WANT TO HEAR WHAT IT SOUNDS LIKE, YOU CAN STILL GET SOME TAPES. LISTEN TO SOME STREAMING OF THE BEATLES LIVE AT SHEA STADIUM OR LIVE AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL RELEASED ON VINYL IN '78 AND JUST PEOPLE SCREAMING. YOU FIGURE OUT QUICKLY THAT PROBABLY NOT HEARING A LOT OF THEIR OWN MUSIC. > THE JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE RELEASED THE FINAL REPORT. THE OVERALL CONCLUSION -- CLEAR. DONALD TRUMP'S LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INSURRECTION. NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT RYAN NOBLES HAS THE LATEST. > OVERNIGHT THE FINAL REPORT. A MORE THAN 800-PAGE NARRATIVE CLAIMING THAT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE VIOLENCE ON THAT DAY.  I THINK FOR MOST AMERICANS IT WAS BEYOND IMAGINATION.  Reporter: THE REPORT PROVIDING EVIDENCE TRUMP AND MEMBERS OF HIS INNER CIRCLE IN AN EFFORT TO CLING TO POWER AND OVERTURN HIS 2020 ELECTION DEFEAT, QUOTE, ENGAGED IN AT LEAST 200 APPARENT ACTS OF PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OUTRAGE, PRESSURE OR CONDEMNATION IN THE TWO MONTHS BETWEEN THE ELECTION AND THE ATTACK ON THE NATION'S CAPITOL.  HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE ENCOURAGED OF DONALD TRUMP, WOULD HAVE NEVER OCCURRED. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE NORMAL TRANSFER OF POWER THAT WE DO EVERY FOUR YEARS WHEN THERE IS A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  Reporter: THE REPORT COMES JUST DAYS AFTER THE NINE-MEMBER COMMITTEE VOTED TO RECOMMEND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PURSUE CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST MR. TRUMP, INCLUDING OBSTRUCTION OF AN OFFICIAL PROCEEDING, CONGRESS' CERTIFICATION OF ELECTORAL VOTES, AND INCITING OR ASSISTING OTHERS IN AN INSURRECTION. EARLIER THIS WEEK THE FORMER PRESIDENT CALLED THE COMMITTEE'S WORK, QUOTE, A PARTISAN ATTEMPT TO SIDELINE HIM IN HIS 2024 PRESIDENTIAL BID. THE COMMITTEE ALSO BEGINNING TO RELEASE HUNDREDS OF PAGES OF TRANSCRIPTS, INCLUDING AN INTERVIEW WITH STAR WITNESS FORMER WHITE HOUSE AIDE CASSIDY HUTCHINSON, WHO CLAIMED A LAWYER WITH TIES TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT SUGGESTED SHE WITHHOLD INFORMATION FROM THE COMMITTEE SAYING, QUOTE, THE LESS THE COMMITTEE THINKS YOU KNOW, THE BETTER. IN A STATEMENT, HE SAID HE REPRESENTED HUTCHINSON, QUOTE, HONORABLY, ETHICALLY AND FULLY CONSISTENT WITH HER SOLE INTERESTS AS SHE COMMUNICATED THEM TO ME. THE JANUARY 6 REPORT ALSO 11 RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENSURE NOTHING LIKE THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL EVER HAPPENS AGAIN. AMONG THEM, URGING CONGRESS TO CONSIDER PASSING LEGISLATION TO BOLSTER SUBPOENA POWER, INCREASE PENALTIES AGAINST THOSE WHO THREAT-ELECTION WORKERS, AND STRENGTHEN THE NATION'S LAWS AGAINST INSURRECTION. THAT WOULD, IN EFFECT, BAR PRESIDENT TRUMP FROM HOLDING OFFICE AGAIN.  NO MAN WHO WOULD BEHAVE THAT WAY AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME CAN EVER SERVE IN ANY POSITION OF AUTHORITY IN OUR NATION AGAIN. HE IS UNFIT FOR ANY OFFICE.  LET'S BRING IN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT RYAN RILEY. STILL WITH US REVEREND AL WHY WHAT IS YOUR BIG TAKEAWAY?  I'M A JUSTICE REPORTER AND FOCUS ON THE DOJ ASPECT OF THIS AND MAIN TAKEAWAY IS TO PULL THE PUNCHES WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT MISTAKES THAT WERE MADE IN THE LEAD-UP TO JANUARY 6. OVERALL THE REPORT TELLS A DAMNING STORY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP AND AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO COMMUNICATE IT TO THE PUBLIC ESPECIALLY WITH THE PUBLIC HAEFRINGS WHICH CAPTURED THE NATION'S ATTENTION BUT ORIGINALLY THEIR ASSIGNMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT LARGELY FINDING OUT HOW EXACTLY DOJ OR THE FBI, DHS HAD MISSED THE RED SIGNS LEADING UP TO JANUARY 6 SUGGESTING VIOLENCE THAT DAY AND SOMETIMES IN TORTURED LANGUAGE TRY TO IN THE APPENDIX RELEGATED TO AVOID REACHING WHAT EXPERTS AGREED THE LARGEST LAW ENFORCEMENT/INTELLIGENCE FAILURE SEEN NATIONWIDE SINCE SEPTEMBER 11th.  RIGHT. WHY DID THEY DO THAT? WHY DIDN'T THEY DRILL DOWN FURTHER? WE HAD COLIN POWELL ON THE SHOW TALKING ABOUT WATCHING WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON JANUARY 6 ASKING THE QUESTION, WHERE THE HELL IS ANYBODY? ALSO, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? THAT'S A QUESTION SO MANY PEOPLE ARE ASKING. YOU SAID THEY GLOSSED OVER THIS PART OF THE STORY. WHY?  I THINK THAT THERE'S A WORRY THAT THIS WOULD DISTRACT FROM THE MAIN COMPONENT THAT DONALD TRUMP RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED AND I THINK YOU CAN WALK AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME. MAKE BOTH OF THOSE POINTS SAYING DONALD TRUMP DID THE THINGS AND INSTIGATED THE MOB AND HAD AN EFFORT TO OVERTURN THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION BUT DOING THAT IN PUBLIC. RIGHT? I THINK THAT JUST PUTTING THE IDEA THAT HEY DONALD TRUMP IS SUMMONS CONSPIRACY THEORISTS ON THE DAY TO TALK ABOUT THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER THIS COULD BE AN ISSUE. I REPORTED THIS WEEK SOMETHING THAT THE JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE KNOWS ABOUT BUT DID NOT INCLUDE IN THE FINAL REPORT WHICH IS THAT ON THE VERY DAY THAT DONALD TRUMP SENT THE INFAMOUS WILL BE WILD TWEET DECEMBER 19th OF 2020 A FBI INFORMANT SAID THAT'S A CALL TO ARMS WEEKS BEFORE THE JANUARY 6 ATTACK. I SPOKE TO A SEPARATE FBI INFORMANT SAYING IN NOVEMBER OF 2020 THAT THE RHETORIC OF DONALD TRUMP TO TAKE PEOPLE TO THE EDGE AND CAUSE THEM TO DO SOMETHING VIOLENT AND NUMEROUS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TOLD ME AT THE TIME AND FORM EVERY AND CURRENT SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP'S RHETORIC WOULD LEAD TO DEATH. THERE IS A TON OF RAW INTELLIGENCE BUBBLING UP AND THE REPORT DOES GET INTO SOME OF THAT BUT THE WAY IT'S SORT OF TRYING TO PIVOT AND SOMETIMES CAN BE REALLY STRANGE TO SEE HOW THEY ARE TRYING TO BRING THE FOCUS ON DONALD TRUMP EVERY TIME SAYING THEY COULD HAVE PREDICTED TO SEND PEOPLE TO THE CAPITOL. I THINK BACK TO, HEY WAIT. THIS IS THE GUY THAT INFORMED MEMBERS OF THE CROWD TO PUNCH PROTESTER AT A RALLY. COPS ONE DAY TO SLAM SUSPECT'S HEADS ON TO THE DOOR OF THE POLICE VEHICLE AS THEY ARE PUT INTO IT. HE'S TALKED DIRECTLY ABOUT VIOLENT RHETORIC AND INSTRUCTED PEOPLE TO COMMIT VIOLENT CRIMES AT THE RALLIES BEFORE. THIS IS ALSO SOMEONE USED BOMBASTIC LANGUAGE ALL THE TIME AND THE IDEA THAT THIS IS UNFORESEEABLE THAT DONALD TRUMP MAY BE IRRESPONSIBLE TELLING PEOPLE THAT THERE'S A MASSIVE CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY TO STEAL THE ELECTION SEEMS LIKE A FAILURE OF IMAGINATION. IT JUST SEEING THE TWO PLUS TWO EQUALS FOUR AND WHEN YOU EVERY ABOUT TO FLOOD THE FBI WITH HALF A BILLION OF FUNDING YOU WOULD THINK YOU WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED FIRST. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CONGRESS TO EVALUATE WHAT WENT WRONG.  I WANT TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT THIS IN THE LAW ENFORCEMENT FAILURE BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM STUNNING TO ME THAT THE FBI HAD NO UNIFIED REPORTING OF THESE THREATS THE REPORT SAYS UNTIL LITERALLY THE DAY BEFORE JANUARY 6. WHAT ARE THE FBI SOURCES TELLING YOU ABOUT THAT?  YEAH. THEY HAD THE RAW INTEL COMING IN AND THERE'S A FOCUS ON JANUARY 20th AND 17th FROM MY REPORTING AND UNDERSTANDING THAT JANUARY 6 WASN'T A HUGE THING UNTIL THAT DONALD TRUMP TWEET AND I THINK THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PIVOT AND AROUND THE HOLIDAYS AND CAN BE A COMPONENT OF THIS. THERE'S NOT AN OVERALL DEEP DIVE LOOK. THAT WAS SORT OF LEFT ON THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR BUT CHAPTER ON THIS PREPARED IN OTHER SECTIONS OF THE JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE BLUE TEAM WHICH WAS FOCUSED ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND HAD THE WORK STYMIED AND ONLY WERE ABLE TO GET OUT SOME OF IT.  ALL RIGHT. NBC NEWS JUSTICE REPORTER RYAN RILEY THANK YOU SO MUCH. > NOW LET'S BRING IN NBC NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER SAHIL KUPUR WHO SPOKE TO MITCH McCONNELL. HE HAD THINGS TO SAY ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. WHAT DID HE SAY?  Reporter: HE LOOKED AND SOUNDED LIKE A MAN WITH SOMETHING TO GET OFF HIS CHEST IN THE CAPITOL LEADERSHIP OFFICE A FEW FEET FROM HERE. NEWSY COMMENTS ISSUING SOME OF THE SHARPEST CRITICISMS I HAVE HEARD HIM EXPRESS ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. IT WAS ABUNDANTLY CLEAR THAT HE HOLDS DONALD TRUMP FOR THE REPUBLICAN'S UNDERPERFORMANCE IN THE 2022 ELECTION. THE DEMOCRATS EXPANDED THE SEATS. WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP? LET'S PUT THIS UP ON THE SCREEN. QUOTE, I THINK THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S POLITICAL CLOUT HAS DIMINISHED. HE WENT ON TO SAY REGARDING 2022, WE LOST THE PORT WE NEEDED WITH INDEPENDENTS AND MODERATE REPUBLICANS RELATED TO THE VIEW THEY HAD OF US AS A PARTY LARGELY MADE BY THE FORMER PRESIDENT THAT WE WERE SORT OF NASTY AND TENDED TO CHAOS. THIS IS MITCH McCONNELL SAYING INDEPENDENTS AND SWING VOTERS CRUCIAL TO THE RESULT IN THE 2022 ELECTION HAVE A NEGATIVE VIEW OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE OF TRUMP. THERE WAS A PURPOSE TO THIS. NOT JUST HIM VENTING BUT A CALL TO TRUMP TO BACK OFF 2024 BY SAYING THEY WANT TO BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN SELECTING QUALITY CANDIDATES AND WILL DO THAT FROM THE START AND SAID THAT HE FELT HE COULDN'T DO MUCH IN 2022 BECAUSE HE CONCEDED DONALD TRUMP'S POLITICAL INFLUENCE SO SIGNIFICANT THERE'S NOT MUCH TO DO IN ALL BUT A COUPLE STATES. REPUBLICANS HELD THE SEATS IN THOSE STATES BUT THE DIMINISHED MAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IN 2024 TRYING TO MAKE A COMEBACK IS NOT ABLE TO HAVE THE SAME INFLUENCE IN THE SENATE PRIMARIES.  ABSOLUTELY FASCINATING INTERVIEW. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GREATLY APPRECIATE IT. HOPE YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL HOLIDAY SEASON. > LET'S BRING IN HISTORIAN AND AUTHOR DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN. I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT A POP MUSIC REFERENCE. MAYBE AN OBSCURE ONE. BARBRA STREISAND SANG \"THE WAY WE WERE\" AND THEN THERE'S ANOTHER VERSION SAYING EVERYBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS AND AS BAD AS THESE ARE THE BAD DAYS THESE ARE THE CHILDREN'S GOOD OLD DAYS.  WOW.  I THINK ABOUT THAT WITH THE HORRIBLE TIME WE ARE MARCHING THROUGH AND THINK OF 2022. SO MUCH NEGATIVE TO THINK ABOUT. I THINK ABOUT ZELENSKYY COMING TO CONGRESS. I THINK ABOUT LIZ CHENEY WHO COULD HAVE JUST STAYED IN LINE AND FOLLOWED MARCHING ORDERS AND SHE WOULD STILL BE IN CONGRESS. SHE LOST. I THINK OF CASSIDY HUTCHINSON. SHE ESCAPED TO NEW JERSEY. TRIED TO GET HELP FROM HER FATHER. TRIED TO GET HELP FROM OTHERS. SHE HAVE ALL ALONE. SHE SAID I WILL GET DESTROYED. I WILL GET NUKED. SHE TESTIFIED ANYWAY. I THINK ABOUT THE FEDERAL COURT SYSTEM. FORGIVE ME BUT THERE'S HEROES IN OUR MIDST. ONE FEDERAL JUDGE AFTER ANOTHER PROVING CHECKS AND BALANCES WORK STILL. AND SAYING NO AND PUSHING BACK TO DONALD TRUMP TIME AND TIME AGAIN. SO THAT'S MY SERMON ABOUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS. SOME BEING TODAY. I'M CURIOUS YOUR THOUGHTS ON LEADERSHIP IN 2022.  I AGREE WITH YOU SO MUCH. IT'S A TEMPERAMENTAL THING TO THINK LIKE YOU DO AND I FIND THE ELEMENTS OF STRENGTH. SOMETIMES THROUGH HISTORY. WE THINK LOOK WHAT THEY LIVED THROUGH. SOMETIME WE FIND IT IN OUR OWN MOMENTS. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY WEEK FOR LEADERSHIP. WE SAW ZELENSKYY COME AND 81 YEARS AGO WINSTON CHURCHILL CAME TO SHORE UP MORALE, SUPPORT OF BRITAIN, A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS SPEECH AND INCREDIBLY POPULAR AND FEEL WE'RE FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY IN WORLD WAR 2 AND UKRAINE NOW AND AT HOME. I THINK THIS REPORT THAT JUST CAME OUT THE POWER IS IN THE NARRATIVE. BARBARA TUCKMAN SAID THAT CHRONOLOGY IS THE SPINE OF HISTORY. LOOK AT EVENTS AS THEY HAPPENED TO SEE CAUSE AND EFFECT AND STORY TELLING IS THE KEY OF THAT REPORT. MAYBE IT LEFT OUT THINGS BUT THE REAL POWER IS PEOPLE SEE FROM CAUSE AND EFFECT THAT DONALD TRUMP RESPONSIBLE NOT SIMPLY FOR WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6 BUT FOR NOT ACCEPTING THE PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER AND CREATING AN ALTERNATE REALITY AND IT MEANT THAT WE LOST TIME, ENERGY AND ALMOST LOST THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. LINCOLN SAID THAT PUBLIC SENTIMENT IS EVERYTHING. IF THIS REPORT CONTINUES TO EDUCATE PUBLIC SENTIMENT STORY TELLING IS IN THE BRAIN. THERE'S A REASON THE PEOPLE SAT AROUND BEFORE PRINTED MATERIAL TO TELL STORIES. IT IS THE WAY WE CONTINUE TO TELL OURSELVES FROM OUR PARENTS TO THE CHILDREN TO THE GRANDCHILDREN AND THIS IS CHAPTER 1 IN THE BOOKS 50 TO 100 YEARS FROM NOW. WHAT WILL CHAPTER 2 BE? WE LISTENED TO THE STORY. A COUNTRY WAS ABLE TO INDICT AND GET A RESPONSE BECAUSE THE PUBLIC SENTIMENT WAS THERE. AND THAT NO PRESIDENT IS ABOVE THE LAW AND WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN. I WISH I COULD SEE CHAPTER 2 RIGHT NOW.  YOU ARE RIGHT. PEOPLE MAY BE PICKING APART THIS REPORT AND MAYBE SOME THINGS THEY THINK THE COMMITTEE SHOULD HAVE DONE BUT THEY TOLD AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY THAT AS YOU SAID IS THE FIRST DRAFT OF HISTORY AND THAT HISTORIANS FOR YEARS TO COME WILL USE AS A PRIMARY REFERENCE. YOU BROUGHT UP CHURCHILL COMING TO THE UNITED STATES. CHRISTMAS EVE 1941 AND JOINED FDR AT THE WHITE HOUSE CHRISTMAS TREE LIGHTING AND SPOKE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MOMENT.  I STAND THIS ANNIVERSARY AND FESTIVAL FAR FROM MY COUNTRY, FAR FROM MY FAMILY. AND YET, I CANNOT TRUTHFULLY SAY THAT I FEEL FAR FROM HOME. LET THE CHILDREN HAVE THEIR NIGHT OF FUN AND LAUGHTER. LET THE GIFTS OF FATHER CHRISTMAS DELIGHT THEIR PLAY. LET US GROWN-UPS SHARE TO THE FULL IN THEIR UNSTENTED PLEASURES BEFORE WE TURN AGAIN TO THE STERN TASK AND FORMIDABLE YEAR THAT LIE BEFORE US. AND SO, IN GOD'S MERCY A HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO YOU ALL.  IF HISTORY DOESN'T REPEAT ITSELF IT'S RHYMING VERY OBVIOUSLY THIS WEEK. ISN'T IT REMARKABLE? CHURCHILL IN 1941 AND HERE ZELENSKYY IN 2022.  WOW. JUST HEARING THE GIFT OF RHETORIC CHURCHILL HAD. THE COURAGE THAT ZELENSKYY TOOK TO TAKE HIMSELF AWAY FROM UKRAINE. CHURCHILL ON A WARSHIP WITH U-BOATS IN THE WATER. AMERICA HELD THE NEED OF RESOURCES THEY BOTH HAD. THAT VISIT WITH CHURCHILL IS EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE HE DISRUPTED THE WHITE HOUSE. HE WAS THERE FOR THREE WEEKS AND STAY UP WITH ROOSEVELT UNTIL 2:00 IN THE MORNING. HE WOULD NAP WHILE ROOSEVELT HAD TO RUN THE COUNTRY. THE GREAT MOMENT THAT HAPPENS AT THE PART OF THE VISIT THEY LINE A DECLARATION THE 26 NATIONS AGAINST THE AXIS POWERS WILL BE TOGETHER UNTIL THE END. NO SEPARATE PEACE. THEY WERE CALLING THEMSELVES THE ASSOCIATED NATIONS. ROOSEVELT SAID THE UNITED NATIONS. SO EXCITED IS WHEELED INTO THE BEDROOM OF CHURCHILL. HE HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ON. ROOSEVELT SAID I'LL COME BACK. CHURCHILL STANDS UP STRAIGHT DRIPPING FROM THE TUB SAYS PLEASE STAY. THE PRIME MINISTER OF GREAT BRITAIN HAS NOTHING TO HIDE FROM THE UNITED STATES PRESIDENT. CAN YOU IMAGINE? I MENTIONED THIS WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WAS ON THE WHITE HOUSE AND SHE INVITED ME TO A SLEEPOVER AND WE SLEPT IN CHURCHILL'S ROOM AND I WAS SURE HE WAS IN THE ROOM AND I COULDN'T WAIT TO GO IN THE TUB. IT WAS A GREAT MOMENT.  OH, IT SOUNDS AMAZING. PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BE US WITH. WE HOPE YOU HAVE AN ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL HOLIDAY SEASON. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU, JOE. SAME TO YOU.  ALL RIGHT. > STILL AHEAD ON \"MORNING JOE,\" NEW TRANSCRIPTS RELEASED BY THE JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT POTENTIAL CHARGES OF WITNESS TAMPERING.

        "trs": "> CRIMINAL REFERRALS DO NOT CARRY LEGAL WEIGHT BUT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT SYMBOLIC REBUKE OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND IT REMAINS UNCLEAR JUST HOW CLOSELY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL'S OFFICE IN CHARGE OF THE DOJ'S OWN INVESTIGATION WILL FOLLOW THE PATH MAPPED OUT BY THE JANUARY 6 COMMIT TEE OR WHETHER TRUMP OR OTHERS WILL FACE ANY CRIMINAL CHARGES AT ALL. \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" POINTS OUT THAT NOT MUCH IS PUBLICLY KNOWN ABOUT ANY SPECIFIC CHARGES THE SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH MIGHT BE CONSIDERING IN A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION. AND THE DEPARTMENT IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ADOPT THE COMMITTEE'S CONCLUSIONS. JOINING US IS FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY AND SENIOR FBI OFFICIAL CHUCK ROSENBERG. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE OPTIONS ARE FOR THE DOJ AND WHAT'S YOUR GUT ON HOW THIS MATERIAL WILL OR WILL NOT BE USED?  UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD A LARGE, COMPLEX, ONGOING INVESTIGATION. YOU MADE THE POINT EARLIER AND YOU ARE RIGHT THAT THE LAW MOVES SLOWLY AND BETWEEN SLOWLY AND RECKLESSLY I TAKE SLOWLY EVERY TIME SO THE WORK IS ONGOING. I DON'T KNOW THAT THE -- LOOK. ON ONE HAND THE REFERRAL IS OF GREAT SYMBOLIC AND HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE. NO COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS REFERRED A PRESIDENT FOR PROSECUTION. IT HAS GREAT MEANING. FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHERE I USED TO WORK IT IS ALMOST LITERALLY MEANINGLESS. NO SUBSTANTIVE VALUE. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS GREAT INVESTIGATORS, GREAT AGENTS. BEEN DOING THIS WORK AND KNOW THE STATUTES TO BE APPLICABLE. IF THE COMMITTEE REALLY WANTS TO HELP THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, I PRESUME THEY DO, THERE ARE A COUPLE WAYS TO DO THAT. TELLING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHAT CHARGES IT OUGHT TO BRING ISN'T THAT HELPFUL. GIVING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE TESTIMONY AND EVIDENCE COULD BE HELPFUL. THAT'S ONE THING THEY WANTED ALL ALONG, THE TRANSCRIPTS OF THE TESTIMONY OF THE VARIOUS WITNESSES WITH WHOM THE COMMITTEE SPOKE. THERE'S A LARGE ONGOING INVEST. I BELIEVE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WILL MAKE PRINCIPLE DECISIONS. IT DOESN'T NEED THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION. THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THE COMMITTEE DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB. THEY DID. BUT PROVING SOMETHING IN A HEARING ROOM IS DIFFERENT THAN THE FEDERAL COURT. THE FIRST THING IS EASIER. THE SECOND THING IS MUCH HARDER.  CHUCK, I TAKE WHAT YOU SAID 100% BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND HOW THEY THINK. THEY ARE NOT SEQUESTERED LIKE A JURY IN A HOTEL ROOM SOME PLACE. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DID HEAR AND SEE WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY. AND THEY DID TAKE IN AT LEAST THE COMMITTEE'S VIEW ON WHAT THE PRESIDENT, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD BE CHARGED WITH. WOULD YOU AGREE WITH MY ASSESSMENT THAT PERHAPS THE LEAST LIKELY OF THE CHARGES TO ACTUALLY BE BROUGHT BY JUSTICE WOULD BE THE INSURRECTION CHARGE? OR, DO YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW?  YEAH. YOU KNOW, EUGENE, IT IS A GREAT QUESTION. YOU AND I INDEPENDENTLY I THINK HAVE COME UP WITH A LIST OF WHICH CHARGES PERTAIN AND WHICH MIGHT NOT. HERE'S THE PROBLEM WITH TRYING TO MAKE AN ASSESSMENT NOW. I HATE TO BE A WET BLANKET BUT SO BE IT. THE COMMITTEE SPOKE TO OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE. IF EACH PERSON SPOKE WITH THE COMMITTEE FOR SAY SIX HOURS OR EIGHT HOURS THAT'S 8,000 HOURS OF TESTIMONY AND HEARING. WE SAW 20 HOURS WORTH OF STUFF. THAT IS NOT A CRITICISM OF THE COMMITTEE. I THINK THEY MADE AN OUTSTANDING PRESENTATION. IT WAS TERRIFIC. BUT IT IS NOT ALL OF THE STUFF THAT PROSECUTORS NEED TO MAKE A DETERMINATION. TO YOUR QUESTION DO I THINK INSURRECTION IS THE LEAST OR MOST LIKELY CHARGE? I DON'T KNOW. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT LOTS OF FOLKS COMMITTED LOTS OF CRIMES. TO PROVE IT IN CRIMINAL YOU NEED TO CONVINCE A JURY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THAT'S HARD TO DO GIVEN THAT WE HAVE A SMALL SLICE OF EVIDENCE IN PUBLIC.  WELL PUT.  CHUCK, AGAIN, THANKS FOR THAT SORT OF CAVEAT ABOUT WE TEND TO GET CARRIED AWAY BY WHAT CONSTITUTES PROOF IN THE MEDIA-SPHERE. WHAT'S COME OUT FROM THE COMMITTEE AND REPORTING ELSEWHERE SEEMS TO THE AVERAGE PERSON WITHOUT A LAW DEGREE AND NOT WORKING AT JUSTICE DEPARTMENT SEEMS TO BE CONCLUSIVE AND YET I IMAGINE IF YOU'RE JACK SMITH AND EVALUATING WHETHER A GRAND JURY CAN ACCEPT BEYOND ALL REASONABLE DOUBT THAT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT AT THE END OF WEEKS AND WEEKS OF HEARINGS TO THE AVERAGE PERSON. IT DOES SEEM REALLY CONCLUSIVE. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT WILL BE TO JACK SMITH'S DECISION WHETHER AND WHAT TO INDICT TRUMP AND COHORTS WITH?  GREAT QUESTION. TO WIN A CASE IN FEDERAL COURT YOU NEED TO CONVINCE THE JURY UNANIMOUSLY BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THE HEARINGS WERE TERRIFIC. JACK SMITH AND THE TEAM WILL HAVE TO HAVE MAKE PRINCIPLED DECISIONS UNDERSTANDING THAT EVERYTHING THEY INTRODUCE IN COURT WILL BE CHALLENGED. EVERY STORY THEY TELL WILL HAVE SOMEONE ELSE TELLING AN OPPOSITE STORY. IT IS NOT JUST INDICTING THE CASE IN GRAND JURY BUT COURT WHERE YOU NEED PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THAT'S A DIFFICULT STANDARD WHY NOT IMPOSSIBLE. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME BUT DIFFICULT AND IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO KEEP THE DIFFERENCES IN MIND. > COMING UP, ACTOR JESSE TYLER FERGUSON REVISITING THE PERFORMANCE OF \"TAKE ME OUT.\" THAT CONVERSATION AHEAD ON \"MORNING JOE.\" > -- HAS A COLUMN IN \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" ENTITLED THE END OF THE TRUMP ERA WILL BE UNSATISFYING.  WELL, IF IT IS THE END OF THE TRUMP ERA --  I THIS THAT'S SATISFYING.  I'M GOOD.  SINCE THE 2022 MIDTERM ELECTIONS --  I DON'T NEED LASERS. RIGHT?  BECOME A 50-50 PROPOSITION. WHILE RON DESANTIS SURGES IN MULTIPLE NATIONAL POLLS, THE FORMER PRESIDENT BUSIED HIMSELF SCHILLING $99 DIGITAL TRADING CARDS TO HIS MOST DEVOTED FANS. THERE WILL BE NO PERP WALK WHERE TRUMP EXITS THE WHITE HOUSE BUT COULD STILL FACE INDICTMENT. NO SCRIPTED DENUNCIATION DRIVING HIM IN SHAME FROM THE PUBLIC SQUARE. THIS DESIRE FOR VINDICATION IS COMPLETELY UNDERSTANDABLE. HOW ELSE CAN YOU ENSURE THAT MISTAKES WON'T BE REPEATED OR AN AWFUL DEMAGOGUE WON'T SLIP INTO SHEEP'S CLOTHING AND RETURN? THE ANSWER, HOWEVER, AND THIS IS TOUGH MEDICINE, THE WAY TO AVERT THAT REPETITION IS TO MAKE CERTAIN YOU HAVE A STRATEGY TO WIN THE NEXT ELECTION AND THE ONES AFTER THAT ON THE PUBLIC'S TERMS RATHER THAN YOUR OWN.  LET'S BRING IN THE HOST OF \"WAY TOO EARLY\" JONATHAN LEMIRE AND JEN PSAKI. JEN, I WAS -- I READ THIS OP-ED AND I WANTED TO DISAGREE WITH IT BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I DON'T NEED LASERS. THE END OF THE TRUMP ERA MEANS DEMOCRACY SURVIVED THE CHALLENGE. IT BRINGS UP A GREAT POINT THERE AND A REASON WHY WE DO IT TODAY. WE HAD A -- THE MORNING AFTER THE ELECTION I TEXTED MY CHILDREN WHO WERE ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SPECTRUM AND TEXTED ALL FOUR AND SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT? DEMOCRACY HAD A GREAT NIGHT LAST NIGHT. EVERY ELECTION DENIER LOST. AMERICA WINS. BUT THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE AS WE SAY -- EXCUSE ME FOR BEING A GUY HERE -- BLOCKING AND TACKLING. RIGHT?  WOMEN LIKE FOOTBALL, TOO.  I KNOW YOU DO. SO YOU UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T WIN BY PRACTICING THE WONDERFUL SPEECHES. IT IS THE BLOCKING AND THE TACKLING. I WILL SAY I HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF DEMOCRATS. DOESN'T ANYBODY KNOW HOW TO PLAY THIS GAME? AT TIMES THEY SEEM HAPLESS. EVERY TIGHT THE MEARSES BLOCKING AND TACKLING. IN '22 BLOCKING AND TACKLING. GOT THE PEOPLE TO THE POLLS WHETHER A COALITION OF PEOPLE OF COLOR OR WHEN THE NUMBERS WENT DOWN A LITTLE BIT IT'S WHITE PEOPLE IN THE SUBURBS THAT USED TO VOTE REPUBLICAN. THEY GOT THE PEOPLE OUT. ROSS IS RIGHT. IT IS THE BLOCKING AND TACKLING THAT WILL SAVE DEMOCRACY. NOT THE FLOOR AND SPEECHES.  SO TRUE. I THOUGHT THAT OP-ED IS EXCELLENT, TOO. WINNING ELECTIONS AND DEFEATING ELECTION DENIERS AND TRUMP IS NOT ALWAYS SEXY WORK. RIGHT? IT IS RUNNING ON AN AGENDA AS MANY DEMOCRATS DID OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW YEARS AND TURNING PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE WHICH THEY DID IN DROVES AS WE KNOW AND MORE WORK TO DO. WHAT HAPPENS IN JANUARY? WHAT HAPPENS IN FEBRUARY? HOW ARE OWE KEEPING THE COALITIONS TOGETHER? ARE YOU STAYING TRUE TO THE AGENDA YOU'RE RUNNING ON THAT WON IN 2022? BUT THAT'S THE ONLY WAY. ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES AND ELECTIONS IN 2024 COULD BE THE END OF TRUMP BUT REQUIRES DOING ALL THOSE THINGS. > COMING UP, DICTIONARY.COM NAMED THE WORD OF THE YEAR FOR 2022.  DUDE!  NO. WE'LL TELL YOU THE WORD AND WHY IT WAS PICKED.  DUDE WASN'T PICKED?  NO.  DUDE!  \"MORNING JOE\" IS COMING RIGHT BACK.  I GUESS IT'S JUST AROUND OUR HOUSE. > NOW TO A MAJOR VICTORY FOR WOMEN IN THE SPORTS WORLD. THE SIX-YEAR BATTLE FOR EQUAL PAY FOR MEMBERS OF THE U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM HAS FINALLY COME TO AN END WITH A LANDMARK SETTLEMENT.  BIG REACTION TODAY TO THE SUPREME COURT'S BOMBSHELL DECISION TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE, LEAVING THE ABORTION RIGHTS TO STATE LAWMAKELAWMAKER. MOMENTS AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT, AMERICANS TOOK TO THE STREETS.  SERENA WILLIAMS HAS ALL BUT CONFIRMED HER RETIREMENT FROM TENNIS AFTER DEFEAT IN THE THIRD ROUND OF THE U.S. OPEN.  GOOD DAY, EVERYONE. SOME SAD BREAKING NEWS. QUEEN ELIZABETH II HAS DIED AT THE AGE OF 96.  NOW TO THE DEADLY PROTESTS IN IRAN, SPREADING OUT TO SOME IRANIANS AROUND THE GLOBE. AUTHORITIES CRACKING DOWN IN IRAN. ALL OF THIS SPARKED BY THE MURDER -- DEATH OF A YOUNG WOMAN.  BRITTNEY GRINER HAS BEEN RELEASED FROM RUSSIAN PRISON.  AS WE TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THIS YEAR'S BIG STORIES, WOMEN'S RIGHTS HAVE RETURNED AS A PRIMARY ISSUE DRIVING VOTERS. THE WORD WOMAN HAS BEEN SELECTED AS THE WORD OF THE YEAR BY DICTIONARY.COM. HERE TO EXPLAIN WHY, FORBES WOMEN EDITOR MAGGIE McGRATH, ALSO THE DRIVING FORCE OF THE KNOW YOUR VALUE AND FORBES ANNUAL 50 OVER 50 LIST. I GUESS FIRST OF ALL WHY WAS THIS WORD CHOSEN AS THE WORD OF THE YEAR? AND WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT HOW IT'S SHAPING OUR NATIONAL DIALOGUE?  WELL, MIKA, AS WE SAW IN THAT FABULOUS REEL THAT JUST PLAYED, AND THIS IS WHAT THE FOLKS AT DICTIONARY.COM SAID, THE WORD WOMAN WAS INSEPARABLE FROM THE STORY OF 2022. AND WE SEE THAT IN THE NUMBERS. DICTIONARY.COM OVER THE COURSE OF 2022 SAW THE DOUBLING IN THE NUMBER OF SEARCHES FOR THIS WORD. THE BIGGEST JUMP CAME IN MARCH. THERE WAS A 1,400% SURGE IN PEOPLE LOOKING FOR THE WORD WOMAN, AND THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THE SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS FOR JUDGE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON FOR THE SUPREME COURT. SHE WAS ASKED, CAN YOU DEFINE THE WORD WOMAN? AND SHE BASICALLY SAID NO, I CAN'T, AND THEN IN A FOLLOWUP QUESTION THE NEXT DAY SHE SAID I KNOW THAT I AM A WOMAN. I THINK THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF US WOULD SAY. THAT'S ALSO WHAT DICTIONARY.COM SAYS. WE'RE NOT THE FINAL AUTHORITY ON THIS. THE WORD BELONGS TO WOMEN AND HOW THEY DEFINE IT THEMSELVES.  WHAT OTHER CRUCIAL MOMENTS INVOLVING WOMEN THAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST YEAR THAT RESULTED IN PEOPLE SEARCHING IT AND CHOOSING IT AS THE WORD OF THE YEAR?  OF COURSE ROE V. WADE, WE SAW A SEARCH THERE AND SEARCHES FOR AUTONOMY, FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE. WE SAW SURGES AROUND THE U.S. SOCCER TEAM EQUAL PAY SETTLEMENT, THE $24 MILLION SETTLEMENT THAT WAS ANNOUNCED THIS YEAR. WE SAW SIMILAR SURGES AROUND THE DEATH OF MAHSA AMINI AND THE REMARKABLE PROTESTS WE'VE SEEN IN IRAN FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS. AND OF COURSE THE DEATH OF QUEEN ELIZABETH II WHICH I LEARNED FROM DICTIONARY.COM AGAIN, THAT THE WORD HAS AN ETYMOLOGY THAT GOES BACK TO AN OLD ENG WISH WORD THAT MEANS WOMAN. PEOPLE ARE SEARCHING FOR THIS WORD BECAUSE THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN, THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCE OF FEMALE LEADERS, PEOPLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE WHO MAY RECEIVE MORE ABUSE THAN THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS, FEMALE FOUNDERS WHO RECEIVED LOWER LEVELS OF FUNDER THAN THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS. IT'S MY HOPE IN SEARCHING FOR THIS WORD AND SEEKING UNDERSTANDING MAYBE WE CAN FIND SOLUTIONS TO THESE PROBLEMS.  WHILE WE'RE AT IT, WHAT OTHER WORDS MADE THE SHORT LIST FOR WORD OF THE YEAR?  THIS IS FUNNY. ONE OF THE WORLDS WAS THE UKRAINIAN FLAG EMOJI, WHICH WE CAN PROBABLY HAVE A SEPARATE DEBATE IF THAT'S A WORD, BUT WE ALSO HAVE FOUND INFLATION, QUIET QUITTING, THE PHENOMENON WHERE YOU KIND OF ONLY DO WHAT YOUR JOB DESCRIPTION REQUIRES, DEMOCRACY, AND OF COURSE MY FAVORITE GAME, WORDLE.  LOOKING AHEAD, WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES AT THE 30/50 SUMMIT ON AND AROUND INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY, BUT WHAT OTHER STORIES OR ISSUES DO YOU THINK WE'LL BE SEEING A LOT MORE OF IN THE NEXT YEAR?  SO, I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM MY SOURCES, AND I'M SURE YOU'VE BEEN HEARING THE SAME, THE ATTACK ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IS NOT GOING TO END WHEN THE CALENDAR TURNS TO 2023. WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE ROLLBACKS, MORE STATE RESTRICTIONS, WE MAY SEE AN ATTACK ON CONTRACEPTION. I THINK REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS WRIT LARGE IS SOMETHING TO WATCH NEXT YEAR. ALSO, LOOKING AT THE QUIET QUITTING TREND OR PHENOMENON, THERE'S ANOTHER WORD THAT'S BUBBLING UP CALLED CAREER CUSHIONING, WHICH IS KIND OF A CUTE TERM JUST FOR LOOKING FOR A JOB WHILE YOU HAVE A JOB. BUT AS WE SEE MORE LAYOFFS IN THE CORPORATE SECTOR, MORE PEOPLE NEEDING TO LOOK FOR JOBS, I THINK WE'LL SEE MORE OF THAT WORD. ANOTHER CUSHION, EMERGENCY CUSHION. I WAS SPEAKING TO FORBES CONTRIBUTOR ALONA TALKING ABOUT IF YOU ARE A WOMAN, A PERSON OF COLOR, YOU NEED TO SAVE MORE IN YOUR EMERGENCY CUSHION.  EDITOR OF \"FORBES WOMEN,\" MAGGIE McGRATH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR MORE ON THE STORY, HEAD OVER TO FORBES.COM. WE'LL ALSO HEAR MORE FROM MAGGIE IN THE WEEKS TO COME AS WE GET READY FOR THE FORBES 30/50 SUMMIT KNOW YOUR VALUE IN ABU DHABI. THE EVENT WILL HAVE A STAR-STUDDED LINEUP OF SPEAKERS. HILLARY CLINTON, GLORIA STEINEM, MALALA, AND MORE ANNOUNCEMENTS COMING SOON. GET YOUR TICKETS TO THE SUMMIT SOON.

        "trs": "I REPEAT, ONCE YOU TOOK IT HAS BEEN SCANNED, PLEASE CONTINUE TO WALK FORWARD INTO THE WARNING AREA. IF YOU LOOK BACK, THE POWERS THAT BE ARE UNFORTUNATELY FORCED TO MORE FEWER MELANIN EXTERIOR INTO THAT OF A PRIVILEGED WHITE MALE.  THAT IS A SCENE FROM THE NEW BROADWAY SHOW, AIN'T NO MOW. A PRODUCTION MANY CRITICS AGREE SHOULD BE A BOX OFFICE SMASH. BUT, DESPITE RAVER VIEWS, AND WIDESPREAD INTEREST, JUST ONE WEEK AFTER OPENING THE SHOW FEATURING AND ALL BLACK CAST, ALREADY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD END ITS RUN AFTER STRUGGLING AT THE BOX OFFICE. BUT, SOME LAST-MINUTE ASSIST FROM FOLKS LIKE TYLER PERRY, WILL SMITH, AND JADA PICKETT SMITH HAVE HELPED TO KEEP IT ALIVE. AS BLACK BOX OFFICE TITANS HAVE BOUGHT OUT WHOLE SHOWINGS OF WHAT HOLLYWOOD REPORTERS DESCRIBED AS A PROVOCATIVE COMMITTEE, WHICH ASKS THE QUESTION, WHAT IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTED TO SOLVE RACISM BY OFFERING BLACK AMERICANS ONE-WAY PLANE TICKETS TO AFRICA. JOINING ME NOW IS AWARD-WINNING PERFORMER AND PLAYWRIGHT JORDAN -Y COOPER. HE IS THE CREATOR AND STAR OF AIN'T NO MOW. AND, THE YOUNGEST BLACK AMERICAN PLAYWRIGHT IN BROADWAY HISTORY. JORDAN, WE APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US TONIGHT. TO START OFF, I WANT TO ASK FOR AUDIENCE, WHO MAY NOT UNDERSTAND HOW BROADWAY WORKS, WHO MAY HAVE NEVER BEEN TO A BROADWAY SHOW, HOW WELL MOST EVEN A CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED SHOW LIKE EIGHT NO MOW, WITH A BLACK CAST AND A BLACK PERSPECTIVE, HAVE TO DO IN ORDER TO BE COMPETITIVE WITH THE PREDOMINATELY WHITE PRODUCTIONS, BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS IS AT LEAST IN PART WHAT YOU'RE SHOW'S CONTENDING WITH. COMPETING FOR EYES AND EARS WHILE BLACK. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THAT?  ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THAT THIS IS A SHOW THAT REALLY, IN ORDER TO MAKE SOMETHING A BOX OFFICE HIT IT HAS TO MEET ITS WEEKLY COSTS. AND, WHAT WE WERE STRUGGLING TO MEET WITH OUR WEEKLY COSTS IN ORDER TO PUT UP THE SHOW. AND WE WERE ONLY UP FOR ABOUT A WEEK AFTER OPENING BEFORE WE GOT OUR CLOSING NOTICE TO REALLY SEE IF WE WERE ABLE TO BUILD AN AUDIENCE, LITERALLY THAT WEEK WE HAD JUST GOTTEN IS GLOWING REVIEWS, AND THEN A COUPLE DAYS LATER WE ARE GETTING A CLOSING NOTICE. SO WE HAVE A CHANCE TO BUILD AUDIENCE. WHICH WITH THE SHELL LIKE, THIS TAKES TIME. A LOT OF SHOWS ON BROADWAY RIGHT NOW, THEY START CELEBRITIES. SAMUEL JACKSON IS IN THE PIANO LESSON RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T HAVE A CELEBRITY ONSTAGE. WE ARE NOT BASED OFF OF A MOVIE, OR FAMILIAR STORY THAT PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT, OR A SONG, OR AN ARTIST. SO IT TAKES TIME TO REALLY LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT, HEY THERE'S SOMETHING HAPPENING HERE THAT ESPECIALLY NOW TO CHECK IT OUT.  AS I UNDERSTAND IT, YOU WERE PREPARED TO SHUT THE SHOWDOWN TOMORROW. BUT YOU'VE GOT SOME ASSIST FROM SOME BLACK HOLLYWOOD A LISTER'S TO KEEP A SHOW OPEN. I KNOW THAT ACTORS WILL SMITH AND JADA PICKETT SMITH HAVE BROUGHT OUT SHOWINGS. PRODUCER SHONDA RHIMES, FORMER NBA STAR DWYANE WADE AND HIS WIFE. ACTOR GABRIEL UNION, ACTORS WILL BE GOLDBERG AND BILLY PORTER WERE IN THE HOUSE LAST NIGHT, ALONG WITH SOME OTHER PLAYERS OF THE NEW YORK JETS, NFL TEAM. I UNDERSTAND. AND THIS WEEK, WE THOUGHT FILMMAKER TYLER PERRY HAVE STEPPED UP TO BUY SOME SHOWINGS. AND AS A RESULT, THE SHOW WILL GO ON AT LEAST THROUGH DECEMBER 23RD. AS A BLACK CREATOR IN PERFORMER, WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO YOU TO SEE THESE HEAVY HITTERS GO TO BAT IN A DIFFERENT WAY, AND IN DIFFERENT WAYS FOR YOUR CREATION?  LITERALLY, IT IS UNPRECEDENTED. I AM SO HONORED AND HUMBLED THAT THEY BELIEVE IN THE WORK THAT MUCH, AND THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO JUMP INTO THE BATTLEFIELD LIKE THAT AND PUT THEIR MONEY WHERE THEIR MOUTH IS. LITERALLY. YOU KNOW, IT IS HARD FOR BROADWAY PERIOD, LIFE THEATER RIGHT NOW AFTER THE PANDEMIC. AND ESPECIALLY HARD FOR SHOWS OF COLOR WHEN WE DON'T HAVE THOSE THINGS THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. AND I THINK THAT WE HAVE A MARKETING SYSTEM IN THE BROADWAY COMMUNITY THAT ARE THE SAME TOOLS THAT THEY USE FOR EVERY SHOW. AND, THIS IS A PLAY THAT I DIDN'T NECESSARILY RIGHT FOR THE SAME AUDIENCE THAT WOULD GO TO A NORMAL BROADWAY SHOW. SO, THE PROBLEM WAS THAT WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TIME TO MARK IT TO THE AUDIENCE ARE BELIEVE THAT THIS PLAY IS FOR. SO IT INVOLVES PUTTING UP BILLBOARDS IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY NORMALLY SEE BROADWAY SHOWS. BECAUSE, IT'S LIKE, WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN TAUGHT THAT BROADWAY IS AND FOR US. WE'VE GENERALLY BEEN TAUGHT THAT THOSE SHOWS DON'T BELONG TO US, UNLESS GISELE ISN'T IT. AND LAST SAMUEL JACKSON ISN'T IT. BUT, THE TRUTH, IS A LOT OF BLACK ARTISAN DOING WORK FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE NEARBY COMMUNITY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS BECAUSE THOSE MARKETING TOOLS JUST DON'T GET TO THEM. WHEN THAT LIE THAT IT DOESN'T BELONG TO US IS ACTUALLY JUST THAT, ALLY, BECAUSE EVEN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE SHOVEL ALONG, WHICH WAS A HUGE MUSICAL SENSATION IN 1921. ONE OF THE FIRST BLACK BROADWAY SHOWS. IT WAS LITERALLY THE BEGINNING OF 50 YEARS OF THE GREATEST MUSICALS. THE GARAGE WINS GOT THEIR SCORE FROM A SHUFFLE ALONG. THEY SAT, THERE THEY WATCH, THEY TOOK NOTES. ALL OF THESE BEAUTIFUL COMPOSERS TOOK FROM THESE BRILLIANT BLACK CREATORS TO CREATE THEIR GENIUS CREATIONS. AND, IN THAT VERY EXISTENCE IT SHOWS THAT IN THE ROOTS OF BROADWAY IT IS OURS TO YOU. AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO WITH A NO MORE, IT SHOW THAT THEATER DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WHAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN LOOKING LIKE. ROBBIE DOESN'T HAVE TO LOOK LIKE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN LOOKING LIKE. AND, THANKFULLY THERE IS SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING TOGETHER, RALLYING TOGETHER, AND LEAVING THAT MISSION THAT ARE SAYING HEY WE WANT PEOPLE TO SEE THIS AND SEE THIS REVOLUTION THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO HAVE ONSTAGE.  AND, YOU KNOW, TALKING ABOUT A LISTER'S, THAT YOU HAVE INVOLVED AN ELASTIC HIMSELF, LEE DANIELS. BUT JORDAN, I APPRECIATE. AS FUNNY AS THE SHOW IS, THAT IT EXPLICITLY TACKLES RACE AND POLITICS WITHOUT FEAR. I WANT TO WATCH ANOTHER SCENE FROM AIN'T NO MORE. THIS ONE ABOUT POLITICS AND PROTEST. TAKE A LOOK.  WITH THESE WOMEN ARE DOING HERE, IS BEING SEEN BY SOME AS AN EXTREME FORM OF PROTEST.  THIS IS A PROTEST, THIS IS FEAR.  WELL, WHAT ABOUT THOSE THAT SAY THAT FEAR IS AFRICA SOMETHING AFRICAN AMERICANS OF ALWAYS HAD OVERCOME? WHAT MAKES THIS DAY MORE OF A DANGER THAN THE ONES BEFORE?  SIMPLY THE FACT THAT A PERSON BUBBLY EDUCATED BLACK WOMEN HAS A MICROPHONE IN HER HEAD IT IS BEING BROADCAST LAB NATIONAL TELE-TELEVISION. OR THE REALITY THAT EDUCATED BLACK MAN WHO'S USED TO LIVE IN THE WHITE HOUSE. OR THE FACT THAT A BLACK WOMAN COULD BE A SITTING VICE PRESIDENT. TOOTH, AS WE HAVE ALREADY WON. THAT IS WHAT MAKES TODAY MORE DANGEROUS THAN YESTERDAY.  DO YOU THINK CHALLENGING SUBJECT MATTER HAS PLAYED A ROLE IN THE STRUGGLES THEY SHOW HAS FACED SINCE THE OPENING?  OH, ABSOLUTELY. I THINK THAT WE HAVE SOME TOUGH CONVERSATIONS IN THE SHOW. BUT THANKFULLY, THEY ARE DONE IN A WAY WHERE EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SWALLOW IT GOING TO PUT THE THING IN THE MOUTH. AND SAY, OKAY, WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE? WHAT IS THIS? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY? AND, I AM NOT AFRAID TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ABORTION, AND ABOUT MASS INCARCERATION, AND ABOUT QUEER INJUSTICE EVEN WITHIN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THESE ARE ALL CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPEN WITHIN, BECAUSE WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO SHOW, IT IS A PLAY ABOUT EVERYBODY WANTING TO GO BACK TO AFRICA. AND, YOU WATCH ALL OF THESE ARE PEOPLE DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE GETTING ON THE FINAL PLANE OUT. BUT, WITHIN THAT YOU SEE THEIR LIVES AND YOU SEE WHY THEY WANT TO LEAVE AND WHAT SITUATIONS THEY HAVE BEEN PUT IN IN ORDER TO WANT TO FIND A NEW PROMISED LAND. AND THEN, AS THE PLAY GOES ON AND WE REALLY DISCOVER HOW DIFFICULT THAT REALLY IS IN THE MIDST OF OUR LAUGHING.  YOU KNOW, JORDAN, MANY OF THE PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT HOW AFRICA FEATURES PROMINENTLY IN YOUR PLAY. IN THIS WEEK, PRESIDENT BIDEN HELD A THREE-DAY SUMMIT WITH NEARLY 50 AFRICAN LEADERS. DURING THE MEETING, THE WHITE HOUSE PLEDGED TO SPEND $55 MILLION IN THE CONTINENT OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS, AND ANNOUNCED PLANNING WAS UNDERWAY FOR THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL VISIT TO SUBDUE HERE INTO AFRICA IN 2000, SINCE 2015 THERE HAS BEEN ONE. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AFRICAN AMERICANS AND PRESENT A AFRICA, AND DO YOU THINK THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW KINDS OF LINKAGES IN THE FUTURE. WE ARE OUT OF TIME, BUT I WANTED YOU TO.  I THINK THEY'RE ABSOLUTELY IS. I THINK WE HAVE, A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THIS ROMANTICIZED IDEA OF WHAT AFRICA IS, WINDOW NECESSARILY ALWAYS DO THE WORK TO SEE WHAT THE CONTINENT NEEDS, AND WHAT CERTAIN COUNTRIES NEED. AND, IT IS AN INTERESTING DICHOTOMY BECAUSE IN AIN'T NO MORE, WE EXPLORE. THAT EVERYBODY IS LIKE WE'RE GOING BACK TO AFRICA. BUT THE REALITY IS, BECAUSE WE HAD A DASH IN FRONT OF OUR IDENTITY, AFRICAN AMERICAN, IT IS A LITTLE BIT SLIPPERY. IS THAT REALLY ARE HOME? THAT IS WHERE ANCESTORS CAME FROM, BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE ALL WENT THERE? THEN, ARE WE THE COLONIZERS? ARE WE THE ONES TAKING UP SPACE. IT IS REALLY INTERESTING TO SEE THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AFRICANS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS, AND HOW THE PAIN AND THE TERROR OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH HAS DROVE THIS WEDGE BETWEEN US. THAT WE HAVE TO DO THE WORK TO TRY TO TEAR APART. AND THANKFULLY, WE ARE TAKING STEPS TOWARDS THAT IT LOOKS LIKE.  YOU SHOW YOUR BRILLIANCE. YOU COME FROM GOOD STOCK. HOW DO I KNOW, BECAUSE YOU TELL ME THAT YOUR DAD IS AN AVID WATCHER POLITICSNATION.  BRADLEY COOPER. , JOINING COOPER, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US.

THOSE PEOPLE ARRESTED ON FRAUD, MANY HAVE BEEN TOLD BY ELECTION OFFICIALS THEY COULD LEGALLY VOTE. NOW THOSE CASES ARE FALLING APART AND CHARGES ARE GETTING DROPPED. THERE IS ONE THING -- WHEN REALLY SIGNIFICANT PART OF ACTUALLY GOVERNING -- LIKE, THE ACTUAL POWER OF THE STATE THAT HAS TO DO WITH FREEDOM AND RIGHTS AND AUTONOMY AND NOT BEING TOLD BY THE GOVERNMENT WHAT TO DO. YOU MIGHT EVEN SAY IT'S ABOUT FREEDOM, WHICH DESANTIS DOES NOT WANT TO TALK ABOUT. AND THAT'S ABORTION. AFTER THE SUPREME COURT'S DOBBS RULING STRIKING DOWN ROE V. WADE IN JUNE, FLORIDA BANNED ABORTIONS AFTER 15 WEEKS WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS. ANTIABORTION ADVOCATES WANT MORE. BASICALLY, THEY WANT TO TOTAL ABORTION BAN IN SIX WEEKS. RON DESANTIS IS A SAVVY ENOUGH POLITICAL OPERATOR TO UNDERSTAND THAT A TOTAL BAN -- THE SIX-WEEK BAN WOULD NOT BE POPULAR IN FLORIDA. SO, WHILE HE WAS RUNNING FOR REELECTION THIS YEAR HE BASICALLY RAN AWAY FROM THE QUESTION. I MEAN THAT LITERALLY.  WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE AS AN ULTIMATE END TO ABORTION? IS THAT YOU ARE --  IT'S WEIRD. HE'S SUCH A SWAGGERING TOUGH GUY WHEN HE'S GOT HIS SET PIECES AND HIS BIG PRESS CONFERENCES, WHERE HE ANNOUNCES WHAT NEW ENEMY OF THE DAY HE'S TAKING ON. NOT THERE, THOUGH. YOU NOTICE THAT? NOT THERE. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED AFTER HIS BIG WIN IN THE ELECTION? RON DESANTIS WAS ACTS AGAIN ABOUT THE SIX-WEEK BAN AND NOW HE SAYS HE IS, QUOTE, WILLING TO SIGN GREAT LIFE LEGISLATION. JOIN ME NOW IS FLORIDA STATE REPRESENTATIVE ANNA ESKAMANI. SHE PREVIOUSLY SERVED AS A PUBLIC AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA. SHE NOW LEADS THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE ON ABORTION. REPRESENTATIVE, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU. FIRST, CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT THE STATE OF FLORIDA ABORTION LAW IS NOW POST-DOBBS?  THANKS SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. RIGHT NOW, IN FLORIDA, WE HAVE A 15-WEEK ABORTION BAN SIGNED INTO LAW BY GOVERNOR DESANTIS WITH NO EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE, INCEST OR HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IT IS IMPACTING OUR PATIENTS. WE ARE SEEING DOCTORS ALLOW WOMEN TO BECOME MORE SICK BEFORE THEY CAN ACCESS CARE. AND WE ARE SEEING MINORS BE FORCED TO GO TO OTHER STATES WHEN THEY EXPERIENCE INCEST IN ORDER TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE FOR TERMINATION OF THAT PREGNANCY. SO, EVEN THOUGH IT'S A 15-WEEK BAN, IT STILL HAS BEEN DEVASTATING AND WE ARE PREPARING, AS YOU JUST REPORTED ON, GOVERNOR DESANTIS PUSHING IN A MARCHING BAND.  SO, GIVEN THAT YOU SERVED IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND YOUR BACKGROUND IS IN REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, MY UNDERSTANDING, AS I WAS FOLLOWING THIS ISSUE IN THE RUN UP TO THE ELECTION WAS THAT IT WAS ALWAYS CLEAR THAT FLORIDA ROLLINS WERE NOT GOING TO STOP AT 15 WEEKS. FOR FOLKS THAT ARGUE THAT THIS IS MURDER, THAT IS TOTALLY INSUFFICIENT. THEY DON'T WANT TO ALLOW PAST SIX WEEKS OR SO, NOT AT ALL. SO, IT WAS ALWAYS VERY CLEAR THAT REPUBLICANS IN THE STATE HAS WANTED THAT. RON DESANTIS SEEMED TO SUCCESSFULLY EVADE EVER DEFINITIVELY ANSWERING THE QUESTION OF WHETHER HE WOULD SUPPORT THAT INEVITABLY, THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE ELECTION, THE CAMPAIGN.  ABSOLUTELY. GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS IS PRACTICING THE IDEOLOGY OF CONVENIENCE, WHERE HE PREACHES FREEDOM IN THE CASE OF VACCINES AND MASKS AND THEN WANTS TO TAKE AWAY BODILY AUTONOMY AND FREEDOM FOR MORE THAN HALF THE STATE. AND HE WOULD RUN SCARED WHENEVER HE WAS ASKED ABOUT ABORTION. HE WOULD PIVOT TO A DIFFERENT SUBJECT MATTER. EVEN WHEN HE SIGNED THE ABORTION BAN THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY IN TO LAW HE TALKED ABOUT OTHER ISSUES WHILE SIGNING THAT BAN. SO, HE'S CLEARLY RUNNING SCARED FROM THIS ISSUE. AND HE SHOULD. BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF FLORIDIANS AGREED THAT ABORTION SHOULD REMAIN SAFE AND LEGAL. AND AS WE SAW AROUND THE COUNTRY, ABORTION ACCESS IS A WINNING ISSUE. WE KNOW THAT IN THE UNITED STATES. WE KNOW THAT HERE IN FLORIDA.  SO, THERE HAS CLEARLY BEEN PRESSURE FROM THE ANTIABORTION CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICANS WHO WANT TO BAN ABORTION COMPLETELY OR PAST THE SIX-WEEK BAN IN THIS CASE. TO GET HIM ON BOARD. WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN TERMS OF THE MOVEMENT ON THAT? BECAUSE IT NOW SEEMS LIKE THE FIX WAS KIND OF IN FROM THE BEGINNING. PEOPLE THAT I KNOW WHO KNOW THIS SPACE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE THE CASE THAT IF HE WON, WHICH SEEMS LIKELY, AND GOT MAJORITIES IN THE STATE HOUSE, ELECTION IT WAS GOING TO COME AND GO IN AND, BOOM, PRESSED, ARE NOW ON TO THE SIX-WEEK BAN. IS THAT BASICALLY WHAT IS HAPPENING? HE HERE IS THE DEAL, CHRIS. GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS WANTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. AND TRUMP CAN TAKE CREDIT FOR THE ENTIRE DOBBS DECISION, AS HE HAS DONE FOR MONTHS NOW. AND SO, IF YOU ARE GOING TO RUN AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP, YOU HAVE TO BE ANTIABORTION. YOU HAVE TO BE VERY EXTREME ON YOUR ANTIABORTION POSITIONS. BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AS THE TICKET FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, TRYING TO APPEAL TO EVERY AMERICAN -- IT'S NOT POPULAR TO BAN ABORTION. SO, DESANTIS FINDS HIMSELF IN A REALLY INTERESTING PLACE, WHERE HE'S FEELING PRESSURE FROM THE RIGHT TO BAN ABORTION BUT HE KNOWS IT'S NOT POPULAR IN THE STATE, WHICH IS WHY DURING THE CAMPAIGN CYCLE HE AVOIDED IT. BUT CANDIDLY, WE KNOW HIS POSITIONS. HE SUSPENDED STATE ATTORNEY ANDREW WARREN IN HILLSBURGH COUNTY BECAUSE ANDREW WARREN SAID HE WOULD NOW THAN CORP INCARCERATE WOMEN OR DOCTORS IN THE CASE OF AN ABORTION. AND HE HAND EDITED THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REMOVE HIM USING ANTI ABORTION RHETORIC. SO, WE KNOW HE IS EXTREME. HE JUST BEING VERY EFFECTIVE IN HIDING FROM IT  YES, BUT EVENTUALLY, HE'S GONNA HAVE TO DO ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. THAT'S WHY THEY MADE. HE RAN AWAY FROM THE QUESTIONS. HE AVOIDED IT. -- I ALREADY SAW SOME CONSERVATIVE PUBLICATION SAYING, HE'S ON BOARD. THERE IS CLEARLY JOCKEYING GOING ON. DOES THAT GIVE YOU, IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE, SOME DAYLIGHT, SOME OPPORTUNITY TO ORGANIZE AN EFFECTIVE OPPOSITION TO A SIX-WEEK BAN IN YOUR STATE?  I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT QUESTION. WE ACTUALLY ALREADY POSTED TODAY A VIRTUAL EVENT TO KICK OFF 2023, FOCUSED ON PROTECTING ABORTION IN FLORIDA IN JANUARY. WE ARE PLANNING NATIONAL PROTESTS ON JANUARY 22ND, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. WADE. BUT YES, WE ARE IN THE SUPER MINORITY IN FLORIDA, SO I CAN'T CONTROL THE VOTES IN THE CHAMBER. BUT I CAN BUILD THE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR ABORTION ACCESS TO HELP US NOT ONLY TRY TO STOP THIS ABORTION BAN BUT HOPEFULLY BE SUCCESSFUL IN 2024 IN FLIPPING FLORIDA AND EVEN CODIFYING ABORTION RIGHTS IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION.  I HAVE NOT SEEN POLLING ON THIS RECENTLY. I CAN'T IMAGINE A SIX-WEEK BAN IN FLORIDA HAS MAJORITY SUPPORT. I JUST CAN'T SEE IT.  ABSOLUTELY NOT. WE HAVE A STATE THAT CARES ABOUT FREEDOM. WE CARE ABOUT SELF DETERMINATION. AND WE BELIEVE FIRMLY THAT DECISIONS ABOUT ONE'S PREGNANCY MUST REMAIN BETWEEN A WOMAN, HER FAMILY, HER DOCTOR AND HER FAITH AND NOT POLITICIANS LIKE GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS.  YOU ACTUALLY ARE FAIRLY UNIQUE IN THAT YOU COME FROM PLANNED PARENTHOOD. YOU HAVE A BACKGROUND IN REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE AND YOU ARE COMING FROM THAT INTO ELECTED OFFICE. AND YOU DON'T -- AS FAR AS I CAN TELL -- YOU DON'T REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT'S AN 80 20 DEMOCRATIC DISTRICT. IT'S ACTUALLY A SWING DISTRICT. AND YOU WRITE ON YOUR BACKGROUND AND REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE PRE-DOBBS, BEFORE DOBBS, IN 2018, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE AMONG VOTERS THAT MIGHT NOT SHARE ALL OF YOUR POLITICS?  I LEARNED THAT ABORTION ACCESS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE OF ALL POLITICAL PERSUASIONS, WHETHER YOU ARE A DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, IN PA, WHETHER YOU VOTED OR NOT -- ABORTION REMAINS A VERY PERSONAL DECISION AND SITUATION THAT FOLKS HAVE AND THE IDEOLOGY WANT GOVERNMENT TO STAY AWAY FROM. AND THE FACT THAT I FLIPPED MY SEAT IN 2018 AND THEY KEPT IT IN 2020 AND 2022 BY -- ABORTION OUT LOUD, INSPIRED OTHER DEMOCRATS TO DO THE SAME.  ALL RIGHT. WE WILL SEE WHERE THIS ALL GOES. MY SUSPICION IS THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO HOLD OFF ON THIS FOR LONG, THERE'S GOING TO BE MOUNTING PRESSURE FROM BOTH SIDES. AND I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT. IN TERMS OF THAT PRIMARY POSITIONING, HE'S GOING TO SEE THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR HIS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. I SUSPECT WE WILL MOVE FORWARD. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT WILL BE A MARK THAT WILL BE VERY, VERY HARD TO UNDO WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC SHOULD COME TO END|20221217015955|2022-12-17_0100_US_MSNBC_All_In_With_Chris_Hayes ",

REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE LET BRAD RAFFENSPERGER'S ASKING STATE LAWMAKERS TO END GENERAL ELECTION RUNOFFS WHICH GEORGIA HOLDS WHEN -- RAFFENSPERGER SAYS, QUOTE, NOBODY WANTS TO BE DEALING WITH POLITICS IN THE MIDDLE THEIR FAMILY HOLIDAY. THE IRONIC THING IS THAT GEORGIA STARTED GENERAL RUNOFFS TO MAKE SURE THAT BLACK CANDIDATES TO AN OFFENSE. THE LAW IS NOT HELPING. REPUBLICANS. WHEN THEY WANT TO CHANGE IT. THE REPUBLICANS AROUND THE COUNTRY ALSO MOVING TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR VOTERS TO PASS BALLOT MEASURES AFTER FIVE STATES HAD ABORTION ON THE BALL IN THE MIDTERMS, CALIFORNIA, MONTANA, KENTUCKY, VERMONT. A CLEAN SWEEP IN FAVOR OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. SEEING THE WRITING ON THE WALL, REPUBLICANS IN OHIO RACED TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR CITIES AND LEAD INITIATIVES TO PASS. THEY  WOULD MAKE IT THROUGH A CITIZEN INITIATED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON ANY BALLOTS WOULD HAVE TO PAT BY 60% OF THE VOTE RATHER THAN THE CURRENT SIMPLE MAJORITY.  IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT YOUR IDEA IS BROADLY POPULAR ENOUGH TO MUSTER 60% VOTE OF THE PEOPLE, THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER BRINGING IT TO THE BALLOT.  LET'S BE CLEAR. REPUBLICANS DIDN'T ADMIT IT PUBLICLY AT FIRST, THAT THIS WAS ABOUT ABORTION, THOUGH OBVIOUSLY. WAS OHIO HAD INSTITUTED A SIX-WEEK ABORTION BAN WITHIN HOURS OF THE SUPREME COURT SURGEON TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE. BALLOT MEASURES WERE CREATED TO AMEND THE OHIO STATE CONSTITUTION IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE ABORTION ACCESS. THE CLEVELAND PLAIN DEALER REPORTER OBTAINED A LETTER FROM THE PUBLICAN SPONSOR THAT SAID QUOTE, AFTER DECADES OF REPUBLICANS WORK TO MAKE OHIO A PRO-LIFE STATE, THE LEFT INTENDS TO WRITE ABORTION ON DEMAND INTO OHIO'S CONSTITUTION. SO IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS. THE PLAN FAILED. AFTER PROTESTERS SHOWED UP ALL MASS AT THE STATE HOUSE.

THAT WOULD REQUIRE VOTERS TO PRESENT PHOTO I.D., LIMIT BALLOT DROP BOXES, REDUCE DAYS FOR EARLY VOTING.

        "trs": " CONGRESSWOMAN JACKIE SPEARS HAS BEEN AN OUTSPOKEN ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS SINCE HER ELECTION IN 2008. IN 2000, 11 SHE GOT PERSONAL ON THE HOUSE FLOOR DURING A DEBATE OVER FUNDING FOR PLANNED PARENTHOOD. SAYING SHE PREVIOUSLY HAD HAD AN ABORTION.  THAT PROCEDURE THAT YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT WAS A PROCEDURE THAT I ENDURED. I LOST A BABY. BUT FOR YOU TO STAND ON THIS FLOOR AND TO SUGGEST, AS YOU HAVE, THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS A PROCEDURE THAT IS EITHER WELCOMED OR DONE CAVALIERLY OR DONE WITHOUT ANY THOUGHT HIS PREPOSTEROUS.  SPEIER FIRST BECAME KNOWN NATIONALLY AS A CONGRESSIONAL AIDE TO CONGRESSMAN LEO RYAN. IN 1970, EIGHT WHEN THEY WENT TO GUY, AND THEY WERE INVESTIGATING CULT LEADER JIM JONES AS REPORTS OF ABUSE AMONG HUNDREDS OF PARISHIONERS FROM HIS SAN FRANCISCO CONGREGATION HAD FOLLOWED HIM. WHEN THE TEAM TRIED TO GO, TAKING PEOPLE WITH, AND MEMBERS OF JONES'S TEAM AMBUSH THEM ON A JUNGLE TARMAC. KILLING THE CONGRESSMAN AND FOR OTHERS, INCLUDING NBC CORRESPONDENT DON HARRIS AND NBC CAMERA MAN BOB BROWN. SPEIER WAS SHOT FIVE TIMES AND LEFT FOR DEAD. JONES AND HIS HENCHMEN THEN GOT MORE THAN 900 OF THE CULT MEMBERS TO DRINK POISONED KOOL-AID AND DIED BY SUICIDE IN THE JUNGLE. SPEIER EVENTUALLY RECOVERED AFTER MANY SURGERIES, AND A 2008 SHE WON CONGRESSMAN RYAN'S OLD SEAT, INSPIRED IN PART BY THE AFTERMATH OF HER HEROISM DURING THE JONESTOWN MASSACRE. JOINING ME NOW IS DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN JACKIE SPEIER, WHO ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR SHE WAS NOT GOING TO SEEK REELECTION. CONGRESSWOMAN, WE'VE TALKED OVER THE YEARS. AS YOU KNOW, I COVERED JONESTOWN MORE THAN 40 YEARS AGO. WHAT LED YOU TO THE DECISION AT THE HEIGHT OF YOUR POWER AND SENIORITY TO DECIDE NOT TO RUN?  YOU KNOW, IT WAS A HARD DECISION, ANDREA. BUT IT'S TIME TO PASS THE TORCH TO A NEW GENERATION. I HAVE A HUSBAND AT HOME WHO IS TIRED OF A WEEKEND WIFE AFTER 20 YEARS. AND IT'S TIME TO GO HOME, BUT I'M NOT LOSING MY VOICE. I INTEND TO BE VERY ENGAGED LOCALLY AND STILL ON A FEDERAL LEVEL, WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES AROUND ABORTION, GUN VIOLENCE AND OUR MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN.  SO, YOU WERE ONE OF THE FIRST MEMBERS OF CONGRESS TO SHARE YOUR STORY ABOUT ABORTION. AND, RESPONSE OBVIOUSLY, TO THE DEBATE AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE BEING SAID BY THE MEN IN THAT DEBATE. HOW FAR ALONG HAVE WE COME? NOW, AFTER DOBBS AND AFTER ALL OF THESE STATE LAWS?  WE'VE LOST 50 YEARS OF RIGHTS FOR WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT FOR THE FEW STATES THAT ALLOW IT, WE'VE GOT 26 STATES NOW THAT ARE BASICALLY PROHIBITING ABORTIONS. I MEAN, BASICALLY MANDATING BY GOVERNMENT THAT YOU CARRY A PREGNANCY TO TERM. AND WHEN HE REALIZED THAT 57% OF THE WOMEN WHO HAVE ABORTIONS ARE ALREADY MOTHERS, IT'S BECAUSE THEY WANT TO TAKE CARE OF THE CHILDREN THAT THEY HAVE. THEY ARE OFTENTIMES SINGLE PARENTS.  IN YOUR CASE, THERE WAS A PROBLEM, FATAL PROBLEM WITH THE FETUS.  RIGHT, THE FETUS HAD FLIPPED TO THE CERVIX AND THEN TO THE VAGINA. IT WAS NOT SURVIVABLE. BUT THE WAY I WAS TREATED AND THE WAY THEY WERE REFERRING TO SECOND TRIMESTER ABORTIONS ON THE FLOOR, BY READING FROM A BOOK THAT WAS FULL OF NONSENSE, WAS SO OFFENSIVE TO ME THAT I SPOKE UP.  YOU KNOW, I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE, ALSO, DEALING WITH THE POST TRAUMATIC STRESS AND THE PHYSICAL PROBLEMS FROM THE INITIAL TRAGEDY THAT YOU EXPERIENCED IN THE JUNGLES OF DIANA. YOU HAD YEARS AND YEARS OF RECUPERATION.  I DID. I WAS A PHYSICAL THERAPY FOR OVER FIVE YEARS. THE BODY IS REMARKABLE, IT'S A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT. AND THAT I WAS ABLE TO REGENERATE JUST NATURALLY MY RADIO NERVE. I STILL HAVE TWO BULLETS THAT I CARRY WITH ME, A VERY SCARRED BODY, BUT I'M ALIVE. IT WAS SUCH A POWERFUL MESSAGE OF HOW SHORT SOME OF OUR LIVES ARE AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO LIVE EVERY DAY AS FULLY AS POSSIBLE.  WHAT ABOUT THE EMOTIONAL EFFECTS OF THAT KIND OF VIOLENCE YOU EXPERIENCED? ALSO THE VIOLENCE IN JOHNSTOWN.  THE EMOTIONAL EFFECT IS REAL. I THINK FOR ALL THE SURVIVORS, THERE IS GUILT FOR HAVING SURVIVED, TO SURVIVORS GUILT. EVERY TIME THERE'S A 21 GUN SALUTE, MY BODY KIND OF REACTS TO THAT. IT TAKES TIME TO RECOVER. AND THERE IS A CERTAIN ANXIETY THAT YOU CARRY WITH YOU. BUT I TRIED TO TURN THAT INTO A POSITIVE AND BECOME FEARLESS, IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING A LOT OF THE LEGISLATIVE ISSUES THAT I HAVE DEALT WITH.  WHAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE YOU MOST PROUD OF?  WELL, I WOULD START WITH THE ISSUE OF TAKING SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT OUT OF THE CHAIN OF COMMAND IN THE MILITARY. DEALING WITH THE METOO CONGRESS ACT, MAKING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE AND FOR ANY SEXUAL HARASSMENT THEY ENGAGE IN. HAVING TO PAY FOR IT OUT OF THEIR OWN POCKETS. PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH, WE'VE INCREASED FROM 1% OF THE NIH BUDGET TO 8%. AND THE ROS\u00c9 THE REVELER CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL WAS ONE THAT WAS KIND OF FUN TO GET THROUGH. A LOT OF THE ISSUES AROUND WOMEN, REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. ONE REGRET IS NOT GETTING THE DEADLINE IN THE YEAR A STRUCK, SO THAT WE COULD IN FACT HEAVEN SAY THAT YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF SEX.  I WAS THINKING THE OTHER DAY, I WANT TO HOUSTON FOR THE WOMEN'S CONFERENCE AS A LOCAL REPORTER BASED YEAR, AND WE WENT DOWN TO 1977 THE WOMEN'S LEADERS. THE ABSOLUTE, GLORIA STEINEM, SURELY CHOSE HOME. AND THREE FIRST LADIES, THREE FIRST LADIES, INCLUDING ROSALYNN CARTER AND BETTY FORD. THE FACT THAT THEY RAN OUT OF TIME WITH ONE STATE, FRIDGE IN, YET STILL LEFT TO RATIFY. AND THE DEADLINE EXPIRED AND THAT LEGISLATION NEVER GOT PASSED.  THAT'S RIGHT. AND THEN WE DO HAVE 38 STATES THAT ACTUALLY RATIFIED THAT EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT. AND IT'S JUST STRIKING, THAT DEADLINE, WHICH IS IN THE PREAMBLE OF THE AMENDMENT. 24 WORDS. AND WHERE THE ONLY COUNTRY WITH A WRITTEN CONSTITUTION THAT DOES NOT HAVE AN EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT IN IT.  AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT CONGRESS NOW, IT'S IT IN BETTER SHAPE THAN WHEN YOU CAME? THERE ARE MORE WOMEN.  THERE ARE MORE WOMEN.  MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR.  THAT IS TRUE. THERE'S MORE THAN DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHEN I FIRST GOT TO CONGRESS. SO, THAT'S A VERY POSITIVE CHANGE. BUT IT'S GOTTEN VERY TOXIC, AND IT'S BECOME A POLITICAL PUSH AND PULL. IT IS IN FACT A BLOOD SPORT NOW, WHICH HAS TO END. AND WE'VE GOT TO TONE DOWN THE RHETORIC, BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN TOO MUCH VIOLENCE AS A RESULT OF IT.  SOCIAL MEDIA OF COURSE BEING A BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO THAT. IT CAMPAIGN MONEY.  THAT'S RIGHT. IF YOU ARE IN RIGHT OUTRAGEOUS ENOUGH ON SOCIAL MEDIA, YOU CAN RAISE MORE MONEY.  IT'S A VICIOUS CYCLE. JACQUI SPEIER, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, I KNOW IT'S NOT ENDING. AND WE WISH YOU WELL INTO ADVENTURES. IT'S BEEN LOVELY HAVOC ACROSS THE TABLE, HERE WE HOPE WE SEE YOU AGAIN.  THANK YOU.  AND, SANDY HOOK REMEMBERED.

        "trs": "> MORE THAN 1,000 MIGRANTS CROSSED THE U.S. SOUTHERN BORDER INTO EL PASO, TEXAS, ON SUNDAY. ONE OF THE LARGEST RECENT SINGLE CROSSINGS. THE GROUP IS MAINLY FROM NICK RAG AWAY WHERE THE REGIME IS CRACKING DOWN ON CIVIL SOCIETY. SOME OF THE MIGRANTS WERE KIDNAPPED AND EXTORTED FOR MONEY WHILE IN MEXICO.  THEY SAY THEY ARE HUNGRY AND THAT AFTER GOING THROUGH SO MANY THINGS INCLUDING BEING KIDNAPPED IN MEXICO, THEY HOPE TO NOW BE IN A BETTER PLACE BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THERE'S NEW REPORTING COMING OUT ABOUT THE CRISIS AT THE BORDER. THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AT THE BORDER. BUT I WANT TO TAKE YOU TO THE WHITE HOUSE, WHERE IN JUST SECONDS PRESIDENT BIDEN IS EXPECTED TO SPEAK ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY, ABOUT INFLATION, THE NEW NUMBERS THAT CAME OUT THIS MORNING. THEY WERE FAR LESS THE RATE OF OF INFLATION INCREASE THAN MANY HAD FEARED. CERTAINLY GOOD NEWS. SO PRESIDENT BIDEN IS EXPECTED TO SPEAK ON THAT INFLATION REPORT IN JUST MOMENTS. WE'RE GIVEN THE TWO-MINUTE WARNING ABOUT TWO MINUTES AGO, SO THAT'S THE CAMERA SHOT I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR AT THE WHITE HOUSE. WE EXPECT TO SEE THE PRESIDENT ANY MOMENT THERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE LATEST INFLATION REPORTS. I WANT TO BRING IN HOMELAND SECURITY CORRESPONDENT JULIA AINSLEY. AS WE AWAIT THE PRESIDENT'S ARRIVAL, I MAY HAVE TO INTERRUPT YOU, BUT I WANT TO GO BACK TO THAT ISSUE WE JUST STARTED TALKING ABOUT, WHICH IS THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS AT THE BORDER. JULIA, IS THIS THE NEW NORM? THOUSAND PEOPLE PLUS CROSS JUST ONE NIGHT?  YES, JOSE. IN FACT, I JUST SPOKE TO A DHS OFFICIAL WHO TOLD ME THIS IS NOT A SURGE. THIS IS THE NEW REALITY. AND THE SOONER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS AND REPUBLICANS CAN ALL COME TOGETHER, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS CAN COME TOGETHER AND ADDRESS THIS SURGE AND GET THE RESOURCES THEY NEED AT THE BORDER, THE BETTER. RIGHT NOW, WE UNDERSTAND THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS CONSIDERING NEW ASYLUM POLICIES THAT COULD REALLY RESTRICT THE NUMBER OF IMMIGRANTS AT THE BORDER. NEXT WEEK THE TITLE 42 COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS WILL BE LIFTING. SO THE NUMBERS AT THE BORDER ARE EXPECTED TO GET EVEN HIGHER. AS MANY AS 10,000 A DAY. AND WHAT THEY ARE PROMISING OR THINKING ABOUT AT THIS POINT IS TO ALLOW SOME NEW LEGAL PATHWAYS FOR IMMIGRANTS FROM NICARAGUA, CUBA, WHO CAN APPLY IN THEIR HOME COUNT,000,000,000,000 BUT SIMILAR TO THE POLICY, THEY THINK THAT WILL BE A NARROWER PATHWAY. A LOT OF ADVOCATES SAY YOU'RE SLAMMING A DOOR AND CRACKING A WINDOW. THIS IS PART OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH AS THEY CONSIDER WHAT TO DO WITH THESE RISING NUMBERS AND THE FACT THAT THE NUMBERS ARE LIKELY TO GET MUCH HIGHER NEXT WEEK WHEN ABSENT OF COURT ORDER, THE COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS WILL LIFT AND MANY MORE MIGRANTS WILL BE ABLE TO NOT ONLY CROSS THE BORDER, BUT STAY HERE AND SEEK ASYLUM.  SO IT SEEMS AS THOUGH FOR NOW WHAT THE BORDER POLICY HAS BEEN AT THE UNITED STATES IS ESSENTIALLY MPP. IT WAS TAKEN BACK, BUT IT'S KIND OF 2.0. YOU HAVE TITLE 42, WHICH IS SET TO EXPIRE. BUT WHAT IS THE CONTINGENCY PLAN, AND WHAT IS POLICY AS FAR AS THE BORDER? AND FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK FOR ASYLUM, THEY ARE COMING FROM PLACES LIKE NICARAGUA, WHEN IS HAVING HUGE POLITICAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF THE REGIME THERE. CUBA, VENEZUELA, WHAT IS THE POLICY?  WELL, THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT A NUMBER OF THINGS. . I'M TOLD NOTHING HAS BEEN SET IN STONE. NO ONE HAS SIGNED OFF ON THIS YET. THEY HAD OVER A HALF DOZEN MEETINGS JUST OVER THE WEEKEND. BOTH DHS AND THE WHITE HOUSE WHERE THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT WHAT ESSENTIALLY IS A PAGE OUT OF STEVEN MILLER'S BOOK. IT'S A TRANSIT BAN THAT WOULD REQUIRE ASYLUM SEEKERS TO FIRST TRY TO CLAIM ASYLUM IN THE COUNTRY. IT COULD BE A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES THAT IMMIGRATION ADVOCATES HERE IN THE U.S. SAY DON'T HAVE AB ASYLUM SYSTEM THAT'S ROBUST ENOUGH TO GIVE PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE FLEEING THE VERY CONFLICTS THAT YOU LAID OUT. AND SO INSTEAD BY THE TIME THEY GET HERE, THE ONLY WAY THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO CLAIM ASYLUM IS IF THEY WERE FIRST DENIED ASYLUM BY ONE OF THOSE COUNTRIES OR COULD PROVE THAT THEY WOULD QUALIFY FOR PROTECTIONS UNDER CONVENTION AGAINST TORT CUR. BE ABLE TO SHOW AN OFFICER THEY ARE LIKELY TO FACE TORTURE, NOT JUST PERSECUTION, NOT JUST BEING OSTRACIZED AS PART OF A SOCIAL GROUP, BUT TORTURE. IT'S A HIGHER BAR. AS WE ARE NOW PREPARING TO REPORT AT NBC, WE ARE NOW REPORTING, THESE ASYLUM OFFICERS ARE BEING TRAINED, THEY HAVE PLANNING FOR THIS TRAINING RIGHT NOW TO BE ABLE TO DO INTERVIEWS AT THE BORDER THAT WOULD RAISE THAT BAR. THAT'S HOW FARTHER THIS THIS PROCESS. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF OPTIONS TO TRY TO KEEP THESE NUMBERS AT THE BORDER FROM GETTING EVEN HIGHER AND HAVING MORE CHAOS. BUT THERE'S LIKELY TO BE A LOT OF BACKLASH AND ONLY FROM THE IMMIGRATION COMMUNITY AND POSSIBLY IN COURT. THIS COULD BE ENJOINED AND STOPPED. IT'S A SIMILAR POLICY TO ONE THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION STARTED AND THIS ADMINISTRATION, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ENDED UPON TAKING OFFICE. NOW THEY ARE GOING BACK TO SOME OF THE VERY SAME POLICY, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE HOPING UP SOME MORE NARROW PATHWAYS FOR PEOPLE TO APPLY LEGALLY IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES LOOP LIKELY TO FACE A LOT OF BACKLASH.  JULIA, I WANT TO CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION, BUT I'M JUST GOING TO GO RIGHT NOW TO THE WHITE HOUSE. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THAT SHOT. THERE'S THE PRESIDENT.  I WOULD ARGUE FOR THE YEAR AHEAD WE LEARNED LAST MONTH THE INFLATION RATE CAME DOWN MORE THAN EXPERTS EXPECTED. IN A WORLD WHERE INFLATION IS RISING IN DOUBLE DIGITS, INFLATION IS COMING DOWN IN AMERICA. IN FACT, THIS NEW REPORT IS THE FIFTH MONTH IN A ROW WHERE ANNUAL INFLATION HAS FALLEN IN THE UNITED STATES. INFLATION OUTSIDE OF FOOD AND ENERGY, A KEY MEASURE OF THAT, ALSO FELL. PRICES ARE STILL TOO HIGH. BUT THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER. THEY ARE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. MOST AMERICANS CAN SEE THE PROGRESS DRIVING DOWN THE STREET, FINDING RELIEF AT THE PUMP AS GAS PRICES WOULD FALL. GAS PRICES ARE NOW LOWER THAN A YEAR AGO AND HALF THE GAS STATIONS SELLING GAS AT $3.09 OR LESS. THE MOST COMMON PRICE FOR GAS STATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS $2.99. THE DECLINE IN GAS PRICE IS GIVING CONSUMERS A BREAK. THEY NEED HELP KEEPING OUR ECONOMY GOING. A TWO-CAR FAMILY ARE SAVING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS A MONTH. IT'S A BIG DEAL. TODAY'S REPORT CONTAINS ANOTHER PIECE OF GOOD NEWS. FOOD INFLATION HAS SLOWED PROVIDING RELIEF FOR FAMILIES AT THE GROCERY STORE. THIS IS WELCOME NUDES FOR FAMILIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AS THEY GET READY FOR THE HOLIDAY CELEBRATIONS. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE PUT TODAY'S NEWS IN BROADER CONTEXT. WHEN I TOOK OFFICE, WE INHERITED A NATION WITH A PANDEMIC RAGING AND AN ECONOMY THAT WAS REELING. WE ACTED QUICKLY AND BOLDLY TO VACCINATE THE COUNTRY AND PUT IN PLACE A NEW ECONOMIC STRATEGY. A STRATEGY TO BUILD ON AN ECONOMY BASED ON FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND THE MIDDLE OUT. NOW 21 MONTHS LATER, WE CAN SEE HOW OUR ECONOMIC PLAN IS WORKING. WE ADDED EVERY SINGLE MONTH OF MY PRESIDENCY, WE HAVE ADDED JOBS. A TOTAL OF 10 MILLION NEW JOBS. 750,000 OF THEM ARE MANUFACTURING JOBS. YOU HAVE HEARD ME SAY IT BEFORE, WHERE IS IT WRITTEN AN AMERICA CAN'T LEAD THE WORLD IN MANUFACTURING? BY THE WAY, REMEMBER I TALKED AT LENGTH ABOUT THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. LOOK WHAT'S GOING ON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND THE NUCLEAR FRONT. THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD NEWS ON THE HORIZON. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS DOWN 6.4%. WHEN I WAS SWORN IN. IT'S NOW 3.7%, NEAR A 50-YEAR LOW. WE HAVE DONE ALL OF THIS WHILE LOWERING THE FEDERAL DEFICIT IN THE TWO YEARS WE HAVE BEEN IN OFFICE. LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN. $1.7 TRILLION WE HAVE LOWERED THE FEDERAL DEBT. NO ADMINISTRATION HAS EVER CUT THAT MUCH. NOW INFLATION IS COMING DOWN AS WELL. PRICE OF THINGS LIKE TELEVISIONS AND TOYS ARE GOING DOWN. THAT'S GOOD NEWS FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON. USED CAR RICES FELL FOR THE FIFTH MONTH IN A ROW. THAT SAVINGS IS CRITICAL TO SO MANY FAMILIES AND GIVES THEM A LITTLE BIT OF BREATHING ROOM FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON. AND ALL OF THIS MEANS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS, WAGES HAVE GONE UP MORE THAN PRICES HAVE GONE UP. WAGES HAVE GONE UP MORE THAN PRICES HAVE GONE UP. I WANT TO BE CLEAR. IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO GET INFLATION BACK TO NORMAL LEVELS. AS WE MAKE THE TRANSITION TO A MORE STABLE AND STEADY GROWTH. WE CAN SEE SET PACS ALONG THE WAY AS WELL. WE SHOULDN'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED. WHAT IS CLEAR IS THE PLAN IS WORKING AND WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. MY GOAL IS SIMPLE. GET PRICE INCREASES UNDER CONTROL WITHOUT CHOKING OFF ECONOMIC GROWTH. BRING INFLATION DOWN WHILE KEEPING OUR LABOR MARKET RESILIENT. BUILD AN ECONOMY FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND THE MIDDLE OUT. AN ECONOMY WITH GOOD JOBS, GOOD WAGES AND FOR THE LONG RUN, NOT A BOOM OR BUST ECONOMY. BECAUSE OF MY PLAN, WE'RE BEGINING TO SEE HISTORIC INVESTMENTS THAT ARE LEADING COMPANIES TO INVEST HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO BUILD SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORIES AND OTHER ADVANCED MANUFACTURING HERE IN AMERICA. IT'S GOING TO CREATE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF GOOD-PAYING JOBS. BY THE WAY, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE JOBS ARE EXPECTED TO BE JOBS THAT PAY $125,000 A YEAR. MANY DON'T REQUIRE A COLLEGE DEGREE. SO THINGS ARE LOOKING UP. WHAT'S NEXT? BECAUSE OF MY PLAN, WE'RE TAKING POWERFUL ACTION TO LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS AND HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND ENERGY BILLS. IN JUST A FEW WEEKS STARTING IN JANUARY, FAMILIES WILL GET A LITTLE MORE BREATHING ROOM. THEY HAVE BEEN TOLD FOR SOME TIME SINCE WE PASSED THE LEGISLATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOWER THE PRICE OF DRUGS. LET ME GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE. COMING JANUARY 1, SENIORS WITH DIABETES ON MEDICARE ARE GOING TO PAY NO MORE THAN $35 A MONTH FOR PRESCRIPTION OF INSULIN. UP TO NOW, THEY HAVE BEEN PAY ING $400 A MONTH. THAT'S A GENUINE SAVINGS FOR SENIORS. THIS MATTERS TO MANY FAMILIES WITH LOVED ONES WHO HAVE DIABETES AND RELY ON INSULIN TO SURVIVE. GOING FROM $400 TO $35 A MONTH. IN JANUARY THEY WON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING THEIR INSULIN, AND IN MANY CASES PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. IT MATTERS. IT'S REAL SAVE TOGS PEOPLE. AND IT'S JUST ABOUT TO KICK IN. THE SAME IS TRUE FROM HEALTH CARE TO CLEAN ENERGY. BY TAKING ACTION, WE'RE MAKING REAL PROGRESS IN STRENGTHENING AND STABILIZING OUR ECONOMY, GIVING AMERICANS SOME BREATHING ROOM IN THE PROCESS. LOOK, I KNOW IT'S BEEN A ROUGH FEW YEARS FOR HARD-WORKING AMERICANS AND FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL. FOR A LOT OF FOLKS, THINGS ARE STILL PRETTY ROUGH. BUT THERE ARE BRIGHT SPOTS ALL ACROSS AMERICA, WHERE WE'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE IMPACT OF OUR ECONOMIC STRATEGY. WE'RE JUST GETTING STARTED. I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE. I HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICA'S FUTURE. TODAY'S NEWS GIVES ME EVEN MORE REASON. WE'RE BUILDING A BETTER AMERICA, AN ECONOMY FROM THE BOTTOM UP AND THE MIDDLE OUT. NOT THE TOP DOWN. WHEN THE POOR HAVE A SHOT, MIDDLE CLASS DO WELL, THE WEALTHY ALWAYS DO VERY WELL. WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP GOING. I KNOW WE CAN GET THIS DONE. GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND MAY GOD PROTECT YOUR TROOPS. I'M GOING TO BE SEEING YOU ALL A LITTLE LATER THIS AFTERNOON. I'M NOT TAKING ANY QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  HOPE BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR, I CAN'T MAKE THAT PREDICTION.  DO YOU PLAN TO VETO OVER THE REQUIREMENT?  PRESIDENT BIDEN AT THE COMMENTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE LIVE ON MSNBC. I WANT TO GO BACK TO WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT MIKE MEMOLI. THE PRESIDENT DISPLAYING OPTIMISM. ALSO HE HAS A BUSY DAY TODAY.  THAT'S RIGHT. AS YOU LISTEN TO THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS ON THE ECONOMY THERE, I THINK ABOUT TWO WORDS. BALANCE AND CONTEXT. THE PRESIDENT REALLY TRYING TO TOUT WHAT HE SEES AS GOOD TREND LINES IN TAMING INFLATION ALONGSIDE OTHER GOOD INDICATORS, BUT ALSO BALANCING THAT OUT WITH WHAT HE UNDERSTANDS IS STILL A TOUGH TIME FOR MANY AMERICANS WITH PRICES STILL ON THE RISE. HE'S ALSO TRYING TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT SAYING THAT THE INFLATION HERE IN THE UNITED STATES IS ACTUALLY FAR BELOW WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN SOME OTHER WORLD COUNTRIES AS THE WHITE HOUSE CONTINUES TO TRY TO STRESS THAT SOME OF THESE PRESSURES ON PRICES HERE ARE GLOBAL TRENDS. BUT HE ALSO PUTS THIS IN CONTEXT. AS I THINK ABOUT WHAT THIS PRESIDENT IS HEADING IN THE NEXT MONTH, POTENTIALLY ANNOUNCING A REELECTION CAMPAIGN, YOU HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WHAT THE ECONOMY WAS LIKE AT WHEN HE INHERITED IT AS PRESIDENT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO AND WHAT HE SEES NOW BUILDING A BETTER AMERICA, WHICH IS SOMETHING OF A CAMPAIGN SLOGAN. HE TALKED ABOUT A BUSY DAY FOR THE PRESIDENT. HE REFERRED TO AN EVENT THIS AFTERNOON WHERE HE'S GOING TO SIGN INTO LAW THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT. THIS IS A FOLLOW-UP TO WHAT WE SAW IN THE DOBBS DECISION IN WHICH MANY ARE CONCERNED THAT OTHER RIGHTS, NOT JUST ABORTION RIGHT, BUT SAME-SEX MARRIAGE RIGHTS ARE UNDER ATTACK. THIS MEASURE ATTEMPTS TO CONTINUE TO OFFER SOME PROTECTIONS TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO REFER TO COMMENTS HE MADE AS VICE PRESIDENT TEN YEARS AGO, IN WHICH HE GOT AHEAD OF THE PRESIDENT HE SERVED UNDER IN EXPRESSING HIS SUPPORT FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY. SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT IN THE MAINSTREAM IN THE WAY IT IS NOW. THE PRESIDENT IS GOING TO BE USING THAT MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT THE LONG STRIDES WE HAVE SEEN IN MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND SAME-SEX MARRIAGE RIGHTS AND THE OTHER CHALLENGES THAT REMAIN AHEAD FOR LGBTQ EQUALITY.  MIKE MEMOLI, THANK YOU SO MUCH. > MOMENTS AGO, THE ENERGY SECRETARY ANNOUNCED A MAJOR SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGH THAT COULD PAVE THE WAY FOR CLEAN ENERGY IN THE FUTURE. FOR THE FIRST TIME, RESEARCHERS AT THE LAWRENCE LIVER MORE LAB HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE A FUSION REACTION THAT CREATED MORE ENERGY THAN IT TOOK TO MAKE IT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS SEEN AS A BREAKTHROUGH BECAUSE THIS TECHNOLOGY REPLICATES THE WAY THE SUN PRODUCES ENERGY WITHOUT LONG-LIVED RADIOACTIVE WASTE OR FOSSIL FUEL EMISSIONS. SECRETARY GRANHOLM ADDRESSED THE HISTORIC NATURE OF THE ACHIEVEMENT.  IT'S THE FIRST TIME IT HAS EVER BEEN DONE IN A LABORATORY. ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. SIMPLY PUT, THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SCIENTIFIC FEATS OF THE 21st CENTURY.  JOINING US NOW IS HAKEEM LASAY, A PROFESSOR AT GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY, AS WELL AS THE AUTHOR OF \"A KWUN ITEM LIFE.\" PROFESSOR, IT'S GREAT SEEING YOU. CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO US EXACTLY WHAT THIS DEVELOPMENT IS?  THIS IS SORT OF THE HOLY GRAIL OF ENERGY RESEARCH. ALBERT EINSTEIN WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO REALIZE THAT WHAT WE CALL MASS MAY NOT EXIST. IT COULD BE CONFINED ENERGY. WE NOW KNOW THAT'S TRUE. THE PROTON, 99% OF WHAT WE CALL MASS IS ENERGY. SO WE KNOW NOW THAT IF WE CAN GET THAT ENERGY OUT, WE HAVE AN ABUNDANT SOURCE OF ENERGY THAT WILL BLOW AWAY ANYTHING ON EARTH. THERE'S MORE ENERGY IN A CUP OF WATER THAN THERE IS IN SOMETHING LIKE A MILLION POUNDS OF COAL. I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS EXACT, BUT IT'S EXTREME LIKE THAT. SO THIS IS THE FIRST BREAKTHROUGH THAT LEADS US TO THAT POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF UNLIMITED, CLEAN, CHEAP ENERGY.  SO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE? I'M JUST KIND OF STILL DIGESTING THE WHOLE THERE MAY NOT BE ANY MASS AT ALL. THAT'S MY OWN ISSUE. SO WHAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE, PROFESSOR?  SO ONCE YOU HAVE THIS BREAKTHROUGH, NOW IT'S A MATTER OF ENGINEERING TO MAKE THE PROCESS MORE EFFICIENT. THEN THE QUESTION GOES HOW DO I GO FROM PRODUCING A ABUNDANT AMOUNTS OF HEAT TO PRODUCING ELECTRICITY. THERE WAS A STEP IN BETWEEN. SO USUALLY A COAL POWER PLANT, URANIUM NUCLEAR PLANT THAT WE DON'T THINK OF, THEY USE THAT HEAT TO BOIL WATER AND THE WATER TURNS TO TURBINE. THE SYSTEM THAT THEY HAVE NOW IS NOT EFFICIENT ENOUGH TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY. IT'S NOT EVEN DESIGNED TO DO THAT. BUT ONCE YOU HAVE THIS BREAKTHROUGH, YOU KNOW THAT THE MAIN BARRIER THAT YOU HAVE TO OVERCOME, THE MAIN TECHNOLOGICAL BARRIER HAS NOW BEEN DEFEATED IT'S NOW A MATTER OF MAKING IT MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND ALSO EXTRACTING THAT ENERGY TO CREATE ELECTRICITY WITH IT.  SO WHERE IS THE ENERGY EXTRACTED FROM?  EXACTLY. SO HERE'S -- THEY TAKE THEES ISOTOPES OF HYDROGEN. THEY GET THEM VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER BY A VERY COMPLICATED PROCESS OF TAKING LASERS THAT HIT A METAL CANISTER AROUND IT. THAT METAL CANISTER THEN PRODUCES KPRAS THAT BOMBARD A FUEL PELLET AND THAT CAUSES STUFF TO GO OUTWARD AT THE SURFACE OF THE PELT AND BECAUSE OF EVERY ACTION THERE'S A REACTION, THE CENTER IMPLODES IMWARDLY. YOU'RE FORCING PROTONS TO STICK TOGETHER, USING THE STRONG FORCE. SO IF YOU TAKE TWO PROTONS SEPARATELY, AND THEN YOU COMBINE THEM, THE THING THAT YOU HAVE WHEN YOU COMBINE IT WEIGHS LESS THAN WHAT YOU HAD BEFORE. WHERE DID THAT EXTRA MASS GO? IT WAS CONVERTED INTO ENERGY. AND WHAT THAT EQUATION TELLS YOU IS THAT FOR EVERY UNIT OF MASS THAT YOU CONVERT TO ENERGY, YOU GET THREE TIMES UNITS OF ENERGY OUT. SO THAT'S A LOT OF ENERGY. WASN'T UNIT OF MASS IS A ENERGY. SO THIS IS SIMILAR TO HA WHAT \"STAR TREK\" USES. SO THIS TRULY IS THE HOLY GRAIL OF EXTRACTING ENERGY FROM MATTER.  I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THIS. IT'S FASCINATING. I COULD LISTEN TO YOU FOREVER ON THIS BECAUSE I UNDERSTOOD LIKE 75% OF YOUR INCREDIBLE DESCRIPTION. BUT IT MADE TOTAL SENSE. SO I THANK YOU SO MUCH BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST DISH DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DO IT, BUT YOU DO IT. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US THIS MORNING.  THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I LOVE IT.  LIKE WISE. THANKS. > NEW POLLING SHOWS SUPPORT FOR DONALD TRUMP'S 2024 RUN PLUMMETING AMONG REPUBLICANS. SO IT'S NOT TRUMP, WHO? WE'LL TALK TO SUNSHINE WHO IS REALLY WELL VERSED IN THIS ISSUE.

        "trs": "> ABORTION RIGHTS PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE THIS THIS YEAR'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, BUT IT'S NOT ONLY IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE IT LOOMS LARGE AS AN ISSUE. PRESIDENT OBAMA LANCE HAS SOME OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AMONG WESTERN COUNTRIES. LET'S BRING IN NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT MATT BRADLEY. YOU RECENTLY TRAVELLED TO POLAND TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS. WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?  THAT'S RIGHT. FOR 30 YEARS PRESIDENT OBAMA LAPD'S STRICT ANTIABORTION LAWS HAD ALREADY SET THE COUNTRY APART FROM ITS NEIGHBOR, BUT A COURT DECISION TWO YEARS AGO TIGHTENED THEM EVEN FURTHER. THE CHANGE TO ABORTION LAWS IN POLAND AND NOW IN THE UNITED STATES HAVED GLOBAL TRENDS. STRONGLY CATHOLIC COUNTRIES LIKE IRELAND, ARGENTINA AND CHILE HAVE MOVED TO LIBERALIZE THEIR ABORTION LAWS. ONLY THE U.S. AND POLAND HAVE TIGHTENED THEM. THAT'S EXPOSED TO POLITICAL KINSHIP. TWO NATIONS WHERE A POWERFUL RELIGIOUS RIGHT WING HAVE RESORTED TO COURTS RATHER THAN LEGISLATURES TO RESTRICT ABORTION. AS I FOUND OUT WHEN I WENT TO POLAND A FEW WEEKS AGO, THE COURT DECISIONS HAVEN'T ENDED THE DEBATE. THEY HAVE ONLY MADE THIS ISSUE MORE FRAUGHT AND IN SOMES CASES HAD A CHILLING EFFECT ON THE DOCTORS PROVIDING EVEN LEGAL ABORTIONS.  SHE REALLY DIED SO YOUNG.  SHE HAD MANY PLANS FOR THE FUTURE AND WE CANNOT ACCEPT THAT THIS LIFE IS TAKEN.  Reporter: SHE LIVED AS A HAIR ETC. DRESSER AND MOTHER, BUT HER DEATH AT ONLY 30 YEARS OLD MADE HER A POLITICAL MARTER. SHE DIED LAST YEAR OF ACCEPT SIS, BUT HER FAMILY CONSIDERS HER A CASUALTY OF POLAND'S CULTURE WAR. HER SISTER-IN-LAW SAYS AN ABORTION COULD HAVE SAVED HER LIFE. HER BABY HAD HAD SEVERE JET NET YOU CAN DEFECTS AND WAS UNLIKELY TO SURVIVE, BUT DOCTORS WORRIED THEY COULD FACE CRIMINAL CHARGES UNDER SOME OF THE MOST RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAWS IN EUROPE.  DO YOU BELIEVE THE COURT DECISION DIRECTLY LED TO HER DEATH?  Translator: YES, OF COURSE, THE LAW CHANGED AND THE DOCTORS WERE TOO SCARED TO DO ANYTHING. BUT THEY HAVE A DUTY TO SAVE LIVES.  Reporter: HER TEXT MESSAGES FROM THE HOSPITAL REVEAL HER DESPERATE FINAL HOURS. MY LIFE IS IN DANGER, SHE WROTE. THEY CAN'T HELP AS LONG AS THE FETUS IS ALIVE THANKS TO THE ANTIABORTION LAW. I HAVE TO GIVE BIRTH TO A DEAD BABY. THIS SAYS, NOT ONE MORE. SO YOU KIND OF TURNED HER GRAVE INTO A POLITICAL MONUMENT.  Translator: YES, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN AGAIN TO ANOTHER FAMILY.  Reporter: HER FAMILY ISN'T AALONE. HER DEATH SPARKED PROTESTS THROUGHOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA LAND. ACCORDING TO A POLL IN 2020, TWO-THIRDS OF POLISH PEOPLE BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE LEGAL DURING THE FIRST TRY MIDWESTER. ABORTION HAS BEEN ILLEGAL HERE SINCE 1993, EXCEPT FOR CASES OF RAPE, INCEST OR MORTAL THREAT TO THE MOTHER'S LIFE. TERMINATIONS HAD BEEN ALLOWED IN CASES OF FETUS ABNORMALITIES. THE LAW CHANGED IN 2020 WHEN THE COUNTRY'S HIGHEST COURT STACKED WITH CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES OUTLAWED WORGSSS FOR FETAL ABNORMALITIES REDUCING ALREADY RARE LEGAL ABORTIONS BY 90%, ACCORDING TO ABORTION RIGHTS GROUPS.  IS THIS LAW KILLING WUM?  YES, THIS LAW HAS BEEN KILLING WOMEN AND WE SAY NO ONE MORE.  Reporter: POLISH WOMEN IN THE EARLY STAMGS OF PREGNANCY HAVE INCREASINGLY TURNED TO ABORTION PILLS. OTHERS TO EXPENSIVE TRIPS TO CLINICS ELSEWHERE IN EUROPE.  IT CAUSES THE REPRODUCTIVE INDUSTRIES, BECAUSE WOMEN WITH MONEY, EDUCATED, WORKING IN BIG TOWNS, THEY HAVE ACCESS INFORMATION. THEY CAN EASILY HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE PRODUCTIVE HEALTH SERVICES, INCLUDING SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTIONS. BUT FOR MAJORITY OF WOMEN, IT IS THOT ACCESSIBLE.  Reporter: ANTIABORTION ACTIVISTS BLAME ISABELLA'S DOCTORS, NOT THE LAW, FOR HER DEATH. THE HOSPITAL SAYS IT SUSPENDED TWO DOCTORS PENDING AN INVESTIGATION AND THREE DOCTORS ARE FACING CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR THEIR INVOLVEMENT. TRAGEDIES LIKE ISABEL'S ARE STILL RARE.  DID YOU BELIEVE THE LAW SHOULD APPLY?  AT 14 WEEKS THERE'S ALREADY A HEARTBEATING. THERE'S A NERVOUS SYSTEM. YES, I WOULDN'T CONSIDER IT IN RELIGIOUS LAW, IT'S JUST HUMAN LAW. THERE'S A HUMAN BEING AND THIS IS THE MAIN ISSUE.  Reporter: PARENT WHO IS MIGHT OTHERWISE SEEK AN ABORTION ARE COUNSELLED. WHEN THEIR UNBORN SON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A TERMINAL ILLNESS.  WE NEVER CONSIDERED TO KILL OUR BABY. IF WE PLAN TO HAVE A BABY.  ACTUALLY, THAT WAS BECAUSE OF OUR FAITH. WE ARE CHRISTIANS.  Reporter: SHE COULD HAVE LEAVE LOOELLY ABORTED SAMUEL AND INSTEAD CHOSE TO CARRY HIM TO TERM.  THAT MUST HAVE BEEN DEVASTATING. HE WAS ONLY ALIVE FOR 30 MINUTES AFTER YOU GAVE BIRTH.  I WAS HOLDING HIM IN MY HANDS AND ACTUALLY HE DIED AT THAT TIME.  YOUR ARMS?  YES, IN MY ARMS. I WAS SUTING AND CRYING.  I'M SORRY.  Reporter: THEY INSIST THEY DON'T REGRET THEIR DECISION, BUT IN MATTERS OF LAW, THEY ARE LESS CERTAIN.  YOU MADE YOUR VERY DIFFICULT CHOICE. A LOT OF POLISH WOMEN WOULD SAY THEY DON'T HAVE THAT CHOICE WAUZ OF THE LAW. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM?  I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.  IT'S NOT A SOLUTION.  Reporter: A LAW MEANT TO PRESERVE LIFE THAT'S LEFT A LEGACY OF DEATH AND POLITICAL DIVISION.  SO AS YOU CAN SEE, WHEN IT COMES TO ABORTION, THERE ARE SEVERAL PARALLELS BETWEEN POLAND AND THE UNITED STATES. JUST LIKE MANY AMERICAN WOMEN, WOMEN IN STATES WHERE ABORTIONS ARE ABOUT TO BECOME UL LEGAL, POLISH WOMEN CAN STILL GET ABORTIONS BUT THEY NEED TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF OF THE COUNTRY TO EVALUATE ELS WHERE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, SOMETHING THAT PUTTINGS THE PROCEDURE OUT OF REACH FOR HAD MANYWOMEN. SOMETHING I DIDN'T MENTION IN THAT PIECE, WOMEN IN POLAND CAN LEGALLY GET AN ABORTION IN CASES OF RA RAPE INCEST UP TO 12 WEEKS. BUT TO DO SO, THOSE WOMEN NEED TO SECURE A CERTIFIED LETTER FROM A PUBLIC PROSECUTOR ATTESTING THE FACT BEEN THE VICTIM OF A CRIME. THAT'S REALLY QUITE AN ONEROUS REQUIREMENT. BORGT RIGHTS GROUPS CLAIM THAT MAKES THE PROCEDURE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR RAPE VICTIMS.  IT DOES FOR MOST OF THEM. MATT BRADLEY, THANK YOU FOR THAT REPORT. GREAT PIECE. REALLY APPRECIATE IT. > THAT DOES IT FOR US THIS MORNING. JOSE DIAZ-BALART PICKS UP THE COVERAGE IN ONE MINUTE.

        "trs": "> SO WE ARE ABOUT A MONTH OUT FROM THE MIDTERM ELECTS NOW. GEORGIA HAS HAD TIME TO DO THE U.S. SENATE RUN OFF. CALIFORNIA HAS HAD THE MULTIPLE WEEKS IT ALWAYS TAKES THEM.  TODAY GET VOTES COUNTED. AND WE HAVE GOT THROUGH TO THE END OF THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. SO WE CAN BOTTOM LINE IT. THE BOTTOM LINE IS IN THIS YEAR'S MIDTERM ELECT REPUBLICANS DID TERRIBLY. THEY HAD A HISTORICALLY TERRIBLE SHOWING. I MEAN, AND I MEAN THAT IN A TECHNICAL SENSE. HISTORICALLY SPEAKING IN THE FIRST ELECTION, AFTER A NEW PRESIDENT HAS MOVED INTO THE WHITE HOUSE, THAT PRESIDENT'S PARTY GETS SLACKED IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. AND YOU KNOW, DON'T ASK ME WHY. IT'S WHAT AMERICAN VOTERS LIKE TO DO. THEY LIKE A CANDIDATE AND A PARTY ENOUGH TO PUT THEM IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND IMMEDIATELY NEXT CHANCE THEY GET TWO YEARS LATER THEY CHANGE THE PREFERENCE TO THE OTHER PARTIES CONTROLLING CONGRESS. I DON'T KNOW WHY IT GOES THIS WAY, BUT IT ALWAYS GOES THIS WAY. IF YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY SINCE WORLD WAR II, THE PARTY THAT IS NOT THE PRESIDENT'S PARTY HAS PICKED UP AN AVERAGE OF 26 SEATS IN THE HOUSE. IN THE MID TERM ELECTS. THE AVERAGE SINCE WORLD WAR II IS 26 SEATS. AND RECENTLY, IT'S BEEN WORST. IN PRESIDENT'S TRUMP MIDTERM DEMOCRATS PICKED UP 40 SEATS AND PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST MIDTERM REPUBLICANS PICKED UP 63 SEATS. AND THAT HISTORICAL DATA IS PRESUMABLY WHY REPUBLICANS, AHEAD OF THE MIDTERMS, WERE CROWING ABOUT THE FACT THEY WILL PICK UP POE, 40, 50, 60 MORE SEATS THAN THAT. NOW THE RESULTS ARE IN, AND NOW WE KNOW, TURNS OUT THE REPUBLICANS GOT 9 SEATS. 9 TOTA SEATS. THEY DIDN'T HIT DOUBLE DIGITS. THAT'S A HISTORIC WIPE OUT. AND THE OTHER SIDE, THE DEMOCRATS GAINED A SEAT IN THE SENATE. TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY. BUT THE REPUBLICANS WERE EXPECTING TO DO WELL UP AND DOWN THE TICKET. THEY WERE EXPECTING TO DO GREAT IN GOVERNORS RACE, EXPECTED TO DO GREAT IN STATE LEGISLATURES AND THOUGHT THEY WOULD FLIP SOME FROM DEMOCRAT TO REPUBLICAN AND THEY DIDN'T DO THAT EITHER ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. THIS TURNED OUT TO BE THE FIRST MIDTERM SINCE THE 1930s THAT THE OPPOSITION PARTY DIDN'T FLIP A SINGLE STATEHOUSE OR STATE SENATE. AND IN FACT, THE DEMOCRATS WERE THE PARTY THAT FLIPPED FOUR STATE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS BOTH HOUSES IN MICHIGAN, HOUSE IN PENNSYLVANIA AND SENATE IN MINNESOTA. IT WENT AGAINST REPUBLICANS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IN ALL KINDS OF RACES. LOOK AT WISCONSIN AND IN KANSAS. IN BOTH THOSE STATES, REPUBLICANS HAD CONTROL OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE. THEY WERE A TOTAL LOOK TO STAY IN CONTROL OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE. BUT ON TOP OF THAT THEY WERE CONFIDENT THEY WOULD GET RID OF THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS IN BOTH OF THE STATES IN BOTH KANSAS AND WISCONSIN. THERE BY FULL REPUBLICAN CONTROL OF THE BOTH STATES REPUBLICANS EXPECTED THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY, BY THIS POINT RIGHT NOW, THEY WOULD HAVE NOT ONLY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUT THE WHOLE STATE LEGISLATURE IN BOTH WISCONSIN AND KANSAS. IN WISCONSIN AND KANSAS, AS IT TURNS OUT, REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR BOTH LOST. TO DEMOCRATS. SO THE REPUBLICANS WERE NOT ABLE TO A GET FULL CONTROL OF THE STATES EVEN THOUGH THEY FULLY EXPECTED TO. IT WAS ACTUALLY THE DEMOCRATS IN THE ELECTION WHO GOT FULL CONTROL AND THE GOVERNORSHIP AND BOTH HOUSES OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN FOUR STATES. WHERE THEY DIDN'T HAVE IT BEFORE. FOUR STATES YOU CAN REMEMBER WITH THIS EASY DEVICE. BECAUSE IT'S FOUR STATES THAT START WITH M. MASSACHUSETTS, MARYLAND, MINNESOTA, MICHIGAN. ALL FOUR STATES THE DEMOCRATS DID NOT PREVIOUSLY CONTROL THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUT AFTER THE MID TERM ELECT, NOW THEY DO. AND AGAIN, THIS IS AN ELECTION WHERE HISTORICALLY SPEAKING, THE PRESIDENT'S PARTY, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SHOULD HAVE BEEN WIPED OUT ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT THEY MADE UP THE GROUND. THE WASHINGTON POST CRUNCH THE NUMBERS ON WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERM OF THE U.S. POPULATION IN TERMS OF WHICH PARTY IS IN CONTROL OF WHICH STATES. THEY FOUND THAT THE RESULTS OF THIS ELECTION, WHICH WAS HISTORICALLY HORRIBLE FOR REPUBLICANS AND SHOCKINGLY GOOD FOR DEMOCRATS, THEY FOUND THE OVERALL TOP LINE RESULT, THANKS TO HOW WELL THINGS WENT FOR DEMOCRATS IN THE STATE, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN DECADE, MORE AMERICANS NEXT YEAR WILL LIVE IN STATES WITH FULL DEMOCRATIC CONTROL THAN IN STATES WITH FULL REPUBLICAN CONTROL. 140 MILLION AMERICANS AS OF NEXTEE LIVE IN BLUE, BLUE, BLUE STATES WHERE THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ARE CONTROLLED BY THE DEMOCRATS. 140 MILLION IN BLUE STATES. AS OPPOSED TO 131 MILLION IN RED STATES. THE REPUBLICANS CONTROL BOTH THE THINGS. MORE AMERICANS WILL LIVE IN BLUE STATES THAN RED STATES IN TERMS OF WHICH PARTY HAS TOTAL CONTROL. AND THAT IS -- THAT'S PROFOUNDLY IMPORTANT. NOT JUST FOR MATHEMATICALLY KEEPING SCORE BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND POINTING AND GASPING HOW POORLY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DID. IT'S IMPORTANT IN REAL LIFE. IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE SO MUCH POLICIES THAT'S RELEVANT TO PEOPLE'S LIVES IS DECIDED BY WHO'S IN CONTROL AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND EVERYTHING FROM WHETHER OR NOT ABORTION IS LEGAL, THANK YOU SUPREME COURT. TO WHETHER YOU CAN GET HEALTH INSURANCE OR GET MEDICAID, HOW WELL TEACHERS ARE PAID. ROAD REPAIRS, LEGAL POT, VOTING RIGHTS AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. REPUBLICANS DID HISTORICALLY BAD THIS YEAR, AND DEMOCRATS DID HISTORICALLY WELL. AND SO MORE AMERICANS WILL LIVE IN DEMOCRATIC CONTROLLED STATES NEXT YEAR THAN IN REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED STATES. AND THAT IS HUGELY CONSEQUENTIAL. AND, WE NOW KNOW AS OF TODAY, THAT THE SURPRISING ELECTION RESULTS THIS YEAR MAY HAVE BEEN SHAPED IN PART BY A VERY LARGE PREVIOUSLY SECRET PRODEMOCRACY INVESTMENT IN THIS YEAR'S ELECTION. IT PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN INHE VESTMENT OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WAS MADE WITHOUT ANY PUBLICITY AND PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT DURING THE MIDTERM ELECTS. WE DID NOT KNOW ABOUT IT UNTIL TODAY BUT IT'S TENS OF MILLIONS SPENT IN 16 STATES, INCLUDING ALL THE STATES I MENTIONED, AND IT WAS SPENT ON LOCAL EFFORTS TO STOP EFFORTS TO LIMIT VOTING AND TO GET PEOPLE OUT TO THE POLLS, AND I MEAN, TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ALL SPENT IN THE STATES ALL ON PRO DEMOCRACY EFFORTS UNKNOWN UNTIL TODAY. WHO DID IT? AND WHY AND HOW AND IS THAT PART WHY THE ELECTION RESULTS THIS YEAR BLEW EVERYBODY'S MINDS AND CHANGED HISTORY. THE ANSWER TO THAT RIDEL TO THAT MYSTERY AND WHO DONE IT IS NEXT.

TOTALLY NEW HEADLINE INSIDE THE SECRET $32 MILLION TO STOP, STOP THE STEAL. A PAIR OF PROGRESSIVE OPERATIONS OPERATING IN SECRECY SPEARHEADED A $32 MILLION CAMPAIGN DURING THE MIDTERMS TO PUSH BACK AGAINST FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S STOP THE STEAL MOVEMENT. THE GROUPS OPERATED IN STATES AS THE ELECTION SYSTEM FACED UNPRECEDENTED PRESSURE FROM TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES WHO FALSELY SAID THE 2020 ELEB WAS STOLEN. THE ORGANIZATION FUNDED 126 GROUPS ACROSS 16 STATES. FROM BATTLEGROUND LIKE ARIZONA AND PENNSYLVANIA TO PLACE LIKE SOUTH CAROLINA AND NEW JERSEY. THE GROUP INTENTION AGOLY OPERATED BEHIND THE SCENES THROUGHOUT THE MID TERM ELECTION CYCLINGEL, NOT CONDUCTING MEDIA OUTREACH OR EVEN LAUNCHING A PUBLIC FACING WEBSITE. POLITICO IS THE FIRST TO REPORT ON THE GROUP'S EXISTENCE AND THEIR EXTENSIVE FUNDING OF THE SCORES OF GROUPS. DAVID DONELLY PROGRESSIVE OP AT THIS TIMETIVE SAID IT WAS CLEAR THERE WAS A MOBILIZED CONSTITUENCY THAT CARED ABOUT DEMOCRACY ON THE WRONG SIDE. HE SAID THE GOAL WAS TO BRING PEOPLE TO THE FIGHT NOT JUST BRING MORE POLE OR LAWYERS TO BRING MORE PEOPLE TO THE FIGHT. WE DECIDED IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO FUND A BUNCH OF ELECTION PROTECTION EFFORTS OR CANDIDATES TO RUN AGAINST ELECTION DENIERS HE SAID. WE NEEDED TO FUND ORGANIZES INFRASTRUCTURE TO BRING MORE HEFT TO THE BATTLES ON DEMOCRACY. MORE HEFT. TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MORE HEFT. JOINING US NOW IS DAVID DONNELLY VETERAN PROGRESSIVE OPERATIVE BEHIND PRODEMOCRACY CAMPAIGN WHICH I HAVE TO CHECK BECAUSE THEY ARE ORGANIZATION I NEVER HEARD OF BEFORE TODAY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE.  THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME, RACHEL.  CAN YOU PUT A LITTLE BIT OF MEAT ON THE BONES HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT EXACTLY YOU FUNDED. THIS IS A LOT MONEY TO HAVE PUT INTO THIS ELECTION CYCLE. WHAT WERE YOU FUNDING AND WHAT WERE YOUR PRIORITIES?  FIRST, LET ME SAY THAT I BELIEVE THERE'S A CAST OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO HELPED TO DELIVER THE ELECTION RESULTS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I THINK AMERICANS STOOD UP FOR DEMOCRACY, AND AGAINST THOSE THAT WOULD TAKE US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND WE TOOK DEMOCRACY. THE KIND OF WORK THAT OUR PARTNERS DID, AND FRANKLY, I THINK A LOT OF CREDIT BELONGS TO THE 126 GROUPS THAT WE SUPPORTED, THE KIND OF WORK THEY DID, SPANNED US THE SPECTRUM FROM VOTER REGISTRATION DRIVE AND TURNING OUT VOTES AND ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THEY ADVOCATED WITH ELECTION CLERKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE LONGER HOURS TO CAST BALLOTS. THEY ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO REACH OUT TO NEIGHBORS AND TO YOU KNOW EXPAND AND THEY WORKED ON BALLOT QUESTIONS, THEY WORKED ON OTHER KINDS OF POLICY FIGHTS TO MAKE OUR DEMOCRACY MORE REFLECTIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO ALL OF US.  THE THING THAT -- WELL TWO THINGS SEEM NOTABLE ABOUT THIS EFFORT AND THE WAY WE ARE LEARNING ABOUT IT. ONE, IS THAT THIS IS NOT -- DOES NOT SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN A LET'S CREATE A BIG NEW NATIONAL ORGANIZATION TO TRAIN OPERATIVE CENTRALLY AND DISPATCH THEM INTO THE STATES, WHICH I THINK IS A LOT OF WHAT WE IMAGINED A BIG WELL FUND NATIONAL TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EFFORT WOULD BE LIKE. THIS IS SUPPORTING EXISTING ORGANIZATIONS IN STATES AND COMMUNITIES. SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT AS A STRATEGY. BUT THE OTHER REASON THAT I AM TALKING TO YOU AND I THINK IT'S GETTING ATTENTION IS WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS UNTIL AFTER THE ELEB WAS OVER. WHY WAS THIS SUCH A LOW PROFILE EFFORT? WHY WERE THERE NO PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. WHY AREN'T WE FINDING OUT ABOUT IT UNTIL NOW?  WE DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD PROMOTE WORK BEFORE WE DID IT. WE ARE UNDER THE IMPRESSION YOU SHOULD PROVE YOURSELF IN THE WORLD BEFORE YOU CLAIM ANY CREDIT FOR THE WORK YOU'VE DONE, AND WE THOUGHT THAT THE ORGANIZATIONAL PARTNERS IN THE STATES WERE DOING THE HARD WORK, AND THEY ARE THE ONES THAT SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE WORK. AND MANY GOT GREAT PRESS COVERAGE ABOUT ALL THE WORK THEY DID TO ENGAGE IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AND YOUNG VOTERS, AND WORK ON POLICY. AND WE THINK THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT STORY TO TELL THAN THE WORK THAT WE DID. AND YOU KNOW, WE DID WORK WITHIN THE EXISTING ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES. WE DIDN'T SET UP A LOT OF NEW ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY ARE GREAT ORGANIZATIONS WORKING IN COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. THEY NEEDED MORE RESOURCES. THERE'S A -- I DID A DEEP DIVE IN THE STATES IN THE SUMMER OF '21 TO HEAR FROM LEADERS OF LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AND STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS, AND THERE WAS AN APPETITE TO WORK ON DEMOCRACY ON OVER THE LONG TERP, BUT THERE WAS ALSO A FEAR THAT UNLESS THEY GOT TO WORK URGENTLY TO TACKLE AND BEAT BACK THE TAX AGAINST THEIR ABILITY TO CAST BALLOTS, THEN WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE A LONG- TERM TO FIGHT FOR. SO, WE SET OUT TO HELP SUPPORT THEM. IN THE NEAR TERM BUT TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE WORKING IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES AND AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE, TO HAVE A STRONGER LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE QUESTIONS OF DEMOCRACY OVER TIME.  BECAUSE YOU DECIDED AS YOU SAY, TO SHOW YOUR WORK AND NOT TALK ABOUT YOUR WORK, TO HAVE THIS BE A LOW PROFILE AND SECRETIVE EFFORT DURING THE CAMPAIGN. WHY DO WE KNOW ABOUT IT NOW? WHY GO PUBLIC NOW WITH THE NAMES OF YOUR GROUPS, THE PRODEMOCRACY CAMPAIGN. AND WHY NOW HAVE POLITICO AND TONIGHT \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" DESCRIBE THE KIND OF WORK YOU DID NOW THE ELECTION IS DONE?  WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT STORY TO TELL ABOUT WHAT THE STATE PARTNERS DID ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, THE GRASS ROOTS GROUPS THAT ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY. THERE ARE, AGAIN, A CAST OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY HELPED AVERT US FROM THE DEMOCRATIC COLLAPSE. IT'S NOT JUST THE GROUPS THAT WE FUNDED. IT'S MANY OTHER -- IT'S LITIGATORS AND THOSE THAT DID ELECTION PROTECTION WORK, IT'S THOSE THAT ENGAGED IN ALL SORTS OF OTHER KINDS OF WAYS TO MAKE CHANGE AND TO PULL US BACK. BUT WE BELIEVE IT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO GROUND THE WORK IN THE FRONT LINES OF THOSE THAT ARE BEING ATTACKED AND THOSE THAT HAVE THEIR RIGHTS BEING TAKEN AWAY. AND WE THOUGHT IT WAS CRITICAL TO MAKE SURE THE STORIES WERE TOLD AND WERE PART OF THE ELECTION ROUNDUP THAT WE ARE NOW ENGAGE IN UNDERSTANDING THAT YES, INDEED, WE HAVE A COUNTRY THAT IS MORE PRO DEMOCRACY SLIGHTLY MORE. WE HELD THE LINE. I THINK WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO, BUT WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT THESE GROUPS ARE OUT ENGAGED IN A LOSS OF FIGHTS YET TO COME. THERE'S A WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT RACE IN APRIL. THERE'S A POTENTIAL OF A POLICY MOVING FORWARD IN MINNESOTA BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DESCRIBED EARLIER IN THE SEGMENT, RACHEL, THE FLIP OF THE STATE SENATE. NOW IT WILL ALLOW FOR THERE TO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO POLICY IN MINNESOTA AND OTHER EFFORTS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THAT ARE CRITICAL AND THE GROUPS NEED RESOURCES TO DO THE WORK.

DOWNLOAD ROCKET MONEY TODAY. > THEY DID THIS WHERE THEY CARRIED AROUND A PROP PIPELINE. YOU MAY REMEMBER THE IMAGES IN FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. SEE THE PIPELINE. HERE IT WAS IN NEW YORK CITY. FOR YEARS, YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS MOVEMENT IT WAS BIG WELL ORGANIZED AGGRESSIVELY CREATED CAMPAIGN TO PROTEST KEYSTONE. THE EXPANSION OF THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE WHICH FUNNELED TAR SANDS OIL OUT CANADA AND ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. KEYSTONE IS THE MOST FAMOUS PIPELINE ON THE CONTINENT BECAUSE OF THE MOVEMENT TO STOP IT. AND THE ACTIVISTS ARGUMENT AGAINST PARTICULARLY THE KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE EXPANSION WAS TWOFOLD. AND THEY SAID FIRST, AT THIS POINT IN THE CLIMATE CRISIS WE SHOULD BE LEAVING THE OIL IN THE GROUND. AND NOT BUILDING NEW FUNNEL TO HELP BRING IT TO MARKET AND BURN IT. BUT IT WAS ALSO AN ARGUMENT ABOUT HOW PIPELINES ARE NOT GREAT AT WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. ANTIKEYSTONE ACTIVISTS RAISED THE ALARM ABOUT HOW FOR ALL THE MONEY AND OIL INDUSTRY, EVEN BRAND NEW MODERN OIL PIPELINES LIKE TO LEAK. SO, FIRST OF ALL, KEEP THE OIL IN THE GROUND. AND IF YOU DON'T DO THAT YOU PUT THE OIL IN THE PIPELINE PREPARE FOR DISASTEROUS OIL SPILLS. THAT WAS THE ARGUMENT FROM THE ANTIKEYSTONE ACTIVISTS. WELL WHAT DO YOU KNOW? LAST WEEK THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE SPRUNG A LEAK IN KANSAS THE SIZE OF AN OLYMPIC SWIMMING POOL. CLOSE TO 600,000 GALLONS OF OIL DUMPED OUT OF THE PIPELINE INTO A NEARBY CREEK, AND INTO SOME RURAL PASTURE LAND THE BIGGEST OIL SPIN ON LAND IN THE UNITED STATES IN MORE THAN NINE YEARS. AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE RUPTURED. NOT BY A LONG SHOT INCLUDING THE SPILL FROM THE PAST FEW DAYS, THIS ONE PIPELINE THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE SPRUNG A LEAK 23 TIMES. IN THE LAST 12 YEARS. AND THE LEAKS ARE GETTING BIGGER. MORE OIL OUT OF THE PIPELINE IN KANSAS THAN IN ALL THE PREVIOUS 22 SPILLS COMBINED. KEYSTONE HAS NOW OFFICIALLY SOAKED THE UNITED STATES IN MORE SPILLED OIL THAN ANY OTHER PIPELINE IN THE LAST DECADE. SINCE IT FIRST GOT UP AND RUNNING IN 2010 THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE SPILLED SO MUCH OIL THAT IF YOU SCOOPED UP ALL THE IT AND PUT IT IN ONE GALLON MILK JUG, THAT LINE OF MILK JUGS WOULD STRETCH FROM NEW YORK TO PHILADELPHIA AND BEYOND. THE COMPANY THAT RUNS THE PIPELINE SAYS WITH THIS NEW SPILL IN KANSAS, THEY SAY THEY ARE TOTALLY SURE THERE'S NO THREAT TO DRINKING WATER AT ALL. IT'S GOING TO BE FINE. AND THEY SAY THEY PUT OUT ALL THE STATE OF THE ART TECHNOLOGY TO STOP THE SPILL FROM SPREADING FURTHER DOWNSTREAM AND MAYBE EVEN SOMEDAY CLEAN IT UP. TO BE CLEAR, THE STATE OF THE ART WHEN IT COMES TO CLEANING UP OIL SPILLS IS PRETTY MUCH WHAT YOU INVENT IF YOU WERE PARTICULARLY UNIMAGINATIVE SECOND GRADER THINKING ABOUT THINGS. CLEANING UP OIL SPILLS STILL LOOKS LIKE IT DID IN THE '60s. LIKE SECTIONS OF BOOM, AND BIG PAPER TOWEL THINGIES AND SOMETIMES VACUUM TRUCKS TO TRY TO SLURP IT UP AND DUMP IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. LOBBYIST FOR OIL DRILLING AND FOR THINGS LIKE PIPELINES THAT SPILL OIL OVER KANSAS IS THE STATE OF THE ART IN THE OIL INDUSTRY THAT'S THE FERRARI. CLEANING UP THE SPILLS, THAT TECHNOLOGY IS STILL VERY MUCH THEIR MODEL T FORD. IT'S NOT LIKE THEY ARE PRIORITY FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS FIGURING OUT HOW TO CLEAN UP WHEN THEY SPILL. > THE COMPANY THAT OPERATES KEYSTONE SAYS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT CAUSED THIS LATEST BIGGEST SPILL. THEY SAY IT WAS A BIG SURPRISE TO THEM. WAS IT A SURPRISE TO EVERYONE? MORE AHEAD TONIGHT. STAY WITH US. EVERYONE? MORE AHEAD TONIGHT. STAY WITH US. > NOW AT&T INSTALLS THE NEST DOOR BILLION SO KNOW WHO'S AT FRONT DOOR.  LIKE MY NEW ART SUPPLIES.  AND YOU CAN SEE PACKAGES AND PEOPLE FROM HEAD TO TOE.  THANK YOU.

        "trs": "> IT'S 32 PAST THE HOUR, A LIVE LOOK AT THE WHITE HOUSE DRESSED UP FOR CHRISTMAS, YOU CAN BARELY SEE IT AS THE SUN HAS YET TO COME UP OVER WASHINGTON. TIME TO GET TO WORK, EVERYBODY. WE HAVE GREAT MUST READS THIS MORNING. THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" HAS A NEW OPINION PIECE ENTITLED \"WHY THE SMART PARTY NEVER LEARNS\", AND IT READS IN PART THIS, THE MOST OBVIOUS CHANGE IN AMERICAN POLITICS THIS CENTURY IS THE SORTS OF VOTERS ALONG EDUCATIONAL LINES. THE DEMOCRATS ARE INCREASINGLY THE PARTY OF EDUCATED URBAN ELITES. THE GOP BELONGS TO WHITE WORKING CLASS. IF YOU'RE ON THE RIGHT, YOU SIMPLY CAN'T ISOLATE YOURSELF FROM THE HABITS AND ATTITUDES OF LEFT LIBERAL PROGRESSIVISM. THEY ARE EVERYWHERE. THE CONSERVATIVE VOTERS WHO FOLLOWS NOTHING BUT RIGHT WING ACCOUNTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA STILL SEES CNN AS A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE AT AIRPORTS. HE ATTENDS A CONCERT BY THE LOCAL SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA AND HAS TO LISTEN TO A FOUR-MINUTE LECTURE ABOUT SYSTEMIC RACISM OR CLIMATE CHANGE BEFORE THE MUSIC STARTS. THERE IS NO BUBBLE. NO SILO FOR SUCH PERSON. THE LEFT LIBERAL OUTLOOK AS TRIUMPH ACROSS AMERICAN CULTURE, BUT THAT HAS ROBBED PROGRESSIVES TO CRITICISM THEMSELVES OR DOUBT THEIR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS. PROGRESSIVES HAVE BECOME, IF I COULD PUT IT BLUNTLY, INCURIOUS AND LAZY. WOW.  BY THE WAY, I'VE GOT TO SAY --  WHAT?  THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING OP-EDS I HAVE READ IN A LONG TIME.  INCURIOUS AND LAZY?  THIS IS A GUY TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE LIVING IN A BUBBLE WHO IS PERHAPS IN THE BIGGEST BUBBLE OF ALL. FIRST OF ALL, AS A SOUTHERN BAPTIST FROM THE DEEP SOUTH WHO WENT TO SOUTHERN STATE SCHOOLS, I CAN TELL YOU THE LEFT, I MEAN, IF YOU THINK THE LEFT OWNS THE MEDIA AND ACADEMIA AND HOLLYWOOD NOW, GROW UP WHEN I GREW UP WHEN YOU HAD THREE NEWS CHANNELS, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES,\" \"THE WASHINGTON POST.\" I MEAN, SERIOUSLY. AND I WENT TO SOUTHERN STATE SCHOOLS. I DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE CONSERVATIVE PROFESSOR. THIS WAS LIKE 30, 40 YEARS AGO. LIKE THINGS HAVE CHANGED AND ACTUALLY, THERE HAS BECOME MORE IDEOLOGICAL DIVERSITY NOW THAN EVER BEFORE. BUT, JEN, THIS IS WHAT ALMOST MADE MY HEAD EXPLODE. I'M READING THIS, AND YOU HAVE A GUY IN 2022 SAYING, OH, PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT, THEY CAN'T LIVE IN A BUBBLE LIKE PROGRESSIVES. AND YOU'RE RIGHT, A LOT OF PROGRESSIVES LIVE IN BUBBLES, AND THEY USUALLY LOSE ELECTIONS UNLESS THEY'RE FROM THE MOST WOKE PARTS OF BROOKLYN. PROGRESSIVES LIVE IN BUBBLES, WE'LL ALL ADMIT IT. IT DRIVES US CRAZY BUT TO SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT WING CAN'T LIVE IN BUBBLES, LIKE HE'S WRITING THIS AT THE AGE WHEN A LOT OF MY FRIENDS FROM EARLIER DAYS, A LOT OF MY CHURCH MEMBERS FROM EARLIER DAYS, A LOT OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS, STILL FAMILY MEMBERS, THEY COME AT ME WITH ELECTION DENYING NONSENSE. WE HEAR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT JEWISH LASERS SERIOUSLY. WE HEAR PEOPLE TALKING SERIOUSLY ABOUT SOME ITALIAN DUDE WITH A SATELLITE THAT STOLE ELECTIONS. WE HEAR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT BAMBOO AND BALLOTS IN ARIZONA. WE HEAR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT THAT SUITCASE LIE IN GEORGIA. WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT GET THEIR NEWS. A LOT OF THEM GET THEIR NEWS FROM CHINESE RELIGIOUS CULTS THAT RUN SITES IN AMERICA. WE HAVE PEOPLE, THEY GET THEIR NEWS FROM THE PLANDEMIC. ALL OF THESE ANTI-VAXX LIES THAT LIKE HIPPIES IN SAN FRANCISCO USED TO TALK ABOUT. NOW THEY'RE IN THESE EXTRAORDINARY BUBBLES. AND FOR SOMEBODY ON THE RIGHT TO SAY, OH, WE ON THE RIGHT, WE CAN'T LIVE IN BUBBLES, I HAVE NEVER SEEN PEOPLE LIVE IN A BUBBLE THE WAY PEOPLE ON THE FAR RIGHT, THE TRUMP RIGHT LIVE NOW. AND LET ME SAY IT AGAIN, FOR MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS LIVING ON THE FAR RIGHT, I'M TRYING TO DO YOU A FAVOR. YOU KEEP LOSING ELECTIONS WHEN YOU LIVE IN THAT BUBBLE. GET OUT OF THE BUBBLE. STOP FEARING PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY THINK DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU, AND LIKE ME, LEARN FROM THEM. JEN, I'M SORRY, THAT'S MY SPEECH FOR TODAY. THAT ANYBODY IN THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" COULD SAY, OH, THE RIGHT, THEY CAN'T LIVE IN A BUBBLE. ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS, THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES ARE BIZARRE AND THEY LIVE IN THIS BUBBLE THAT CAUSES THEM TO LOSE ELECTIONS YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT.  YES, I MEAN, IF YOU'RE WRITING WITH A $200 PEN ON LIKE LONG FORM AT \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" OP-ED, YOU MAY BE A LITTLE DISCONNECTED FROM WHERE THE COUNTRY LIVES. BUBBLES EXIST, TO YOUR POINT, JOE, ON ALL SIDES. IT'S NOT JUST ON THE RIGHT. THERE'S BUBBLES ON THE LEFT. WHAT IS VERY TRUE OF THE RIGHT, WHICH YOU WERE JUST TOUCHING ON IS THAT THERE IS THIS BELIEF THAT NOTHING WILL CHANGE IN THE COUNTRY, THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT EVOLVE, AND THAT IS JUST FLAT OUT WRONG. AND REPUBLICANS PURSUE THE SAME RIGHT WING POLICIES AT THEIR OWN DETRIMENT. LOOK, I WORKED FOR JOHN KERRY IN 2003 WHEN HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT. BACK THEN, WHICH WAS LESS THAN 20 YEARS AGO, WE HAD TO FIND A SLOW BIRD TO SHOOT TO PROVE THAT HE WAS FOR GUNS. YOU WOULD NEVER DO THAT IN DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RIGHT, TODAY, IT'S ALSO TRUE IN THAT SAME ELECTION, AND I BET YOU, JOE AND MIKA, YOU REMEMBER THIS, AND OTHER PEOPLE ON THE PANEL, THERE WERE ABOUT A DOZEN STATES WHERE GAY MARRIAGE WAS A DIVISIVE ISSUE HURTING DEMOCRATS ON BALLOTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE COUNTRY HAS EVOLVED, AND IF YOU ARE DISCONNECTED FROM THAT, ON THOSE ISSUES SPECIFICALLY, AND OTHERS, AND IF YOU'RE IN THIS RIGHT WING BUBBLE, YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE OUT OF WHACK WITH THE COUNTRY. WE SAW THAT PLAY OUT IN SUCH A WAY, WITH ELECTION DENIALISM. EVERYBODY IN THE BUBBLE ON THE RIGHT WING THOUGHT COULD NOT BE DEFEATED AND IT WAS A LITTLE OVER A MONTH AGO.  AT SOME POINT WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO LEARN ABOUT THE PROCESS ABOUT THE MEASURE OF THE SPEED OF A BIRD TO MAKE IT APPROPRIATE FOR JOHN KERRY TO SHOOT IT OUT OF THE SKY. THIS WILL REQUIRE A DEEP DIVE IN A LATER SNOW.  HOW DO YOU DO THAT, AND HOW MUCH PRACTICE DID IT TAKE?  BACK THEN IN 2004, EVERYBODY HAD A BARN JACKET ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, RIGHT, ONE OF THOSE LOOKING RURAL BARN JACKETS, EVEN IF THAT WASN'T ACTUALLY WHO THEY WERE, AND EVERYBODY WENT OUT AND SHOWED THEY COULD SHOOT A GUN. THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN A DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY TODAY.  CERTAINLY THAT HAS CHANGED. TO JEN'S POINT, THERE ARE BUBBLES ON THE LEFT AS WELL. IT SEEMS THIS IS A PARTICULARLY PERVASIVE PROBLEM, JOE, ON THE RIGHT. THIS IS THE REPUBLICANS NOW, IT IS GOING MORE EXTREME AND THE CIRCLE IS GETTING SMALLER. AND IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY'RE TALKING TO THEMSELVES OFTEN IN CODE, LIKE THE BIG GUY, PLANDEMIC, THINGS THAT MOST OF THE COUNTRY DOESN'T KNOW UNLESS YOU'RE AN EXTREMELY ONLINE PERSON ON THE RIGHT, SUBSCRIBE TO QANON OR WATCH CERTAIN FOX NEWS PRIME TIME EVENING OPINION HOSTS AND THEY BECOME MORE EXTREME AND OUT OF STEP WITH THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, ON ISSUES LIKE ABORTION. ON ISSUES LIKE GUNS. IT'S CERTAINLY ON ISSUES LIKE DEMOCRACY, AND THAT'S WHERE THE DEMOCRATS AND THE WHITE HOUSE IN PARTICULAR HAVE ZEROED IN ON, TRYING TO PAINT THEM AS OUT OF STEP, AND THAT'S GOING TO BE THE PLAY BOOK GOING FORWARD, AS THE CALENDAR TURNS TO JANUARY AND REPUBLICANS HAVE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT, HOW EXTREME AND OUT OF TOUCH AND INSULAR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BECOME, AND A SLOW MOVING SELF-DESTRUCTION OF THE GOP.  LET'S COMPARE WHAT THIS INCOMING REPUBLICAN HOUSE IS TALKING ABOUT.  OH, MY GOD.  AND WHAT OUR REPUBLICAN HOUSE IN 1994 WAS TALKING ABOUT.  CAN'T SAY SOME OF IT ON THE AIR, ACTUALLY.  YOU LOOK NOW, AND THEY'RE TALKING OF COURSE ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP. THEY'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS TWITTER THING THAT I SWEAR I'VE TRIED TO READ THROUGH A THOUSAND TIMES AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PROVE, AND IF THEY'RE PROVING ANYTHING, WHAT, MAYBE THAT TWITTER MADE DECISIONS THAT THEY DIDN'T LIKE. WELL, FACEBOOK DOES THE SAME THING. AGAIN, WHETHER THEY'RE RIGHT, THE OBSESSION WITH HUNTER BIDE BIDEN'S LAPTOP, BEING ANGRY AN AMERICAN GOT RELEASED. AND MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE GIVING A SPEECH THIS PAST WEEKEND, IF SHE HAD RUN THE JANUARY 6th REVOLUTION, THEY WOULD HAVE WON, AND HER EXACT QUOTE, I WANT TO GET IT RIGHT, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ARMED. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ARMED. NOW, THEY THINK THAT'S COOL. AND HERE'S THE THING, MY DEAR SWEET REPUBLICAN BROTHERS AND SISTERS, YOU THINK YOU'RE OWNING THE LIBS WHEN YOU SAY THAT. AND MAYBE, YES, THERE WILL BE PEOPLE ON MSNBC THAT WILL SCREAM AND YELL AND YOU'LL GET THEIR HEADS TO SPIN. THAT'S FINE. THEY'LL BE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR. THE CHOIR WILL LIKE IT. FOX NEWS PREACHES TO THE CHOIR. THE CHOIR LIKES IT. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SWING VOTERS THAT MADE YOU LOSE IN 2017 AND 2018 AND 2019, AND 2020 AND MADE YOU LOSE AGAIN IN 2022 AND RADICALLY UNDERPERFORM BY 40 OR 50 SEATS IN 2022 IN THE HOUSE. AND RICHARD, YOU COMPARE THAT TO '94. YEAH, GINGRICH OBVIOUSLY A VERY COMPLEX CHARACTER, LET US SAY, BUT IN '94, WE CAME IN, PEOPLE SAID, WHAT ARE YOU RUNNING FOR. RUNNING FOR BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT, RUNNING REGULATORY REFORM, RUNNING TO BRING DOWN THE COSTS OF HEALTH CARE. HE HAVE TEN THINGS WE ARE GOING TO LIMIT, TERM LIMITS, WE WERE FOR TERM LIMITING COMMITTEE CHAIR PEOPLE. WE WERE FOR TERM LIMITING THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. WE WERE FOR MAKING THE LOSS OF WASHINGTON APPLY TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. I COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON. HERE I AM 30 YEARS LATER. I CAN STILL REMEMBER THE TEN THINGS, WHAT ARE YOU FOR, AND EVERY ONE OF THEM WAS AN ISSUE THAT AMERICANS SAID, THAT SOUNDS GOOD. AND THESE CLOWNS ARE RUNNING AROUND TALKING ABOUT BRINGING GUNS TO JANUARY THE 6th. OBSESSING OVER TWITTER. HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP, AND JUST THE CRAZIEST OF THINGS THAT DON'T RELATE TO QUALITY OF LIFE, THAT DON'T RELATE TO MAKING OUR STREETS SAFER. THAT DON'T RELATE TO INFLATION.  THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. THE ONLY THING YOU LEFT OFF THE LIST. THEY'RE ALSO GOING AFTER TONY FAUCI WHO'S STEPPING DOWN AFTER A LONG DISTINGUISHED CAREER OF PUBLIC SERVICE. THAT'S WHAT'S SO ODD ABOUT THIS. YOU JUST HAD THE MIDTERMS AND YOU HAVE A SET OF ISSUES, THE BORDER ISSUE, INFLATION AND THE ECONOMY, THE FACT THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE NEVER COME BACK TO WORK, CRIME IN THE CITIES. IF THERE WAS A MOMENT REPUBLICANS COULD RUN ON THE ISSUES, YOU WOULD THINK THIS IS IT, INSTEAD THEY'RE DEALING WITH HOT HOUSE ISSUES. WHAT WORRIES ME ABOUT THIS MOMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY IS YOU HAVE RESPECTIVE SETS OF BUBBLES. HERE IN NEW YORK, YOU'VE GOT ONE PARTY GOVERNMENT IN NEW YORK CITY. AND WHAT WORRIES ME IS THIS IS A COUNTRY, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, WAS FOUNDED ON AN IDEA. THE IDEA IS CERTAINLY THINGS THAT WERE HELD IN COMMON. NOW EVERYBODY HAS THEIR OWN MEDIA ECOSYSTEM, THEIR OWN SOCIAL MEDIA ECOSYSTEM, THEY LIVE IN COMMUNITIES AND GO TO CHURCHES THAT TEND TO BE ONE DIMENSIONAL, THEY WATCH FOX. PEOPLE WE NO LONGER HAVE THE SOCIAL MOBILITY WE DID. I DO WORRY THERE'S A SEPARATENESS IN THE POLITICAL SCIENCE LITERATURE, SORTING, THAT INCREASINGLY WE'RE LEADING SEPARATE LIVES IN AMERICA, AND I ACTUALLY THINK THAT'S REALLY DANGER FOR THE FABRIC OF THIS SOCIETY. IT'S ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS FOR THINGS LIKE NATIONAL SERVICE AND SO FORTH. WE NEED SOME WAYS TO GET AMERICANS OUT OF THEIR SEPARATENESS AND TO GIVE THEM SOME COMMON EXPERIENCES. IF NOT, WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DRIFT APART. I THINK THAT'S REALLY UNHEALTHY FOR THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY AND FOR OUR ABILITY TO GOVERN AND LIVE TOGETHER.  GREAT POINT.  IT IS A GREAT POINT. AND AGAIN, WHAT WE HAVE ALL SAID HERE IS THERE ARE BUBBLES ON BOTH SIDES, BUBBLES ON THE LEFT. THERE'S BUBBLES ON THE RIGHT. BUT WHEN YOU OBSESS, WHEN YOUR LEADERS ARE INSIDE THAT BUBBLE, YOU LOSE ELECTIONS. THE TRUMP BUBBLE HAS COST REPUBLICANS TIME AND TIME AGAIN. IN 2012, REPUBLICANS WERE IN A BUBBLE AS WELL. MITT ROMNEY, EVERYBODY ON THE CAMPAIGN, THEY WATCHED FOX NEWS ALL DAY. THEY LOOKED AT GALLOP POLLS. THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE AHEAD OF BARACK OBAMA BY ELEVEN POINTS. THEY READ DRUDGE. THEY WERE CERTAIN LATE INTO THE EVENING THEY WERE GOING TO WIN. I REMEMBER KARL ROVE SAYING THOSE NUMBERS CAN'T BE RIGHT BECAUSE EVEN KARL ROVE WAS INSIDE A BUBBLE, AN INFORMATION BUBBLE. HE'S NOT IN THAT BUBBLE NOW, BUT WE CAN GET IN OUR BUBBLE IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, BUT RIGHT NOW, IT'S THE RIGHT THAT'S LOSING ELECTION AFTER ELECTION AFTER ELECTION.  WHY CAN'T THEY SEE THAT? WHAT ARE THEY SAYING INSIDE THEIR BUBBLE ABOUT THEIR ELECTIONS?  JEN, I SOMETIMES WONDER, AND I'M SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. I SOMETIMES WONDER WHETHER THEY WOULD LIKE TO THINK THEY'RE OWNING THE LIBS MORE THAN WINNING ELECTIONS. LIKE I'VE SAID IT BEFORE ON THIS SHOW, LIKE, MY PARENTS TAUGHT ME, LIKE, TO WIN. THERE WAS NO LOSING. I REMEMBER ONE TIME I HAD LIKE A 450 AVERAGE IN SENIOR LEAGUES.  THEY WERE A LITTLE HARD ON YOU.  I STRUCK OUT WITH BASES LOADED TO END A GAME. I THREW THE BAT DOWN. I WENT TO THE CAR, I SAT IN THE BACKSEAT, AND I SAID, I'M JUST GOING TO QUIT. MY MOTHER DRIVING OFF COOLLY AND CALMLY SAYS, WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO EMBARRASS YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY THAT WAY, I WISH YOU WOULD. RIGHT? THIS IS THE SAME FAMILY THAT GOT ANGRY WHEN I ONLY GOT 73% OF THE VOTE IN MY FIRST REELECTION VOTE. LIKE THERE WERE NO PARTICIPATION TROPHIES, BUT THAT'S WHAT I USED TO SAY REPUBLICANS ARE LIKE. IT WAS ABOUT WINNING. RIGHT?  MAYBE THEY WANT TO BE A CONSTANT UNDERDOG.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE MORE INTERESTED IN BEING VICTIMS THAN WINNERS. WE'RE SEEING IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN, JEN, AND I'M SERIOUS, IT'S BAFFLING TO ME.  YEAH, FIRST OF ALL THAT TOUGH LOVE PARENTING AS THE PARENT OF A 4 AND 7-YEAR-OLD, IS NO MORE, JOE. BEYOND THAT, NOW, WE JUST LIKE LOVE ON THEM AND ASK THEM WHAT THEY WANT TO DO TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL BETTER ABOUT THEIR BASEBALL GAME.  EXACTLY.  ONE OF THE DEVELOPMENTS, OF COURSE, HAS BEEN THE RISE OF TWITTER, SOCIAL MEDIA, AS A FORCE FOR HOW PEOPLE ALSO RAISE MONEY. RIGHT? SO THE EXTREMISM, EXTREME COMMENTS, CRAZY THINGS PEOPLE ARE SAYING ON THE RIGHT HAS BEEN INCENTIVIZED, BECAUSE THEY GET MORE LIKES, THEY GET MORE FOLLOWERS. THEY CAN SEND OUT OUTRAGEOUS FUNDRAISING E-MAILS TO RAISE MORE MONEY. AND THEY HAVE DECIDED A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS, NOT ALL, FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND SOME IN A DIFFERENT WAY, LESS EVIL ON THE LEFT IS THAT IS THE WAY TO EFFECTIVELY RUN CAMPAIGNS. BUT WHAT WE HAVE SEEN THAT HAS DISPUTED THAT, OF COURSE, IS HOW A NUMBER OF CANDIDATES RAN SUCCESSFULLY. LOOK AT RAPHAEL WARNOCK WHO JUST WON LAST WEEK. HE WAS NOT THINKING ABOUT HOW TO BE EXTREME ONLINE AND RAISE MONEY THAT WAY. HE WENT OUT, HE WENT TO EVERY PART OF THE STATE, INCLUDING RED COUNTIES WHERE HE HAD NO PROBABLY BUSINESS OF GOING, WHERE THERE WERE HARDLY ANY DEMOCRATS, HE CAMPAIGNED HIS HEART OUT, KEPT HIS HEAD DOWN, TALKED ABOUT THE ISSUES, AND HE WON. THE MODEL CAN BE THAT. I THINK MORE DEMOCRATS HOPEFULLY SAW THAT AS A MODEL. ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, TO YOUR POINT, THEY ARE RUNNING TO SATISFY TWITTER. TO SATISFY THE EXTREME, TO SEND OUT FUNDRAISING E-MAILS TO THEIR DETRIMENT.  JEN PSAKI, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THIS MORNING. > THE ARTEMIS MOON MISSION ENDS WITH A SPLASH DOWN. NASA ADMINISTRATOR BILL NELSON WILL JOIN US WITH WHAT'S NEXT FOR SPACE EXPLORATION. > AND THE MIAMI DOLPHINS GET A ROUGHING THE PASSER PENALTY.  DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CALL THAT, IT'S A TACKLE.

        "trs": "> TEN MINUTES BEFORE THE TOP OF THE HOUR. JUST DAYS NOW AFTER HERSCHEL WALKER'S SENATE RUNOFF LOSS IN GEORGIA, WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE INNER WORKINGS OF HIS FAILED CAMPAIGN, A TEXT MESSAGE SENT TO WALKER'S ADULT SON CHRISTIAN, PLEADING FOR HIS HELP. IN THIS TEXT FROM OVER THE SUMMER, SHARED TO NBC NEWS A CAMPAIGN STAFFER ASKED THE SON TO HELP GUIDE HIS FATHER IN HIS MESSAGING. WE KNOW HOW THAT ENDED. JOINING US NOW, SENIOR NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER MARC CAPUTO. READING YOUR PIECE, IT SEEMS IT WAS JUST AS MESSY ON THE INSIDE.  THE PROBLEM THAT THE CAMPAIGN HAD, AND THIS IS ACCORDING TO MULTIPLE INTERVIEWS WITH STAFFERS OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, HERSCHEL WALKER DIDN'T TELL THEM THE TRUTH. HE INHIBITED THEM FROM LEARNING THE TRUTH. ONE OF THE THINGS YOU WANT TO DO AS A CAMPAIGN IS VET YOUR CANDIDATE AND UNDERSTAND HIS OR HER OR THEIR WEAKNESSES. USUALLY YOU DO AN OPPOSITION RESEARCH BOOK ON YOUR OWN CANDIDATE SO YOU CAN SAY, OKAY, THIS IS GOING TO BE A HIT ON US, AND HERE'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH IT. THAT WAS DONE TWICE WITH HERSCHEL WALKER, ONCE BEFORE HE RAN. APPARENTLY THIS 500 PAGE BOOK LANDED WITH A THUD ON HIS DESK, AND THEY'RE LIKE, LOOK, YOU GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS. WE DISCOVERED 500 PAGES OF BAD STUFF ON YOU IN TWO WEEKS. HE DECIDED TO PRESS AHEAD ANYWAY. THEN IN THE WINTER, HE ANNOUNCED IN AUGUST OF 2021, THE CAMPAIGN REALIZED, YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO CONTROL OUR CANDIDATE A LITTLE BETTER. AT 4:00 A.M., HE KEPT POSTING THESE WEIRD STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS TWITTER VIDEOS WHERE HE WAS GIVING THESE MEDITATIONS, AND THEY REACHED OUT TO CHRISTIAN WALKER, CAN YOU GET HIM TO STOP THIS, AND CHRISTIAN WALKER DID. FAST FORWARD TO JUNE OF 2022, AND BY THEN, THERE ARE REPORTS, AND REPORTERS SNIFFING AROUND ABOUT SECRET LOVE CHILDREN AND POSSIBLE ABORTIONS THAT HE PAID FOR OR ASKED PEOPLE TO HAVE. HERSCHEL WALKER BEING AN ANTIABORTION CANDIDATE, AND THE CANDIDATE WAS HAVING TROUBLE GETTING THROUGH TO HERSCHEL WALKER, GETTING HIM TO STAY ON MESSAGE. A STAFFER REACHED OUT TO CHRISTIAN WALKER, CAN YOU HELP US WITH YOUR DAD. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? THEY SAID, LOOK TELL HIM TO STOP BEING A MORON ON TELEVISION. THAT'S A DIRECT QUOTE, READ THE PLAYBOOK, ET CETERA. IT'S AN INSIGHT INTO A CAMPAIGN WHO HAD TROUBLE MANAGING A CELEBRITY CANDIDATE WHO HAD NO FACE WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO FACE, AND DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THEIR PROFESSIONAL OPINIONS WHEN IT CAME TO MANAGING HIM.  THIS IS A TEAM OF PROFESSIONAL POLITICAL HANDS WHO KNEW HOW BAD WALKER WAS RIGHT FROM THE OUT SET. THEY COME BACK IN TWO WEEKS WITH 500 PAGES OF STUFF ON HERSCHEL WALKER.  RIGHT. USUALLY THAT'S A RED FLAG. THEN BY THE WINTER OF 2021 INTO 2022, WHEN THEY REALIZED THAT THE CANDIDATE, HERSCHEL WALKER HAD NOT BEEN STRAIGHT WITH THEM. THEY DID ANOTHER OPPOSITION RESEARCH BOOK ON THEIR OWN CANDIDATE AND FOUND MORE STUFF. IN THE END, THEY STILL DIDN'T FIND THAT STORY OF A FORMER GIRLFRIEND, THE MOTHER OF ONE OF HIS FOUR KIDS, WHO CLAIMED THAT AT ONE POINT, HE PRESSURED HER AND PAID FOR HER ABORTION. BUT THAT WAS ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BE DISCOVERED UNLESS YOU DID A DEEPER DIVE. THE PROBLEM, ACCORDING TO THE CAMPAIGN STAFF IS WALKER DIDN'T ALLOW THEM TO TALK TO THE WOMEN WHO WERE THE MOTHERS OF HIS CHILDREN. HE HAD FOUR CHILDREN BY FOUR DIFFERENT WOMEN, AND FOR CANDIDATES, HAVING FORMER GIRLFRIENDS, FORMER WIVES, PEOPLE YOU USED TO LIVE WITH, THAT COULD BE A VULNERABILITY, AND THE CAMPAIGN NEEDS TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE, FIND OUT IF THEY'RE ON BOARD. SINCE THEY WERE UNABLE TO REACH THESE PEOPLE, AND UNABLE TO TALK TO THEM, GUESS WHAT HAPPENED, HE KIND OF GOT AMBUSHED.  SO, MARC, YOU'RE LOOKING AT A NEW POLL OUT OF FLORIDA. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK OF DONALD TRUMP'S ABSOLUTELY DISASTROUS CAMPAIGN LAUNCH, AND IT MAY BE HAVING AN IMPACT IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. TELL US ABOUT IT.  IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE POLLS BY WAGNER RESEARCH, WHICH IS A REPUBLICAN POLLING FIRM, 500 REPUBLICANS POLLED, RON DeSANTIS IS OFF THE CHARTS AT LEAST AMONG REPUBLICANS IN HIS APPROVAL RATING. 79%, NEARLY EIGHT IN TEN PEOPLE HAVE A VERY FAVORABLE IMPRESSION OF HIM IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. DONALD TRUMP'S NUMBERS, 44%. THE TOP LINE NUMBER FOR RON DeSANTIS IS ALSO FAR HIGHER THAN THE TOP LINE NUMBER FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP OR FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. SO AT LEAST IN FLORIDA, THE HOME STATE OF BOTH DeSANTIS AND TRUMP, REPUBLICAN VOTERS ARE INCREASINGLY AND VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHOM THEY PREFER IN THE PARTY, AND IT'S RON DeSANTIS. IT'S NOT DONALD TRUMP. NOW, DeSANTIS, IS HE GOING TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, IS HE NOT, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT IN A NUMBER OF MONTHS.  MARC, IT'S JONATHAN, A LOT OF REPUBLICANS HAVE A LOT INVESTED IN GOVERNOR RON DeSANTIS RIGHT NOW. SOME ACKNOWLEDGE, HE'S KIND OF A BLANK CANVAS. THEY CAN PROJECT WHAT THEY WANT ON HIM. THE COUNTRY DOESN'T KNOW HIM YET. OUTSIDE OF HIS STUNT WITH THE MIGRANTS WITH MARTHA'S VINEYARD, WHICH MADE HIM A NATIONAL FIGURE. WHAT'S THE LATEST FOR PEOPLE AROUND HIM? I'M SURE A DECLARATION OF A CAMPAIGN IS A WAYS OFF. IS THERE MORE OF AN EFFORT TO GIVE HIM A NATIONAL PROFILE TO LET VOTERS LEARN WHO HE IS.  THEY'RE NOT SHARING THAT WITH US. IF WE REVERSE OR REWIND, HOW HE BECAME A NATIONAL FIGURE OT -- OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE FIRST HIGH PROFILE GOVERNOR TO FLING HIS STATE OPEN, AND DEPENDING ON WHO YOU TALK TO, HE WAS MORE RIGHT THAN HIS CRITICS. THAT SORT OF MADE HIM THIS BIG FIGURE IN THE GOP. THEN YOU MOVE TO THE LAST LEGISLATIVE SESSION. THERE WAS THE PARENTS' RIGHTS BILL WHICH HAS BEEN DUBBED THE DON'T SAY GAY BILL. THAT GAVE HIM A NATIONAL PLATFORM. HIS ANTIWOKE ACT, WHICH IS HIS PHRASE OR STOP WOKE, THAT ALSO DID. SO HE'S REPEATEDLY BEEN ABLE TO USE STORIES AND LEGISLATION IN FLORIDA TO KIND OF PROPEL HIMSELF FORWARD, AND THEN THAT ULTIMATE STUNT WITH THE MIGRANTS IN VENEZUELA. WE HAVE AN UPCOMING LEGISLATIVE SESSION ABOUT PROPERTY INSURANCE, I IMAGINE HE'S GOING TO DECIMATE THE TRIAL LAWYERS. THE REGULAR SESSION IS GOING TO BE IN MARCH. ENOUGH LEGISLATION THERE TO POSSIBLY USE TO CAPTURE NATIONAL ATTENTION. HE'S GOT A BOOK COMING OUT IN FEB. FEBRUARY. IF YOU ADD THOSE THINGS UP, WHAT ELSE CAN HE DO. THIS COMING SUNDAY, HE HAS NATIONAL DONORS COMING INTO MIAMI FOR ALLEGEDLY A THANK YOU DINNER. WHILE PEOPLE AREN'T BEING ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE, HE'S STILL INTERESTED IN POSSIBLY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. I COULD IMAGINE SEEING HIM TRAVEL TO AN EARLY STATE JUST AS SORT OF A HELLO, SHOWING A LITTLE BIT OF LEG, BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO KNOW ANYTHING VERY CLEARLY ABOUT HIS INTENTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION SOMETIME AFTER THE SUMMER, YOU KNOW, MAYBE MEMORIAL DAY, LABOR DAY, STUFF LIKE THAT. BUT UNLIKE A LOT OF THE ALSO POSSIBLE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT, RON DeSANTIS HAS TWO LUXURIES, HE'S GOT TIME AND MONEY. HE'S GOT ABOUT $64 MILLION IN THE BANK HE CAN CONVERT TO A SUPER PAC. THAT GOES A LONG WAY.  IT REALLY DOES. I'M SORRY, WILLIE, GO AHEAD.  I WAS GOING TO SAY, MARK, DID HE HAVE, AT THIS POINT, DID HE WATCH DONALD TRUMP WITH ALL OF THESE SELF-INFLICTED WOUNDS TO GET WEAKER BY THE DAY. DOES RON DeSANTIS HAVE THE GUTS TO RUN AGAINST DONALD TRUMP. REMEMBER, HE RAN THOSE ADS WITH LITTLE KIDS WITH MAGA ONESIES USING THEIR BUILDING BLOCKS TO BUILD A WALL. IT WAS ALL LINKED TO DONALD TRUMP. IS HE REALLY GOING TO STEP OUT AND CROSS DONALD TRUMP AND RUN FOR PRESIDENT?  I HAVE ALWAYS HELD THAT RON DeSANTIS IS NOT GOING TO RUN AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP UNLESS THE POLLING CHANGES. WELL, THE POLLING HAS CHANGED. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU NOTICE IF YOU OBSERVE DeSANTIS. HE'S CALCULATING, HE'S CAUTIOUS. HE'S DATA DRIVEN, AND HE'S DISCIPLINED. AND SO IF THE TREND CONTINUES AND IF THERE'S REALLY A SPACE FOR HIM TO TAKE ON TRUMP AND WIN, YEAH, I THINK HE'LL PROBABLY DO IT. THOSE ARE TWO BIG IFS, AND THERE'S GOT TO BE A LOT MORE TIME TO ELAPSE. A LOT MORE POLLING AND TO YOUR POINT, YOUR ORIGINAL POINT ASKING THE QUESTION, THERE'S THIS TIME, THIS PERIOD OF TIME FOR HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF MORE OF A NATIONAL FIGURE, HOW DOES RON DeSANTIS DO THAT. HOW DOES HE END|20221209115955|2022-12-09_1100_US_MSNBC_Morning_Joe ",

        "trs": "\u266a \u266a \u266a ON THIS VOTE, THE YAYS ARE 258, THE NAYS ARE ONE AND 69. PRESENT ONE. THE MOTION IS ADOPTED! IT WAS A MOMENT OUR NEXT GUEST SAYS HE NEVER IMAGINED HIS WILDEST DREAMS. THAT'S TODAY PASSED LEGISLATION TO ENSHRINE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS FOR MARRIAGES, SAME-SEX COUPLES, AND INTERRACIAL MARRIAGES. A VERSION OF THE BILL WAS APPROVED IN THE SENATE LATE LAST MONTH. THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT IS NOW HEADED TO THE PRESIDENTS DESK. IT IS A HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT, ONE THAT ONLY A DECADE AGO, JUST A DECADE AGO, WAS CONSIDERED UNTHINKABLE BY BOTH PARTIES. NEW YORK CONGRESSMAN RICHIE TORRES JOINS ME NOW, HE PRESIDED OVER TODAY'S HOUSE DEBATE. CONGRESSMAN, I CAUGHT YOU WATCHING THE SOUND FROM SPEAKER PELOSI. HUGE GRIN ON YOUR FACE. I AM SURE THIS IS MEANINGFUL TO YOU. NOT JUST AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS, BUT ALSO PERSONALLY. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN TO YOU?  IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST EMPOWERING MOMENTS OF MY LIFE, I GREW UP IN THE PROJECTS, THE BRONX, FEAR OF COMING OUT. I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BECOME A MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND HOPING TO PRESIDE OVER THE DEBATE FOR THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT. FOR ME, THERE IS NOTHING MORE GRATIFYING THAN AFFIRMING YOUR ONLY QUALITY ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. SO IT WAS AN EMPOWERING MOMENT. WE MADE HISTORY. AND I COULDN'T BE HAPPIER  THE CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT, YOU AND I ARE ABOUT THE SAME AGE. AND THIS TRULY WAS UNTHINKABLE. IN RECENT MEMORY. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU HAVE 169 REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED AGAINST MARRIAGE EQUALITY, SEVERAL TOOK TO THE FLOOR TO EXPLAIN WHY, TAKE A LISTEN.  GOD'S PERFECT DESIGN IS INDEED MARRIAGE BETWEEN ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN FOR LIFE. AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU THINK OR WHAT I THINK, THAT IS WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS.  I HOPE AND PRAY THAT MY COLLEAGUES WILL FIND THE COURAGE TO JOIN ME IN OPPOSING THIS MISGUIDED AND THIS DANGEROUS BILL.  I DON'T TAKE THE DEVOTION TO PLAY THAT SOUND LIGHTLY. BUT I PLAY BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE COUNTER FORCE HERE. YOU HAVE TO STAND THERE AND LISTEN TO THOSE ARGUMENTS. WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE?  WELL AS I WAS PRESIDING, I HAD TO REMIND MY REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES THAT THEIR TIME HAD ASPIRED, WHICH TO ME HAS A DEEPER MEANING.  DOUBLE ENTENDRE, FOR SURE.  I SAID DURING MY SPEECH, WE'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE IT TO THE FORCE OF HATE AND THE RELICS OF THE PAST TO BE THE FINAL WORD ON THE FATE OF LOVE THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY DOES NOT BELONG TO BIGOTRY. IT BELONGS TO LGBTQ INCLUSIVE DEMOCRACY. AND THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT IS LIVING PROOF. THE FACT THAT IT DID PASS ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS IN BOTH THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE IS A SIGN OF HOW FAR WE HAVE COME AS A SOCIETY. AND THE REPUBLICANS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR AND OPPOSITION ARE RELICS OF THE PAST.  HOW FAR WE HAVE COME, AND OF COURSE, I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU HOW MUCH MORE WORK THERE IS STILL TO BE DONE. LGBTQ ADVOCATES OF COURSE WORRY THIS MEASURE DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH TO PROTECT MARRIAGE. TO PROTECT OTHER FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. YOUR SENSE OF WHAT MORE CONGRESS CAN DO?  WELL THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT WAS THE BEST BILL THAT WE COULD PASS TO SURVIVE THE FILIBUSTER IN THE SENATE. BUT IT IS MONUMENTAL ON ITS OWN TERMS. I MEAN, I, IT REPEALS THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT WHICH TO ME IS ONE OF THE MOST DISCRIMINATORY PIECES OF LEGISLATION CONGRESS HAS EVER ENACTED. SECOND, EIGHT FEDERALLY RECOGNIZES SAME SEX MARRIAGE. THERE ARE MORE THAN 1000 LOSS PROVIDING BENEFITS, RIGHTS, AND LOST TO MARRIED COUPLES. UNDER THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACTS, SAME SEX COUPLES WOULD HAVE ACCESS EQUAL ACCESS TO THOSE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES FOR THE FIRST TIME UNDER FEDERAL LAW. KEEP IN MIND, THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT DID NOT RISE IN A VACUUM. THEY CAME IN RESPONSE TO THE TRADITIONAL ACTIVISM OF THE SUPREME COURT. WE ARE DOING THAT FOR THE RIGHTS AND MARRIAGE, WHAT WE SHOULD'VE DONE FOR THE RIGHT TO AN ABORTION. WE AREN'T RUNNING INTO FEDERAL LAW IN ORDER TO PROTECT IT FROM THE RADICALISM OF THE SUPREME COURT  YET, I AM SURE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE?  WELL, FOR ME, THE HOLY GRAIL OF LGBTQ EQUALITY IS THE EQUALITY ACT. WHICH WILL PROTECT THE EQUALITY -- LGBTQ COMMUNITY FROM DISCRIMINATION AREAS BEYOND MARRIAGE AND HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT, AND PUBLIC ACCOMMODATION. SO FOR ME THAT SHOULD BE THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THE LGBTQ CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.  IT IS NOT LOST ON ME, I AM SURE IT IS NOT LOST ON YOU. THE MOMENT IN WHICH THIS IS ALL HAPPENING, RIGHT? YOU HAVE HAD AGAINST THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY ON THE RISE. I UNDERSTAND THAT IN SOME REGARDS THAT CANNOT BE LEGISLATED. THAT IS CULTURAL. THAT IS SOCIAL. I DO WONDER WHAT YOU BELIEVE LAWMAKERS CAN DO, WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE IN THIS NEXT CONGRESS. I KNOW WHAT YOUR HOLY GRAIL IS. I THINK YOU AND I KNOW THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT IS GONNA BE POSSIBLE IN THE NEXT YEARS. WHAT IS POSSIBLE, TO PROTECT LGBTQ AMERICANS FROM THIS GROWING THREAT? AND AS IT HAPPEN IN CONGRESS OR DOES IT HAPPEN IN STATE HOUSES?  THE FIGHT FOR EQUALITY IS WAGED EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL. YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH WE HAD PAST THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS, THE TRUTH, IS THERE MOST OF THE PARTY HAS NEVER BEEN RADICALIZED AGAINST THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. WE'VE SEEN THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAGE A VICIOUS CAMPAIGN OF SCRAPBOOKING AND FEARMONGERING. PARTICULARLY AGAINST THE TRANSPARENCY. WE HAVE SEEN SO MANY BILLS, THEY DON'T SAY GAY LAW. I BELIEVE THE WORDS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS SET OFF A WAVE OF HATE LINE -- AGAINST THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. WORDS OF CONSEQUENCES, AND THOSE OF US AND ELECTED OFFICE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SPEAK UP FORCEFULLY AGAINST ANTI LGBTQ BIGOTRY COMING FROM THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT. COMING FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY  CONGRESSMAN RICHIE TORRES, THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO JOIN US ON WHAT I KNOW WAS A VERY BUSY AND IMPORTANT TODAY. COMING, UP WE'RE GONNA BREAK DOWN THE POLITICS SURROUNDING THIS VERY BUSY NEWS DAY WITH OUR FAVORITE POLITICAL INSIDERS, WHEN THE 11TH HOUR CONTINUES.

        "trs": "> ON THIS VOTE, 258-169. PRESENT ONE. THE MOTION IS ADOPTED.  SPEAKER PELOSI GAVELING IN THE VOTE TO PASS THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT. IT ENSHRINES FEDERAL PROTECTIONS FOR MARRIAGES OF SAME-SEX AND INTERRACIAL COUPLES. 39 REPUBLICANS JOINED DEMOCRATS TO PASS THE BILL, WHICH PASSED THE SENATE LAST WEEK AND NOW HEADS TO PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN'S DESK TO SIGN. THE BILL ORIGINATED IN THE WAKE OF THE DOBBS DECISION AND FEARS THAT A 6-3 CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY SUPREME COURT WOULD BE WILLING TO REVERSE ITS PREVIOUS DECISION ON SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. LET'S BRING IN \"WASHINGTON POST\" ASSOCIATE EDITOR AND HOST OF MSNBC'S \"THE SUNDAY SHOW,\" JONATHAN CAPEHEART. THEY WEREN'T JUST FEARS. JIM JORDAN IS SAYING THIS IS SOME FEAR THAT DOESN'T EXIST. THIS IS WHAT THOMAS SAID HE WOULD LOOK AT. THIS WAS IN WRITING. THIS ISN'T SOME ABSTRACT CONCERN ABOUT MARRIAGE EQUALITY. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THOMAS HAS ALLUDED TO HAVING IN HIS SIGHTS.  RIGHT. THE FIRST RED FLAG IN ALL OF THIS CAME WHEN THE ALITO DRAFT WAS LEAKED EARLIER THIS YEAR. IN READING THAT DRAFT, I CAME IMMEDIATELY TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IF YOU CAN MAKE THESE ARGUMENTS FOR OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE, THEN THE SAME ARGUMENTS COULD BE USED TO OVERTURN THE SUPREME COURT RULING THAT LEGALIZED SAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND THEN LO AND BEHOLD, THE DOBBS DECISION COMES OUT IN JUNE, OVERTURNED ROE. JUSTICE THOMAS SIGNS ON TO THE MAJORITY OPINION AND THEN IN HIS CONCURRING OPINION SAYS, BY THE WAY, WE SHOULD LOOK AT SEVERAL OF THESE SUPREME COURT PRECEDENTS THAT RELIED ON THE RATIONALE FOR ROE, AMONG THOSE BEING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. THAT'S WHY THERE WAS SO MUCH CONSTERNATION AND FEAR THAT AS A RESULT OF OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE AND A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SAYING WE SHOULD LOOK AT, REVIEW, RECONSIDER AND ON TOP OF THAT A JUSTICE WHO IS PART OF A 6-3 CONSERVATIVE SUPER MAJORITY ON THE COURT, THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE, THANK GOODNESS, IN CONGRESS WHO SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE NEED TO CODIFY SAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE. AS SOMEONE IN BOTH, I AM VERY HAPPY THAT CONGRESS MOVED TO LEGALIZE AS A MATTER OF FEDERAL LAW, NOT JUST SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT, SAME-SEX MARRIAGE AND INTERRACIAL MARRIAGES AS A RESULT OF THE VOTE TODAY.  DO YOU WORRY THERE'S THIS RELATIVELY, THAT ON THE RIGHT IT'S SO EXTREME AND IT WAS DESIRED TO BE BIPARTISANBIPARTI?  UPWARDS OF 70% OF AMERICANS BELIEVE IT SHOULD REMAIN THE LAW OF THE LAND. UPWARD OF 67% OF ALL AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT ABORTION SHOULD BE LEGAL. HOW MUCH OF THIS IS THAT -- THIS IS WHAT WAS ACHIEVABLE, SO THE LAWS OF RELATIVITY REQUIRE US TO SAY THIS WAS BETTER THAN NOTHING. WHERE DOES THAT -- WHAT ARE WE ON THE PATH TOWARD?  HOPEFULLY, IT MEANS WE'RE ON THE CONTINUAL JOURNEY FORWARD. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT, YES, THIS IS A SMALL STEP IN THE MARCH FORWARD. BUT THAT'S AMERICAN HISTORY.  YEAH.  THAT IS THE STORY OF CIVIL RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY. WE DIDN'T GET TO THE 1965 VOTING RIGHTS ACT OR THE 1964 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE. THOSE MOVEMENTS STARTED REALLY GALVANIZED IN THE '50s BUT ONGOING SEND THE END OF THE CIVIL WAR. WHAT WE ARE SEEING TODAY IS A SMALL STEP, BUT A SMALL STEP FORWARD, IN RECOGNIZING THE RIGHTS OF SAME-SEX COUPLES BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT, AS YOU RIGHTLY POINT OUT, 70% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE FOR. THIS IS A GREAT FIRST STEP. THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT. IF CONGRESS REALLY WANTS TO TAKE A BIG STEP FORWARD, THEY SHOULD ALSO, IN THE LAME DUCK SESSION, PASS THE EQUALITY ACT, WHICH PASSED THE HOUSE. IT'S IN THE SENATE. IF THEY WERE TO DO THAT NOW IN THE LAME DUCK SESSION, THEN GENDER IDENTITY, SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND ONE OTHER CHARACTERISTIC WOULD BE ADDED TO THE 1964 CIVIL RIGHTS ACT SO THAT A COUPLE -- SAME-SEX COUPLE OR INTERRACIAL COUPLE THAT GETS MARRIED ON SUNDAY WILL HAVE ALL OF THEIR RIGHTS PROTECTED AS A MATTER OF FEDERAL LAW ON MONDAY. THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE EVICTED OR LOSE THEIR JOBS SIMPLY BASED ON THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR THEIR GENDER IDENTITY. IF THE SENATE DOESN'T MOVE ON THE EQUALITY ACT BEFORE -- IN THIS LAME DUCK SESSION, THEN WE START ALL OVER AGAIN WITH THE NEW CONGRESS.  A NEW CONGRESS WITH A REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED HOUSE, WITH A LOT OF LOONEYS IN IT. JONATHAN, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU.  THANKS. > WHEN WE COME BACK, A WHISTLE-BLOWER LAYS OUT HIS EFFORT TO RECRUIT AN ARMY OF, QUOTE, STEALTH MISSIONARIES TO TRY TO INFLUENCE THE MINDS OF CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES ON THE NATION'S HIGHEST COURT.

        "trs": "AND NOW THAT WE'RE ABLE TO, I'M SORRY, NO, I'M NOT FATIGUED. POLLS CLOSE FROM TODAY WAS A WET AND COLD ELECTION DAY IN GEORGIA THAT FOLLOWED DAYS OF RECORD-BREAKING TURNOUT AMONG EARLY VOTERS THERE. \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTS EARLIER, FULTON COUNTY, THE STATE'S MOST POPULATED COUNTY SAID NONE OF ITS 249 POLLING PRECINCTS HAD WAIT TIMES LONGER THAN 30D  MINUTES. THAT'S A STARK CONTRAST FROM LAST WEEK WHEN SOME IN THE ATLANTA AREA WAITED MORE THAN TWO HOURS TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS. AS FOR WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE CANDIDATES, \"THE TIMES\" ADDS THIS, \"TQUOTE. DEMOCRATIC ELECTION MODELERS BELIEVE MR. WARNOCK MAY HAVE BUILT A LARGE LEAD, A LEAD AS LARGE AS 8 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN EARLY  PVOTING. I IF THAT IS THE CASE, MR. WALKER COULD NEED TO WIN AS MUCH AS 60% OF THE ELECTION DAY VOTES TO CATCH UP. NOT IMPOSSIBLE, BUT A HIGH BAR. NO MATTER WHAT THE OUTCOME OF TODAY'S ELECTION HISTORY WILL BE MADE, GEORGIA WILL ELECT ITS FIRST EVER BLACK SENATOR TO A FULL TERM IN THE U.S. SENATE. IN OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY'S HISTORY, THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN 11 BLACK EN SENATORS. BUT FOR MANY, THIS MOMENT IS ALSO A BITTERSWEET ONE. MORE REPORTING IN \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" FINDS THIS. QUOTE, IN CONVERSATIONS WITH MORE THAN TWO DOZEN BLACK VOTERS ACROSS GEORGIA, MANY SAID THEY DID NOT SEE MR. WALKER WHO HAS TAKEN A W CONCILIATORY APPROACHO MATTERS OF RACE AS REPRESENTING THE INTERESTS OF BLACK PEOPLE. FAR MORE THAN A VICTORY FOR RACIAL REPRESENTATION, THEY CASP THE ELECTION IN TERMS OF NOW FAMILIAR POLITICAL STAKES.MI A CHANCE TO KEEP A REPUBLICAN BACKED BYLI DONALD TRUMP FROM GAINING POWER AND WORKING TO REVERSE POLICIES THEY CARE Y ABOUT. SENATOR WARNOCK EXPRESSED THE CHOICE BEFORE GEORGIANS WHILE SPEAKING TO OUR COLLEAGUE JOY REID LAST NIGHT.  THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA DESERVF A SERIOUS CANDIDATE. AND THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IN A STATE THAT'S NOT KNOWN TO BE A SPLIT TICKET STATE, PEOPLE ARE MAKING THEOP CHOICES THAT THEY' MAKING BECAUSE, LOOK, THIS RACE AT THIS POINT GIVEN MY OPPONENT, THIS RACE IS NOT EVEN ABOUT REPUBLICAN VERSUS DEMOCRAT, RED VERSUS BLUE, RIGHT VERSUS LEFT. IT'S RIGHT VERSUS WRONG. AND I THINKHT PEOPLE SEE THAT.  WOW. T THAT'S WHERE WE BEGIN OUR COVERAGE TODAY WITH SOME OF OUR FAVORITE W REPORTERS AND FRIEND. MSNBC CORRESPONDENT TRYMAINE LEE IS LIVE FOR US AT A GET OUT THE VOTE EVENT ACROSS THE STREET FROM AVE POLLING LOCATION IN ATLANTA. JOINING US HERE AT THE TABLE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST BASIL AT HUNTER COLLEGE. MICHIGAN'S SECRETARY OF STATE JOCELYN BENSON IS HERE. MY COLLEAGUE ALICIA MENENDEZ IS HERE. SHE IS THE HOST OF MSNBC'S \"AMERICAN VOICES.\" LET ME START WITH YOU, TRYMAINE. TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE HEARING AND SEEING.  AFTER THE MARATHON DURING THE GENERAL ELECTION AND THE SPRINT TO THE RUNOFF, THERE WAS THE SPRINT ABOUT ENTHUSIASM AND EXCITEMENT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CANBO E SEE BEHIND ME, THIS HAS BEEN GOING ALL DAY LONG. ORGANIZERS AND VOTING RIGHTS. YOU SEE THIS. THEY ARE GETTING BUSY. THEY'RE MAKING SURE THAT FOLKS S -- IF YOU DON'T KNOW WH THE DI IS, THERE IS A PARTY AT THE POLLS. SO MANY PEOPLE, CERTAINLY THERE ARE POLICY CONCERNS. AND IT'S CLARITY ABOUT WHO THEY WANT TO VOTE FOR. IT'S ABOUT MORE THAN POLICY ISSUES, ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND HEALTH CARE AND THE ECONOMY. IT'SLT BIGGER THAN THAT. NOW I SPOKE TO A BUNCH OF VOTERS TODAY ABOUT WHAT DROVE THEM TO THE POLLS, THE MISSION THEY'RE ON, AND HERE'S WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY.PO WE DON'T HAVE -- WE DON'T HAVE THE SOUND? ANY WAY, WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD --  WE'LL FIND IT. GO AHEAD.  NO, THEY'RE SO DRIVEN. YOU TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO CANDIDATES WHERE THEY SEE ONE MAN, RAPHAEL WARNOCK FOR THE MOST PART CARRYING THE TRADITIONS OF DR. KING ANDNG JOHN LEWIS AT THE HE OF THE EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH. AND THEY SEE THE OTHER HERSCHEL WALKER AS CARRYING FOR DONALD TRUMP. EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE DIVIDES, THERE IS AN EMBARRASSMENT, A SHAME. THEY SAID TIME AND AGAIN TO A PERSON OLDER, YOUNGER IS THAT THE GOPGE THINKS SO LITTLE OF BLACK PEOPLE THAT THIS IS THE BEST BLACKTH CANDIDATE THEY COU PRODUCE, THAT THEY THOUGHT WOULD SHAVE OFF BLACK SUPPORT AND THEN PLANT A NARRATIVE ABOUT BLACK MEN NOT BEING PLUGGED INTO THIS. BUT ALL DAY LONG THERE HAVE BEEN BLACKHE MEN, BLACK WOMEN, YOUNG AND OLD WHO HAVE BEEN BRINGING THEIR CHILDREN OUTVE HOARE, JUS TO BE A PART OF THIS DAY BECAUSE IT'SF  NOT LOST ON THEM THE STAS OF THE MOMENT.  TRYMAINE, I THINK WE MIGHT HAVENK ROBBED YOUR SOUND FROM Y AND PLAYED TO IT BUMP IN THE HOUR. BUT IITP  HEARD A VOTER SAY \"I NOT FATIGUED.\" THERE IS SO MUCH ASKED OF GEORGIA VOTERS. THEY'RE ASKED TO VOTE IN A GENERAL. THEY'RE ASKED TO LEARN NEW RULES. EVEN THOUGH THEEA REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR AND REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATES SWORE UP AND DOWN THERE WAS NO FRAUD, THEY PASSED AN ANTI-FRAUD LAW. THEY'RE ASKED TO COME OUT AND VOTE AGAIN IN A RUNOFF. IT'S REMARKABLE AND MOVING TO HEAR THEM SAY \"WE ARE NOT FATIGUED.\" JUST TALK ABOUT THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE GEORGIA VOTER.  I TELL YOU WHAT, THEY'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE. THERE ARE PROBABLY A FEW PLACES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT HAVE THE ROBUST VOTING APPARATUS. ALL KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS TOUCHING PEOPLE WHO ARE HARD TO REACH IN RURAL COMMUNITIES, IN THE HEART OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY. THERE IS A BIG CONCERN ABOUT VOTER SUPPRESSION. AND FOLKS SAY LOOK AT EARLY T VOTING. THERE IS NO SUPPRESSION HERE.EA TODAY AT THIS POLLING PLACE THAT WAS PRETTY BUSY ALL DAY. THE LAST HOUR, ABOUT 20, 25  H PEOPLE, WE COUNTED THEM WHO CAMT OUT AND THEY WERE TURNED AWAY. THEY SAID WE VOTED HERE FOR YEARS. NOW YOU H HAVE THE WRONG PRECIN. THEY VOTE HERE IN THE GENERAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER, BUT THEN THEY WERE TURNED AWAY, INCLUDING AN 82-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, ANOTHER GENTLEMAN IN THEAN WHEELCHAIR. I ASKED IS THIS FRUSTRATING? YOU GOT TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. SO THEY GOT IN THEIR CARS AND FIGURED OUT WHERE THEY HAD TO GO. THIS IS DOZENS OF PEOPLE WHO HAD THEPE WRONG PLACE. THAT'S THE KIND OF THING. IMAGINE THAT IT'S 20 HERE AND 20 SOMEWHERE ELSE AND 100 IN ANOTHER COUNTY WHAT THAT COULD DO. AND THAT WAST  ALWAYS THE BIG FEAR, A THAT BY A THOUSAND CUTS YOU CAN REALLY CHANGE AND RESHAPE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE WHOLE ELECTION.  ESPECIALLY IN A RUNOFF THAT WAS THIS CLOSE IN A GENERAL.EC TRYMAINE, I WANT TO ASK YOU TO SAY A LITTLE MORE ABOUT SOMETHING YOU SAID WHEN YOU FIRST CAME ON THE AIR, ABOUT THE FEELINGS ABOUT HERSCHEL WALKER AS THIS REALLY CYNICAL MOVE BY REPUBLICANS.  WELL, IT'S CONCERNING ON ONE HAND WHENNC YOU HEAR CLEAR POLI POINTS, A MAN WHO SEEMS DIGNIFIED, RAPHAEL WARNOCK, A MAN OF FAITH. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE ALLEGATIONS ON THE OTHER SIDE ABOUT NOT JUST THE HYPOCRISY AROUND PROVIDING FUNDS FOR ABORTIONS, BUT THEN SUPPORTING A NATIONWIDE BAN, BUT ALSO TALKING ABOUT YOU'RE A MAN OF GOD, BUT THERE ARE O ALLEGATIONS OF ASSAT AGAINST WOMEN. THAT IS REALLY CONCERNING. BUT IN ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE, YOU THINK OF THE NEARLY 2,000 PEOPLE WHO SERVED IN CONGRESS, YOU MENTIONED EARLIER, ONLY 11 HAVE BEEN AFRICAN AMERICAN. OF THOSE WERE DURING THE RECONSTRUCTION ERA. SO THE FACT THAT UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES WITH PERHAPS A DIFFERENT CANDIDATE, TWO BLACK MEN IN GEORGIA, THIS FORMER HEART OF THE CONFEDERACY HERE VYING FOR A SEAT IN THE SENATE WOULD BE A BIG HISTORIC DEAL.RI BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE ASHAMED TO BE ASSOCIATED. PEOPLE ASSOCIATE BLACKNESS AND WHAT AFRICAN AMERICAN IS TO THIS MAN, HERSCHEL WALKER.  HERSCHEL WALKER HASN'T DONE R TON OF CAMPAIGNING, OR AT LEAST COMPARED TO HIS OPPONENT HE HAS DONE FAR LESS CAMPAIGNING. WHAT IS THE WALKER SORT OF CLOSING MESSAGE AS FAR AS YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT?  WELL, THE LAST FEW DAYS, WE HEARD HIM TALK A LOT ABOUT PRONOUNS, RIGHT.UT WE HEARD HIM TALK ABOUT WEREWOLVES AND VAMPIRES. THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM A FOA LOT OF PEOPLE. AT THE VERY LEAST, IF YOU TRUST CONSERVATIVING TO BE WHO THEY FI ARE, THEY HAVE SOLID SPEAKING POINTS ABOUT FAITH AND WHAT SHOULD BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS AND AT LEAST CRITICAL RACE THEORY, SOMETHING FOLKS CAN GRASP ON TO. BUT HE SEEMS TO BE ON THE FRINGES OF EVEN THAT MESSAGE. SO THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH. EVEN HE SHOWED UP AT A FOOTBALL GAME. HERSCHEL WALKER WAS A GREAT FOOTBALL PLAYER, BUT DIDN'T EVEN SPEAK. HE CAME OUT, PHOTO OP AND WENT BACK IN THEHO BUS. THEY THINK IS VERY TELLING ABOUT HIS GAME PLAN THE LAST FEW DAYS.  I THINK IT'S WHAT MITCH McCONNELL DESCRIBED I AS A CANDIDATE QUALITY PROBLEM, TRYMAINE LEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR STARTING US OFF. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING AND FORYO BEING WHERE YOU ARE.ER IT'S GREAT TO SEE EVERYBODY OUTU THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. > BASIL, TRYMAINE GOT RIGHT TO IT HOW DO YOU FEEL?  FIRST OF ALL, I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THIS. WHICH ACTUALLY CHANGED IN THE LAST TWO MINUTES BECAUSE OF TRYMAINE'S REPORTING.'S IT'S A FANTASTIC REPORT, AND I LOVE TO SEE THAT ENERGY. IT'SE  ABOUT SUBSTANTIVE ST REPRESENTATION, NOT NOMINAL.  CORRECT.  THAT'S WHAT HE IS SAYING THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAVE PUT UP, JUST ANOTHER BLACK GUY IN THE BELIEF THAT BLACK PEOPLE WILL VOTE FOR THE BLACK GUY. NOT WANTING TO UNDERSTAND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE COMMUNITY AND THE FACT THERE IS THIS NOTION CALLED SHARED FATE. THE SENSE THAT WHAT HAPPENS TO ONE WILL HAPPEN TO MANY OF US ALL. WHEN YOU PUT SOMEONE LIKE HERSCHEL WALKER ON THE BALLOT, IS THAT THE PERSON YOU'RE GOING TO HOLDPE US ACCOUNTABLE TO? IS THAT THE PERSON WHO YOU SAY IS GOING TO BE OUR STANDARD BEARER? AND THE O VOTERS ARE LIKE NO, WE'RE ABSOLUTELY NOT. ABSOLUTELY NOT HAVING THAT. WHEN I WAS ON THE LAST TIME AND TALKING WITH YOU AND REVEREND SHARPTON, WE TALKED ABOUT THE CADENCE OF A PREACHER. THIS RACE HAS HAD A CADENCE TO IT.  YES.  JESUS IS NOT ON THE BALLOT, BUT HE IS ESSENTIALLY SAYING EVERYTHING THAT JESUS STOOD FOR IS ON THE BALLOT. AND THEYIS SORT OF ARCED THEIR CAMPAIGN THAT WAY.  AND TO LAND ON IT. BECAUSE WHEN O ALL OF THE JOURNALISM WAS REVEALING ALL OF HERSCHEL WALKER'S O HYPOCRISY, WHICH ISCH WHAT THE ABORTION STY IS. IT'S NOT ABOUT JUST THE ABORTIONS. IT'S ABOUT WHAT TRYMAINE JUST SAID. IT'S BEING A NATIONAL BANNER FOR EVERYBODY ELSE AFTER PAYING FOR FIVE, SIX HIMSELF.  THAT'S RIGHT.F.  IT'S THE HYPOCRISY HE WOULD CARRY. HE FITCA IN PERFECTLY IN THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS, BUT HE WOULD NOT BE A GOOD --  IT'S THE HYPOCRISY. AND ACCORDING TO REVEREND WALKER, ESPECIALLY FROM THE PULPITES HE USES EVERY SUNDAY, IS ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE. H AND MOVING --  YOU KNOW, I SENT THIS TO OFFICER HARRY DUNN IN THE LAST HOUR. IT'S CLEAR THAT VOTERS HEARD YOU. YOU'VE BEEN WARNING US ABOUT THREATS TO OUR DEMOCRACY SINCE BEFORE THE 2020 ELECTION. AND I KNOW YOU JUST REVEALED THAT THERE ARE STILL THREATS AGAINST YOU THAT WE'RE GOING GET INTO LATER IN THE HOUR. L BUT THIS CAMPAIGN, IT IS A RUNOFF IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA AND ITSAT BACKDROP IS THIS ENDANGERED DEMOCRACY THATTH WE L LIVE AND  DVOTE.  AND YOU SEE THE VOTERS' RESPONSE. THE RESILIENCY AND THE DETERMINATION TO VOTE ANY WAY.  RIGHT.  AND ENSURE NO MATTER HOW MANY HURDLES THEY HAVE TO OVERCOME, THEIR VOICE IS GOING TO BE HEARD, THEIR VOICE IS GOING TO BE T COUNTED AND IT'S INSPIRINGO SEE THAT RESILIENCY OF VOTERS REFLECT THE RESILIENY OF OUR DEMOCRACY.  GEORGIA IS A COMPLICATED STORY. YOU HAVE ESPECIALLY IN SECRETARY OF STATE E RAFFENSPERGER TWO ME WHICHPE MITCH McCONNELL AND KEV McCARTHY WON'T DO. THEY STOOD UP TO TRUMP. THEY REFUSED TO CARRY OUT HIS COUP PLOT IN GEORGIA. BUT THEY DID BACK A VOTER SUPPRESSION LAW. AND YOU DO HAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME VOTERS HERE HAVING TO VOTE UNDER NEW RULES. THE EARLY VOTE NUMBER IS INCREDIBLE. THE MAIL VOTE IS ABYSMAL, DOWN 81%, DOWN EVEN MORE IN NOVEMBER THAN MICHIGAN'S NUMBER. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE INSIDIOUS EFFORTS TO MAKE IT HARDER TO VOTE?  WELL, IT'S CLEARLY A STRATEGY. NOT JUST IN GEORGIA, BUT NATIONALLY TO PUT HURDLES IN PLACE TO CONFUSE VOTERS AS WELL AS CHANGING THE RULES TO MAKE IT MORE CHAOTIC WHEN THEY DO SHOW UP TO VOTE. AND THAT'S SOME OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING. IT ALSO REALLY UNDERSCORES THAT NO MATTER WHAT POLITICIANS MAY DO TO TRY TO IMPACT OUR DEMOCRACY OR RESTRICT ACCESS FOR HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN PARTICULAR, PEOPLE WILL STILL RISE TO THE OCCASION AND MEET THE MOMENT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN GEORGIA.  I AGREE WITH THAT. BUT THE OPERATIVE IN ME, THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO. OF COURSE NOT.  DEMOCRATS SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RETRAIN THEIR VOTERS EVERY YEAR HOW TO VOTE BECAUSE REPUBLICANS CHANGE THE LAWS PREDICATED ON BS.  YOU ALSOIC LOOK AT HOW THIS PLAYED OUT, RIGHT THERE. IS AN ASCENDANT COALITION IN GEORGIA IN A BUNCH OF STATES LED BY BLACK VOTERS WHO ARE CONTINUALLY HANDING VICTORY TO DEMOCRATS. REPUBLICANS WATCHED THAT HAPPEN ANDBL THEY INTRODUCED SOMETHING LIKENT SB-202 THAT THEY SAY IS JUST ABOUTAT LOGISTICS AND MAKI THINGS EASIER. IT MAY BE MAKING THINGS EASIER FOR THEM.  TO WIN.  IT IS MAKING THINGS HARDER FOR THESE VOTERS. AND SOE  IT STRIKES ME ALSO THA YOU HAVE SENATOR WARNOCK, SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF THIS FIGHT IN THE U.S. SENATE, POSITIONING IT, POSITIONING VOTING RIGHTS AS A QUESTION OF MORALITY. BECAUSE O HE UNDERSTANDS THE STATES. AND WE TALK SO OFTEN, ESPECIALLY ON THIS PROGRAM ABOUT TRUMP AND TRUMPISM AND HOW TO SORT OF ROOT IT OUT. YOU AND I AGREE IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO GET RID OF TRUMP OR HAVE TRUMP BE ACCOUNTABLE. THERE ARE A SLEW OF CANDIDATES THAT WE HAVE SEEN REJECTED. AND I'M NOT JUST TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WALKER WINS TONIGHT. I'M TALKING ABOUT DeSANTIS. IT'S ALSO ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SEEDS OF TRUMPISM WERE PLANTED LONGF  BEFORE HE EVER CE DOWN THAT ESCALATOR.  YEAH.  AND IF YOU REALLY WANT TO ROOT IT OUT, YOU HAVE TO PULL UP THE ROOTS AND BE HONEST ABOUT THE VOTER SUPPRESSION EFFORTS THAT EXISTED BEFORE HE WAS EVER IN THE PICTURE.  AND I GUESS JUST TO NOT LET THESE REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS RELATIVE, RIGHT, IN,  THE 24/7 NEWS CYCLE, KEVIN RAFFENSPERGER RELATIVE TO DeSANTIS ANDER ABBOTT ARE BETTE. THEY STILL PUT INTO LAW SOMETHING THAT IS HAVING -- WE WILL BE COVERING TONIGHT THE EFFECT OF A VOTER SUPPRESSION LAW THAT WAS PUT INTO PLACE BECAUSE OF THE LAW. IT WASAC THE PEBBLE THEY THREW TRUMP BECAUSE THEY  PREFUSED TOO THE FULL COUP.  IT'S BECAUSE I LIKE THIS RIGHT/WRONG PARADIGM AND YOU'RE ON A TABLE FULL OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATORS. THAT IS A GUT CHECK. IT'S NOT A HEAD CHECK. IT'S NOT HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS POLICY. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THIS PERSON IS RIGHT OR WRONG? TRYMAINE DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF LAYING OUT THE MANY ACCUSATIONS AGAINST WALKER. I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU HAVE A PERSON WHO IS OF QUESTIONABLE CHARACTER, QUESTIONABLE COMPETENCE, WHICH DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT HE IS PRIMARILY A VESSEL FOR TRUMPISM, AND THE FACT THAT REPUBLICANS PLAN TO,  RUN THIS RACE THE WAY THEY PLAN TO RUN ARIZONA AND NEVADA AS BEING ALL ABOUT JOE BIDEN, RIGHT. THEY WERE GOING TO SAY THIS INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC S SENATOR VOTED WITH JOE BIDEN 94, 96% OF THE TIME THAT WAS NOT THE KILLER ARGUMENT THAT THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE.  THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT WHAT REVEREND WARNOCK DID WAS NOT MAKERN IT ABOUT A REFERENDU ON BIDEN HIMSELF. HE ACTUALLY DID SOMETHING WHICH A LOT OF CANDIDATES DON'T OFTEN GET TO DO, WHICH IS NOT NATIONALIZE THE RACE. AS MUCH NATIONAL ATTENTION IS ON IT, HE HASTT FOCUSED A LOT ON T PEOPLE OF GEORGIA AND ON SOLVING THE PROBLEMS OF GEORGIA. SO MUCH SO THAT EVEN KEEPING JOE BIDEN AT ARM'S LENGTH A LITTLE BIT, WHICH HAS ACTUALLY HELPED HIM. ANDED SO TO ME, INCREDIBLY SMAR AND TRUE STRATEGY IN DOING. SO AND TO YOUR POINTS, AND I FEEL QUITE STRONGLY ABOUT THIS, THE REFERENDUM ON TRUMP AND TRUMPISM IN THIS COUNTRYN  THATE SAW IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, THAT IS PLAYING ALL OUT RIGHT THERE IN GEORGIA IN THIS ELECTION.  AND TO YOUR POINT, IT'S SOMETHING MATT DOWD SAYS ALL THE TIME. SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK DIDN'T HAVE TO BE TOLD BY A CAMPAIGN ADVISER TO GO FOR THE GUT WITH THE VOTERS. IT IS HOW HE GOVERNS.  THAT'S RIGHT.ER  HE IS HOW HE LEADS. IT IS HOW HE LEADS, YOU KNOW, IN THE PULPIT. IT IS HOW HE LEADS AS A PUBLIC OFFICIAL. AND IT IS REALLY -- GOVERNOR WHITMER - LEARNED HOW TO DO THI TOO. THESE SUCCESSFUL FIGURES IN THIS DEMOCRATIC PARTY, LIKE YOURSELF, UNDERSTAND HOW TO SPEAK TO PEOPLE'S GUT ABOUT RIGHT AND WRONG.  BECAUSE IT'S IN OUR GUT TOO. I MET WHEN HE WAS REVEREND WARNOCK FIVE YEARS AGO DOING A VOTER REGISTRATION EFFORT BOTH OF US WERE DOING WITH THE ATLANTA HAWKS. THIS IS WHO WE ARE, WHO HE IS. SPEAKING FROM THE GUT AND CONNECTING TO OTHERS BASED ON THOSE SRAMS CO VALUES COMES NAT.  I OFTEN THINK OF YOU AS I'M TRYING TO LAY MY HEAD DOWN ON THEMY PILLOW TONIGHT.OW I HAD ASKED YOU PRIOR TO THE MIDTERMS WHAT HAPPENS IF ALL THESE ELECTION DEHIGHS NEAR DON'T GET REJECTED? YOU SAID IT'SN' A FIVE-ALARM ALM FOR OUR DEMOCRACY. THIS IS ALSO ABOUT SETTING THE STAKES FOR VOTERS. THERE IS THIS QUESTIONST OF RIG AND WRONG AND THE QUESTION OF WHAT IS ON THE LINE. WHILE WHAT IS ON THE LINE CAN SOUND VERY TECHNOCRATIC. VOTERS DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT POWER SHARE AGREEMENTS IN THE SENATE, WHAT IS THE JUDICIARY GOING TO LOOK LIKE IN THE NEXT FIVE, TEN YEARS? AND WHAT ARE THE DECISIONS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE ON SOMETHING LIKE VOTING RIGHTS? THE STAKES RIGHT NOW COULD NOT BE HIGHER. AND I ALSO THINK THAT SENATOR WARNOCK HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF ARTICULATING THOSE.  TO ALICIA'S POINT, HE PICKED THE NATIONAL ISSUE THAT IS THE MOST T UNIFYING, THE RIGHT TO VOTE. WHAT PREDICATES LIFE IN A DEMOCRACY? IT'S THE RIGHT TO VOTE, RIGHT. BUT AS A GOVERNOR, ON HIS WEBSITE OR CAMPAIGN ADS, THEY'RE ABOUT BIPARTISAN ACCOMPLISHMENTS. HE IS VERY IN TOUCH WITH THE MOST UNIFYING NATURAL ISSUES AND REALLY GOVERNING VERY MUCH IN TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA.  IF YOU LISTEN TO THOSE VOTERS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS SEGMENT, WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE TO ME IS THAT THEY FEEL -- I'M SURE THEY FELT THIS BEFORE, BUT CERTAINLY ISTODAY, THAT THEY HA AGENCY. THAT THEY CAN MAKE THE CHANGE THAT THEY WANT TO SEE RIGHT HERE TODAY IN THESE POLLS. AND THAT -- THERE IS NO GREATER FEELING FOR A VOTER THAN THAT, REALLY. WIN OR LOSE, WHETHER YOUR CANDIDATE WINS OR LOSES, BUT THE ABILITY TO SAY NO, I CAN MAKE SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE AS LONG AS I JUST PULL THIS LEVER, COLOR IN THAT CIRCLE. AS LONG AS I ACTUALLY VOTE AND EXERCISE THAT RIGHT, CHANGE IS GOING TO HACOME. YOU HEARD THAT COME OUT.  AND KNOW THAT IT'S GOING TO BE COUNTED.  YES.  I WANT TO ASK YOU TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE YOUR HEAD ON THE PILLOW. AND I TOO AM USUALLY KEPT AWAKE. ARE WE EXHALING? DO YOU FEEL BETTER? DO I THINK IT TOO SOON TO EXHALE. WE'RE GOING GET THROUGH TONIGHT. BUT I THINK THERE IS ALSO THIS QUESTION OF HOW REPUBLICANS CHOOSE TO GOVERNOR AND HOW THEY CHOOSE TO LEGISLATE AND THEY'VE GIVEN NO INDICATION THAT WE'RE TURNING A CORNER.  RIGHT.  THINK ABOUT THE EMBERS OF ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WE'VE SEEN JUST SINCE YOU CAME ON AIR AT 4:00 P.M. AND THE AMOUNT OF BREAKING NEWS. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO COME OUT OF NEW YORK. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING TO COMENG FROM DOJ. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S GOING COME -- IT COULD COME FROM VOTERS. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THAT IN THE MIDTERMS. I THINK TONIGHT COULD SORT OF LEND THE FINAL MESSAGE. BUT FUNDAMENTALLY, IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN TO WHETHER OR NOT REPUBLICANS DECIDE THAT IT'S TIME TO CHANGE.  BUT SINCE THEY LOST THE SENATE AGAIN, THE SECOND TIME UNDER IMTRUMP, AND EKED OUT A VY NARROW --  THAT WAS VICIOUS AGAIN. AGAIN.  THEY'VE DOUBLED DOWN. THEY'VE REFUSED TO COME OUT AND DISTANCE. NONE OF THEM HAS SAID WE WON'T SUPPORT TRUMP AFTER DINING WITH AN ANTI-SEMITE AND WHITE SUPREMACIST. THAT'S HIS JOB DESCRIPTION ON WIKIPEDIA. AFTER SAYING HE WOULD TEAR UP THE CONSTITUTION. AR I WAS ABOUT TO SAY THAT.  THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SEEMS TO BE GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE ANY PART OF THIS.  I G AGREE. I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GO FROM HERE.  DOWN, DOWN, DOWN. ALL RIGHT. I KNOW YOU HAVE TO GO. YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON THE AIR FROM WHAT?AI  I WAS HERE TAKING A NAP ON YOUR COUCH. I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU. YES, I'LL BE HERE AT 1:00 A.M.E  UNTIL THE END. ALL OF THE VOTES COUNTED. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND STARTING US OFF. JOCELYN AND BASEL DO NOT HAVE TO START THEIR SHIFT AT 1:00 A.M. STICK AROUND. WHEN WEAPON COME BACK, TWO YEARS AFTER 2020, TWO YEARS AFTER THE BIG LIE WAS FIRST TOLD, AND A MONTH AFTERTO WINNING REELECTIO SECRETARY OF STATE JOCELYN BENSON STILL FACES THREATS OF VIOLENCE FROM ELECTION DENIERS. WE'LL HAVE THAT CONVERSATION NEXT. > PLUS, THERE ARE BIG CONCERNS THAT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WITH ITS 6-3 SUPER CONSERVATIVE MAJORITY WON'T DO THE RIGHT THING WHEN IT COMES TO AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.

        "trs": "> IMMEDIATELY, I SAW THAT THE WHITE HOUSE ON MY BLUETOOTH WAS CALLING, AND I TOOK THE CALL. MR. GIULIANI CAME ON FIRST. AND NICETIES. THEN MR. TRUMP, PRESIDENT TRUMP, THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP CAME ON. HE SAID, WELL, WE HAVE HEARD BY AN OFFICIAL HIGH UP IN THE REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE THAT THERE IS A LEGAL THEORY, OR A LEGAL ABILITY IN ARIZONA THAT YOU CAN REMOVE THE ELECTORS OF PRESIDENT BIDEN AND REPLACE THEM.  YOU CAN'T. NOT A THING. THAT WAS FORMER ARIZONA SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE RUSTY BOWERS TESTIFYING UNDER OATH THAT THE JANUARY 6th SELECT COMMITTEE ABOUT THE TWICE IMPEACHED EX-PRESIDENT'S AND ALLIES' ATTEMPTS TO REPRESENT ILLEGAL THEORIES IN SERVICE OF SUBVERTING FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. SO FAST FORWARD TO TOMORROW WHEN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR ORAL ARGUMENTS IN A CASE THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING THESE KINDS OF THEORIES. THIS ONE IS KNOWN AS THE INDEPENDENT STATE LEGISLATURE THEORY OUT OF THE SHADOWS AND INTO THE MAINSTREAM, GIVING ELECTION DENIERS ANOTHER SHOT AT USING THE VERY SAME TACTICS THEY USED TO TRY TO OVERTURN THE 2020 ELECTION IN 2024. ELECTION LAW EXPERT RICK HASSAN WRITING IN A FRIEND OF THE COURT BRIEF LAYS OUT THIS CRISIS AND WHAT WOULD BE CREATED IF THE SUPREME COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF THIS THEORY. HE DESCRIBES IT LIKE THIS. QUOTE, PETITIONER'S EXPANSIVE READING OF THE ELECTIONS KLAUS IS ONE OF NOT ONLY DECREASED PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES ELECTION SYSTEM, BUT IN THE STATE AND FEDERAL JUDICIARIES AS WELL. AT ITS EXTREME, THE INDEPENDENT LEGISLATURE THEORY COULD PAVE THE WAY TO SUBVERT LEGITIMATE ELECTION RESULTS, LEADING TO ELECTION LOSERS RATHER THAN ELECTION WINNERS TAKING OFFICE. PETITIONER'S EXPANSIVE INTERPRETATION THREATENS AMERICAN DEMOCRACY ITSELF. JOINING OUR CONVERSATION THE AFOREMENTIONED RICK TASSN AS LL AS MSNBC ELECTION ANALYST. MY FIRST QUESTION, WHY HASN'T THIS RECEIVED MORE ATTENTION IF TOMORROW THE ARGUMENTS WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE SUPREME COURT?  WELL, I THINK THE FIRST THING IS THAT IT'S A REALLY TECHNICAL LEGAL ARGUMENT. EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS ABORTION RIGHTS ARE UNDER ATTACK OR A KIND OF FIRST AMENDMENT TYPE OF CASE. BUT THIS IS A CASE ABOUT WHETHER A STATE COURT CAN APPLY A STATE CONSTITUTION TO LIMIT WHAT A FEDERAL -- TO LIMIT WHAT A STATE LEGISLATURE DOES IN A FEDERAL ELECTION. EVEN JUST TO SAY IT, IT'S SO COMPLICATED. BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS IT WOULD TAKE AWAY ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT STATE COURTS USE TO PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS WHICH IS PROTECTING THEM UNDER THEIR STATE CONSTITUTIONS. AND IT WOULD GIVE STATE LEGISLATURES MUCH MORE POWER IN TERMS OF SETTING THE RULES FOR ELECTIONS, AND IT WOULD BASICALLY CREATE THE CONDITIONS WHERE ANY TIME A STATE COURT OR A STATE ELECTION ADMINISTRATOR DID ANYTHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY RAISE A QUESTION IN STATE COURT, IT CREATES GROUNDS FOR THE FEDERAL COURTS TO GET INVOLVED TOO. SO DOUBLING THE AMOUNT OF LITIGATION, AND ULTIMATELY MAKING THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT THE ULTIMATE ARBITER OVER WHAT STATE COURTS MEAN HEN THEY INTERPRET THEIR OWN CONSTITUTIONS. AND THAT IS PRETTY RADICAL.  WHAT ARE THE MOTIVES OF THE SIDE THAT IS BEHIND IT?  SO I THINK ONE THING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT IN NORTH CAROLINA, THE STATE LEGISLATURE CALLED THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY THERE GETS TO DRAW DISTRICT LINES. THE GOVERNOR DOESN'T HAVE A ROLE. EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR, A REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE DREW THESE LINES, AND A DEMOCRATIC DOMINATED STATE SUPREME COURT SAID WHAT YOU DID, YOU ENGAGED IN A PARTISAN GERRYMANDER AGAINST THE STATE CONSTITUTION. WHAT THAT DID ESSENTIALLY IS IT PUT THE STATE COURT ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND I THINK THE LEGISLATURES SEE THIS AS A PARTISAN BATTLE. AND THEY SEE -- WE SAW THE SAME THING IN PENNSYLVANIA. REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE, DEMOCRATIC-DOMINATED SUPREME COURT. THEY SEE THE STATE CONSTITUTION TO PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS AS A PARTISAN ATTACK ON THEIR POWER. THAT'S WHY WEE SEE THIS CASE HERE WITH LOTS OF BRIEFS FILED ON BOTH SIDES BECAUSE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH.  RICK, THE NEW YORK SOMETIMES IS REPORTING THAT FOUR SUPREME COURT JUSTICES HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED AT LEAST TENTATIVE SUPPORT FOR THE THEORY. HOW WOULD YOU -- I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T LIKE TO HANDICAP A FINAL OPINION BY THE SUPREME COURT. BUT WHAT'S YOUR DEGREE OF WORRY HEADING INTO THIS?  SO HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW THAT. THIS ISSUE HAS COME UP BEFORE. IT CAME UP IN BUSH VERSUS GORE, THE 2000 CASE THAT DISPUTED THE ELECTION THEN. THREE JUSTICES WERE IN SUPPORT OF THE THEORY THEN. WE KNOW FROM CASES THAT CAME UP IN 2020 ON THE EMERGENCY APPEALS TO THE SUPREME COURT THAT THERE ARE THREE JUSTICES NOW WHO SEEM TO BE ATTRACTED TO THE THEORY. THAT'S GORSUCH, THOMAS AND ALITO. I THINK WE CAN SAFELY SAY THAT THE THREE DEMOCRATIC APPOINTED JUSTICES ARE GOING TO OPPOSE THIS THEORY. SO I'M GOING TO BE WATCHING TOMORROW TO SEE WHAT JUSTICES CAVANAUGH AND BARRETT AS WELL AS CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS THINK. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT WHETHER TEXTS IN HISTORY SUPPORT THIS IDEA, AND ALSO, THIS IS WHAT I PUT FORWARD IN MY BRIEF, THE KIND OF ADMINISTRATIVE CONCERNS THAT COME UP WHEN YOU ESSENTIALLY CREATE CONDITIONS THAT LEAD TO THE DOUBLING OF THE AMOUNT OF ELECTION LITIGATION IN THE COURTS, AND PUTTING THE SUPREME COURT IN THE HOT SEAT ALL THE TIME DECIDING ISSUES WHILE ELECTIONS ARE PENDING. THAT'S NOT A COMFORTABLE POSITION FOR THE COURT.  IT IS EXACTLY, THOUGH, WHAT TRUMP AND HIS ALLIES WANTED. LET ME PLAY FOR YOU SOME OF WHAT RUDY GIULIANI AND JOHN EASTMAN WANTED FROM THE SUPREME COURT.  PRESUMABLY, ACTION LIKE THIS WILL BE CHALLENGED IN THE SUPREME COURT. SHOULD THEY TAKE THIS ACTION, OR SOME OTHER LEGISLATURE, HOW DO YOU SEE THAT ARGUMENT?  WELL, IT COULD GET TO THE SUPREME COURT IT COULD BE PRESENTED TO CONGRESS AT THE JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS WHEN THEY BEGIN OPENING THE BALLOTS AND COUNTING THE BALLOTS. AND IF YOU HAVE THE GOVERNOR'S CERTIFIED SLATE OF ELECTS OR THE AND THE LEGISLATIVE SLATE OF CERTIFIED ELECTORS, UNFORTUNATELY SECTION 15 OF TITLE 3 IS EMBARRASSINGLY BIGGUOUSLY. I THINK THE SUPREME COURT VERY WELL MAY WEIGH. IN.  JUST TO STRIP OFF THE COMPLICATED LEGAL ASPECTS OF THIS, THEY WANTED TO DEFRAUD THE AMERICAN VOTING PUBLIC BY EXPLOITING SOMETHING THAT WAS AMBIGUOUS AND PUT FORTH FAKE ELECTORS. THAT'S WHY DOJ IS INVESTIGATING THE FAKE ELECTORS SCHEME. HOW FAR DOES THIS OPEN THE DOOR TO OUTRIGHT FRAUD IN OUR ELECTIONS?  WELL, THAT'S A GREAT POINT. AND I DON'T USUALLY AGREE WITH JOHN EASTMAN, BUT I THINK HE IS RIGHT THAT THE BIGGEST DANGER IS NOT THAT THE COURTS ARE GOING TO ENDORSE A THEORY THAT STATE LEGISLAORS CAN COME IN AND APPOINT ALTERNATE ELECTORS AFTER THE ELECTION HAS HAPPENED, BUT THAT THE COURTS WOULD STAY OUT OF IT AND REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS WOULD JUST ACCEPT THIS THEORY. AND I ARGUE THAT IN MY BRIEF. I SAID IF THE SUPREME COURT RECOGNIZES A BROAD READING OF THIS INDEPENDENT STATE LEGISLATURE THEORY, IT WOULD BE USED AS A TOOL FOR ELECTION SUBVERSION. AND THE LEGISLATORS REPLIED BRIEF OH, NO, THAT'S A SCURRILOUS SUGGESTION. WE WOULD NEVER THINK THAT IT COULD LEAD TO SOMETHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER PROTECTIONS AGAINST IT. BUT I'M REALLY WORRIED THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE A FIG LEAF FOR TRYING TO STEAL ELECTIONS IN THE FUTURE IF THE COURT EMBRACED WHAT SOME ARE CALLING THE MAXIMALIST VERSION OF THE THEEMPLT.  JOCELYN, THIS WAS ATTEMPTED, OVERTURNING THE WILL OF THE VOTERS OF YOUR STATE AND TRUMP'S TEAM.  FOR THOSE WHO LIVED THROUGH THAT WE KNOW HOW CLOSE WE CAME AND HOW THERE WAS A PATH TO OVERTURNING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE NOT JUST IN MICHIGAN, IN OTHER STATES IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THIS CASE IS ABOUT WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO UPEND THE IMPORTANT CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT THE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT HAVE. AS THE COURTS AND THE LEGISLATURE, THE THREE BRANCHES, COEQUALLY WORK TO ENSURE OUR ELECTIONS WORK AND EVERY VOICE IS HEARD AND EVERY VOICE IS COUNTED. IF THE SUPREME COURT UPENDS THAT AND GIVES UNDUE OR TOO MUCH AUTHORITY TO ONE BRANCH, IN THIS CASE THE LEGISLATURE BRANCH THAT HAPPENS TO GERRYMANDERED DISTRICTS, IT INJECTS PARTISANSHIP EVEN MORE AND UPENDS THE CAREFUL CHECKS AND BALANCES STATES DO HAVE TO PROTECT THE WILL OF EVER VOTER.  BASEL, THIS IS EVERYTHING RICK THAT OFFERED UP, THIS IS EVERYTHING JOCELYN HAS OFFERED UP IN DESTROYING THE CHECKS AND BALANCES. THIS IS A STORY ABOUT A RADICAL U.S. SUPREME COURT THAT WE'RE EVEN TALKING ABOUT THIS.  IT SO HAPPENS THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT THE FEDERALIST PAPERS WITH SOMEBODY TODAY.  OF COURSE YOU WERE. WHILE I WAS CHECKING NETFLIX, YOU WERE READING THE FEDERALIST PAPERS.  POWER IS AN ENCROACHING NATURE. AND TO ME, GOING BACK TO THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OUR GUT INSTINCTS, THIS FEELS LIKE AN ATTEMPT TO CONSOLIDATE POWER AND TO GET RID OF THE CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT WE HAVE IN OUR GOVERNMENT. IF YOU TIE THAT TO WHAT HAPPENED AT MAR-A-LAGO, TRUMP'S ATTEMPT TO INTERVENE WITH THE COURT'S MANDATE FOR THE SEARCH, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT SPONTANEOUS. THIS IS NOT SPONTANEOUS. THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE. THERE HAS TO HAVE BEEN, AND WE'VE ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WAS AN INTELLECTUAL FRAMEWORK THAT IS ALLOWING FOR THIS CONVERSATION TO EVEN TAKE PLACE. SO IT'S A LOT DEEPER THAN JUST BEING IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT TOMORROW. THERE IS AN ENTIRE SORT OF INTELLECTUAL STRAIN OF THINKING, MASSING AS SOME ACADEMIC TRUTH THAT IS CREATING THE WINDOW FOR PEOPLE TO NOT ONLY BELIEVE THIS, BUT TO TAKE TO IT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF OUR GOVERNMENT. AT A TIME WHEN THE COUNTRY IS DIVERSIFYING, YOU HAVE MORE AND MORE STATES HAVING STATE LEGISLATURES LED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR OR BY WOMEN. THIS IS WHAT SCARES FOLKS. THEIND OF LAW MAKING THAT STEMS FROM THAT, THE KIND OF POLICY MAKING THAT STEMS FROM THAT. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO DIAL THAT BACK AND SAY NO, WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE COURTS INVOLVED. IT'S THE STATE LEGISLATURES THAT ARE NOW GOING TO TAKE POWER AGGRESSIVELY AND OVERTURN ALL OF THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEING MADE.  IT'S IMPORTANT, THERE IS NOTHING IN THE U.S. CONSTITUTION THAT WOULD SUGGEST REALLY THAT THIS THEORY IS ONE THAT SHOULD BE ADOPTED. SEVERAL CONSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARS HAVE HEAD OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO EMPOWER ONE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT OVER THE OTHER TWO IN STATES WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SHARED POWER. AND THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY TERRIFYING TO SEE POTENTIALLY THE POWER OF DEMOCRACY REALLY PUSHED TOWARDS PARTISANSHIP IN THE COURT.  IT'S JUST AMAZING OF ANOTHER THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. ONE FROM THE COURTS. IT IS THE THEME. RICK, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING PART OF OUR COVERAGE AND HELPING US UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT IS AT STAKE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO CALL ON YOU ON THE STORY. MICHIGAN SECRETARY OF STATE JOCELYN BENSON, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AT THE TABLE. IT WAS SUCH A TREAT.  THANKS FOR HAVING ME. IT WAS WONDERFUL.  AND BASEL, WE DRAG YOU DOWN HERE ALL THE TIME.

        "trs": "TODAY ARIZONA OFFICIALLY CERTIFIED ITS ELECTION RESULTS AFTER SOME ELECTION DENYING OFFICIALS AND ONE REPUBLICAN COUNTY WERE GIVEN A COURT ORDER TO CERTIFY ELECTION RESULTS. THAT IS WHAT IS COME TO. NEXT YEAR, DEMOCRATS WILL HOLD THE GOVERNORSHIP. SECRETARY OF STATE OFFICE, AND BOTH U.S. SENATE SEATS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OVER 70 YEARS IN ARIZONA. SENATOR MARK KELLY REELECTION IN ARIZONA HELP THE DEMOCRATS PRESERVE THERE FROM -- A 50 SEATS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, AND THE ELECTION IN GEORGIA COULD GIVE IT 51 SENATORS. HERE'S WHAT OBAMA SAID ABOUT THAT WHILE HE WAS CAMPAIGNING FOR THE REELECTION OF SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK IN GEORGIA.  AN EXTRA SENATOR GIVES DEMOCRATS MORE BREATHING ROOM ON IMPORTANT BILLS. IT PREVENTS ONE PERSON FROM HOLDING UP EVERYTHING. AND IT ALSO PUTS US IN A BETTER POSITION, A COUPLE OF YEARS FROM NOW WHEN YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER ELECTION BUT THE SENATE MATH IS GOING TO BE TILTED IN THE FAVOR OF REPUBLICANS. AND IT WILL HELP PREVENT REPUBLICANS FROM GETTING A FILIBUSTER APPROVED MAJORITY THAT COULD ALLOW THEM TO DO THINGS LIKE PASSING A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN.  JOINING US NOW IS DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MARK KELLY OF ARIZONA, SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. YOU JOINED US DURING THE CAMPAIGN AND IT IS A PLEASURE TO WELCOME YOU BACK TONIGHT AS A WINNER IN THE WINNERS CIRCLE. WHAT IS IT MEAN FOR ARIZONA THAT DEMOCRATS NOW DOMINATE STATEWIDE ELECTIVE OFFICE THERE.  HEY LAWRENCE, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AGAIN, IT IS NICE TO BE AFTER THE ELECTION. WE WILL FINISH THAT UP TOMORROW, I'VE GOT A LOT OF CONFIDENCE THAT SENATOR WARNOCK IS GOING TO WIN THIS ELECTION. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT HE DOES, FOR SOME OTHER REASONS, DOING HOPE THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW, IN ARIZONA, IF ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT CHOICES AND WHETHER IT IS OUR FUTURE GOVERNOR KATIE HOBBS OR THE SECRETARY OF STATE RACE, OR ONE THAT YOU DID NOT MENTION, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S RACE, IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT ARIZONA WANTED HARD WORKERS, COMPETENCE, AND THEY WANTED TO MOVE AWAY FROM STUFF THAT JUST IS NOT IMPORTANT FOR OUR STATE. DENYING THE 2020 ELECTION, THEY WANT FOLKS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON SOLVING THE PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE. THAT IS WHAT I'VE DONE OVER THE LAST TWO. YEARS  YOU'VE BEEN WORKING IN A 50/50 SENATE, WHICH I HAVE TO SAY, HAVING WORKED IN THE SENATE MYSELF, IT IS JUST UNIMAGINABLE TO ME. I DO NOT KNOW HOW YOU GUYS HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH IT. YOU ARE HOPING FOR 51, YOU MIGHT GET TO 51 TOMORROW NIGHT. WHAT DIFFERENCE WOULD 51 MAKE?  WELL LAWRENCE, LET ME ALSO SAY IT HAS BEEN 50 50 FOR TWO YEARS, BUT THAT IS FINE. I THINK THAT THE SENATE WORKS BEST WHEN WE ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO WORK ACROSS THE AISLE. REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS WORKING TOGETHER GET STUFF DONE, AND WE DID THAT ON VETERANS HEALTH CARE, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND ON THE CHIPS ACT. REALLY IMPORTANT PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT MOVES COUNTRY FORWARD. TOMORROW WE'VE GOT THIS ELECTION IN GEORGIA. LET ME TELL YOU WHY THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT, IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT NUMBERS. I MEAN, I'VE GOT HERE WITH SENATOR WARNOCK, I WORKED WITH HIM FOR TWO YEARS, HE HAS BEEN A PUBLIC SERVICE MOST OF HIS ADULT LIFE SERVING THE STATE OF GEORGIA. HE IS SMART, CAPABLE, HE IS DELIVERED FOR THE STATE OF GEORGIA AND THIS COUNTRY. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, SO I LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING ANOTHER TWO YEARS WITH HIM AFTER THE ELECTION TOMORROW.  OVER THE WEEKEND WE SAW THAT THE LAST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP, HAS CALLED FOR DETERMINATION OF THE CONSTITUTION. I WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT ONE REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF THE HOUSE, DAVID JOYCE, SAID TO GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS ABOUT THIS.  HE WOULD SUPPORT A CANDIDATE WHO IS FOR SUSPENDING THE CONSTITUTION?  HE SAYS A LOT OF, THINGS HAVE TAKEN IN CONTEXT.  SENATOR, WE HAVE SOME REPUBLICANS SAYING THAT THEY DISAGREE WITH DONALD TRUMP'S ADVOCATING TERMINATING THE CONSTITUTION. BUT WHEN YOU ASK THEM IF DONALD TRUMP IS THE ROBIN AMANI FOR PRESIDENT, WILL YOU VOTE FOR HIM, THEY ARE STILL WITH HIM.  WELL, THEY SHOULD NOT BE. WE SHOULD HAVE SOMEBODY IN THE HIGHEST OFFICE WHO DOES NOT BELIEVE IN THE CONSTITUTION AND THINKS IT SHOULD BE SUSPENDED SO THAT HE COULD BE APPOINTED. WE HAVE SEEN STUFF LIKE THIS BEFORE AND I THINK, IN THIS ELECTION, HERE IN 2022, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE MADE DECISIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT THAT DOES NOT WORK FOR THEM, AND WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT AND WHAT THEY WILL GET IN RACES IN ARIZONA, AND I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT IN GEORGIA TOMORROW, OUR INDIVIDUALS THAT BELIEVE IN THE CONSTITUTION, BELIEVE IN OUR COUNTRY, WANT A BETTER FUTURE FOR EVERYBODY, AND FOLKS THAT ARE JUST WILLING TO WORK HARD, BUT, THE DIVISIVENESS ASIDE, AND JUST DO WHAT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST FOR ALL OF US. FOR ME, THAT IS MORE OF THE SAME, IT IS MORE NOISE, AND IT HAS BEEN RESOUNDINGLY REJECTED BY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  IT IS HARD TO THINK OF A LESS QUALIFIED SENATE CANDIDATE THEN DONALD TRUMP'S CANDIDATE IN GEORGIA, HERSCHEL WALKER. IS IT YOUR SENSE THAT VOTERS ARE, IN RACES LIKE THIS, ARE NOT NECESSARILY JUST VOTING FOR THE DEMOCRAT, BUT THEY'RE ACTIVELY VOTING AGAINST THIS REPUBLICAN CHOICE?  I THINK IT IS DIFFERENT THINGS FOR DIFFERENT PEOPLE. I KNOW IN MY RACE IN ARIZONA I HAD WIDE SUPPORT FROM REPUBLICANS, REPUBLICAN MAYORS AND COUNTY SUPERVISORS, BUSINESS LEADERS, LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY WOULD COME UP TO ME FREQUENTLY BUT, ALSO ENDORSED ME. REPUBLICAN MAYORS BECAUSE THEY ARE TIRED OF WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS NOW. THEY JUST WANT TO GET THINGS DONE AND THEY JUST WANT THE NOISE TO BE IN THE PAST AND THEY WANT FOLKS THAT WILL FOCUS ON THE FUTURE I KNOW REVEREND WARNOCK WILL DO THAT, HE HAS DONE THAT FOR TWO YEARS HE IS SMART, CONFIDENT, AND HE'S DONE IT FOR TWO YEARS. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HIM WHEN HE GETS BACK UP HERE LATER THIS WEEK.  SENATOR MARK KELLY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US AGAIN TONIGHT.  ANY TIME LAWRENCE, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON.  THANK YOU. COMING UP, THE CHAIR OF THE GEORGIAN DEMOCRAT PARTY, CONGRESSMAN WILLIAMS WILL JOIN US ON THE NIGHT BEFORE GEORGIA'S BIG ELECTION DAY. THAT IS NEXT.

AND THOSE WERE SOME OF THE BIGGEST TOUCHDOWNS SCORED BY WINNING TEAMS ACROSS THE NFL YESTERDAY. SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL FEATURED THE COWBOYS HOSTING THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS. THE COWBOYS TURNED A CLOSE GAME INTO A BLOW OUT WITH 33 UNANSWERED POINTS SCORED IF THE FINAL QUARTER, LEADING BY JUST THREE, ENTERING THE FOURTH. QUARTERBACK DAK PRESCOTT TOSSED HIS THIRD TOUCHDOWN OF THE GAME AND FOUR DALLAS TAKE AWAYS ALL TURNED INTO TOUCHDOWNS. THE COWBOYS BEAT THE COLTS, 54-19. ELSEWHERE IN THE NFC EAST, THE NEW YORK GIANTS AND WASHINGTON COMMANDERS FINISHED IN A 20-20 TIE. THE GIANTS' PERFORMANCE MIGHT NOT LAND THEM ON THE LIST OF THE BIGGEST REASONS TO LOVE NEW YORK. LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE OTHER REASONS ARE AS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE NEW EDITION OF NEW YORK MAGAZINE, THE 18th ANNUAL REASONS TO LOVE NEW YORK ISSUE WITH THE OVER ARCHING THEME OF THE CITY'S COMEBACK FOLLOWING THE DEVASTATING COVID PANDEMIC. JOINING US NOW, EDITOR AND CHIEF OF NEW YORK MAGAZINE, DAVID HASKELL. WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER SINCE BEFORE COVID. I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE. WHAT'S TOPPING THE LIST OF THE REASONS TO LOVE NEW YORK.  THOUGH IN MANY WAYS, WE'RE A NATIONAL MAGAZINE. ONCE A YEAR WE DECIDE IN DECEMBER TO PUT THIS ISSUE OUT. IT'S A SPECIAL ISSUE. AN 18th EDITION. SOMEWHAT OF A LOVE LETTER TO THE CITY OR HOLIDAY CARD, AND A WAY TO LOOK BACK ON HOW THE CITY HAS FARED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. TWO YEARS AGO WE DID IT DIFFERENT. WE CALLED IT REASONS WE LOVE NEW YORK, AND IT WAS A VERY SOMBER WAKE BASICALLY FOR 500, WE TRACKED DOWN 500 BUSINESSES, RESTAURANTS, BARS, GYMS THAT HAD CLOSED THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC AND GAVE LITTLE TRIBUTES TO THEM. WE WERE MAKING THE ISSUE IN OUR BEDROOMS AND CLOSETS AND FIGURING OUR WAY THROUGH A COMPLETELY REMOTE CLOSE, AND IT SEEMED TO US THIS YEAR, A MARK OF HOW FAR WE ARE IN OUR EXPERIENCE IN THIS PANDEMIC THAT OVERWHELMING FEELING WAS OF BUSYNESS, JOSTLING, BUSTLING CITY, AND SO STARTING WITH THE COVER, IT'S SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO WRANGLE A CELEBRITY TO BE ON THE COVER BUT WE DECIDED TO DO HERE WAS TO INVITE 72 NOTABLE NEW YORKERS TO JOIN US ON THE COVER. AND THE CONCEPT WAS THE FEELING THAT FEELS SPECIFIC TO NEW YORK, WALKING DOWN THE STREET WITH A FRIEND AND CROSSING AN INTERSECTION, HEY, ISN'T THAT, AND MAYBE IT'S YOU OR MAYBE IT'S CHUCK SCHUMER. WE INVITED MANY PEOPLE TO AN INTERSECTION IN THE MEAT PACKING DISTRICT, AND A PHENOMENAL PHOTOGRAPHER STATIONED ABOVE ON THE HIGH LINE. HE SPENT THE DAY. THERE WERE BLACK CARS BRINGING IN ONE NEW YORKER AFTER ANOTHER. AND PHOTOGRAPHED THEM BOUNCING FROM ONE PART OF THE INTERSECTION TO THE OTHER. AND OUR DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY AND HER WHOLE TEAM WERE TRAFFIC POLICING, AND THE WAY THIS PHOTOGRAPHER WORKS, HE LAYERS IMAGES ON TOP OF OTHERS. THIS WAS SHOT SEVEN DAYS AGO, AND TOOK ABOUT SEVEN DAYS OF POST PRODUCTION WORK TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PLACING PAUL RUDD IN THE RIGHT SPOT, AND ALEX CASS AND SPIKE LEE IN THE RIGHT SPOT.  THERE'S AN INTERESTING TONE. I'M LOOKING AT SOME OF NEW YORK MAGAZINE'S TOP REASONS TO LOVE NEW YORK, FOR DISCUSSION, AND YOU WROTE WE STARTED TREATING THE SUBWAY LIKE OUR LIVING ROOM AGAIN. NO MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE, NEW YORKERS CAN HELP YOU GET AN ABORTION AND PAY FOR IT TOO.  IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT POLITICS AND SOCIAL ISSUES, AND THE ROLE THE CITY PLAYS IN THE NATIONAL CONTEXT. WE ARE OFTEN WRITING STORIES THAT ARE FAIRLY URGENT STORIES ABOUT IMMIGRATION AND SOCIAL ISSUES. GUY ISSUES, ABORTION ISSUES AND SO THE TWO THAT WERE THE MOST MOVING TO US THIS YEAR WERE THAT STORY OF HOW MEANINGFUL THE CITY HAS BEEN IN A NATIONAL CONTEXT FOR PEOPLE LOOKING TO GET AN ABORTION THAT COULDN'T GET IT ELSEWHERE AND THE AMOUNT OF GRASS ROOTS LOCAL SUPPORT TO HELP MAKE THAT HAPPEN, AND THERE'S A TOUCHING STORY ABOUT A WOMAN WHO HAS BEEN WORKING WITH BUSSED IN MIGRANTS AND HAVING NO IDEA WHERE TO GO, AND SHE HAS BEEN BASICALLY ADOPTING THEM INTO HER HOME, AND IT WAS JUST REALLY US AN INTERESTING SLICE OF LIFE. NOT JUST AT THE POLICY LEVEL BUT A KIND, DECENT NEW YORKER HELPING THEM GET A LEG UP ON A NEW CITY.  THIS IS THE 18th EDITION OF THE THIS LIST. IN ANY PREVIOUS YEAR, HAD YOU SAID THIS, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED INSANE, EVEN LAGUARDIA, TALK ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF THE AIRPORT, ALL NEW YORKERS HAVE LOVED TO HATE.  HAVE YOU BEEN?  IT'S NICER NOW IT'S PRETTY INTERESTING. I GUESS WE LANDED ON RITSY, GLAMOROUS FELT TOO MUCH. BUT SERVICEABLE.  AN UPGRADE FROM WHAT IT WAS.  YOU CAN MOVE AROUND IT PRETTY WELL.  IF YOU'RE USED TO THE OLD LAGUARDIA, IT'S SMALL.  IT WAS IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT JUST THE ENGINEERING MARVEL. THEY DIDN'T SHUT IT DOWN WHEN THEY BUILT ON TOP OF IT A NEW ONE.  THAT IS A MARVEL.  AND YOU CAN SEE DRIVING BY THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, IT WAS SORT OF LIKE WORKING IN GROUND ZERO KEEPING THE ONE TRAIN RUNNING. IT'S INCREDIBLE HOW THE CITY MANAGES PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS.  THIS STARTED IN 2005. RIGHT I WAS AT THE MAGAZINE THEN, AND PART OF THE REASON IT STARTED, IN SOME WAYS, A MAGAZINE FEATURE COULD BE A BIG SERVICE FEATURE. A LIST OF THINGS. BUT THE OTHER THING THAT WAS HAPPENING THEN, AND THIS LEADS TO MY QUESTION ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW, IT WAS VERY MUCH I THOUGHT WHEN IT WAS FIRST WHEN ADAM AND THE TEAM WHO WERE AROUND EVEN THEN THOUGHT THIS UP, IT WAS NEW YORK HAD GONE, COME THROUGH 9/11, AND THE NOTION OF THERE WAS A LARGER STORY BEHIND REASONS TO LOVE, WHICH WAS LIKE PEOPLE KIND OF THE CITY TEETERED AT 9/11, AND THEN THERE WAS THIS BURST OF ENERGY, AND SOME OF IT WAS THE RETURN OF FINANCE. SOME OF IT WAS THE LAKE SHORE EAST SIDE ROCK SCENE, MEET ME IN THE BATHROOM ERA. THE CITY'S COMEBACK WAS KIND OF ENCAPSULATED IN THAT. I WONDER, AS THE EDITOR OF A THING LIKE THIS. CLEVER, INTERESTING THINGS TO POINT OUT ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE CITY. IS THERE A BIGGER STORY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING TO NEW YORK IN THE POST PANDEMIC ERA. PEOPLE THOUGHT, NEW YORK COULD BE DEAD. WHAT DOES THIS ADD UP TO AND THE BIG THEME OF IT ALL.  IT STARTS RIGHT THERE, AND SAYS THAT THE CITY IS JUST SO FAR FROM DEAD. IT IS ALIVE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, THOUGH, IT REALLY DOES NOT LOOK LIKE MIKE BLOOM BERG CITY, AND I THINK WE MIGHT FIND IN A HISTORICAL WAY, DE BLASIO CITY WAS SORT OF A TRANSITION. WHAT WE LIVE IN RIGHT NOW IS A LITTLE BIT DIRTIER A LITTLE BIT MORE CONFUSING, YOU HAVE A SORT OF, YOU KNOW, HIGH ENERGY RAMBUNCTIOUS, HARD TO KEEP TRACK OF WHERE HIS HEAD IS AT MAYOR, A LOT OF SORT OF TAWDRY TABLOID SCANDALS. IT FEELS TO ME IN A LOT OF WAYS, A NEW YORK CITY I GREW UP IN, NOT THE ONE I SPENT MY CAREER EDITING IN. BUT TO ME, WHAT I THINK IS VALUABLE ABOUT TAKING STOCK IN A YEAR LIKE THIS, AND JUST SAY LOOK AROUND. IT'S, YOU KNOW, JUST ABSURD TO IMAGINE THE CITY HAD SOMEHOW FAILED TO SURVIVE THE PANDEMIC YEARS. IT WILL EVOLVE, AND JUST AS, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WE WILL NEVER BUILD SKYSCRAPERS AFTER 9/11, AND I FELT A LITTLE BIT OF THAT AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT MIDTOWN, AND YOU KNOW, OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME OFFICE JOBS THAT HAVE TURNED REMOTE OR HYBRID. YOU WALK AROUND THE BLOCKS WE'RE AT RIGHT NOW, AND IT'S JUST CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS IS A PLACE THAT MANY PEOPLE WANT TO BE, AND THAT PLAYS OUT IN REALLY KIND OF WEIRD AND OFTEN HIGH FRICTION WAYS, AND THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT NEW YORK'S ABOUT.  NEW YORK MAGAZINE'S 18th ANNUAL REASONS TO LOVE NEW YORK ISSUE IS OUT NOW. EDITOR-IN-CHIEF DAVID HASKELL. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE PRECOVID. > WE ARE LOOKING AT THE LEADERSHIP RACE FOR HOUSE REPUBLICANS AS A HANDFUL OF GOP MEMBERS ARE THREATENING TO BLOCK KEVIN McCARTHY'S BID TO BECOME SPEAKER.

ALSO, EXPLAIN THE 80-FOOT CHRISTMAS TREE OUTSIDE OF NBC.  THERE IS THAT. WELCOME BACK TO \"MORNING JOE.\" IT'S NICE. WE'LL GET INTO THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT.  WE ARE.  ARE WE? YEAH?

JONATHAN, REVEREND AL, JOHN. GEORGIA, EARLY RECORD VOTING IN THE RUNOFF. THE BATTLE BETWEEN INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT WARNOCK AND CHALLENGER WALKER WILL BE DECIDED TOMORROW. PETER ALEXANDER HAS THE LATEST.  Reporter: IN GEORGIA HOURS TO GO BEFORE THE NATION'S FINAL MIDTERM ELECTION.  ARE YOU READ TO WIN THIS ELECTION?  Reporter: WITH TWORM'S CRITICAL RUNOFF BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC SENATOR WARNOCK AND HIS REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER HERSCHEL WALKER.  GOT TO DO IT TOGETHER AND THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO WIN.  Reporter: NEITHER CANDIDATE REACHED THE THRESHOLD WITH WARNOCK WINNING BY 37,000 VOTES. OUT OF NEARLY 4 MILLION CAST. GEORGIANS SHATTERED EARLY VOTING RECORDS. INCLUDING MORE THAN 77,000 WHO DID NOT VOTE IN NOVEMBER'S CONTEST. IT IS A CHAOTIC CAMPAIGN WITH WALKER FACING NEW ALLEGATIONS OF DOMESTIC ABUSE. IN AN INTERVIEW SHERYL SAID SHE HAD A FIVE-YEAR RELATIONSHIP WITH WALKER ALLEGING HE ATTACKED HER IN 2005.  HAD HIS HAND ON MY THROAT AND CHEST AND THEN HE LEANED BACK TO THROW A PUNCH AND LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO AVOID THAT.  Reporter: ASKED WHY SHE DECIDED TO COME FORWARD NOW --  I HAVE TO SAY WHAT I KNOW. I HAVE TO TELL THE HERSCHEL I KNOW.  Reporter: NBC NEWS SPOKE WITH THREE INDIVIDUALS WHO SAY SHE TOLD THEM ABOUT THAT EPISODE IN THE PAST BEFORE WALKER WAS A CANDIDATE FOR SENATE. THE CAMPAIGN HAS NOT RESPONDED TO NBC NEWS'S REQUEST FOR COMMENT AND WALKER IGNORED QUESTIONS OVER THE WEEKEND BUT FACED OTHER DOMESTIC ABUSE ALLEGATIONS FROM EX-WIFE AND SON AND SAID HE THREATENED TO KILL THEM. THE CAMPAIGN DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS. WALKER ACKNOWLEDGED SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WARNOCK TRIED TO CAPITALIZE ON THE MOMENTUM WITH HIGH-PROFILE EVENTS APPEARING WITH FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA.  WE'LL BRING IT ON HOME. LET'S MAKE THIS HAPPEN, GEORGIA.  THAT WAS PETER ALEXANDER REPORTING. SO, JOHN HEILEMANN, THE EARLY VOTING LOOKS STRONG. HARD TO TELL WHICH WAY THIS WILL GO. IT SEEMS LIKE HERSCHEL WALKER AT LEAST MIGHT BE GROWING ON SOME PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA THAT HE IS UNFIT AND MIGHT BE CASES WHERE THEY CAN'T VOTE FOR HIM.  YEAH. WITHOUT PREDICTING, THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT WHEN NEVADA ENDED UP IN THE DEMOCRATIC HANDS AND THE SENATE GOT LOCKED IN FOR DEMOCRATS THAT THE CONCERN AND PEOPLE IN WARNOCK'S WORLD WAS THAT IF THE STAKES WERE NOT -- THE SENATE WAS NOT ON THE LINE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A PROBLEM WITH TURNOUT AND THE CHALLENGE HAS BEEN HOW DO WE MAKE SURE TO GET THE TURNOUT ESPECIALLY WITH BLACK VOTERS WITH DEMOCRATS HAVING CONTROL OF THE SENATE. WARNOCK CAMPAIGN TWO YEARS AGO AND A GOOD CAMPAIGN IN THIS PERIOD OF TRYING TO HAMMER THIS POINT ABOUT -- YOU WOULD THINK WE'RE LIKE WALKER IS NOT QUALIFIED BUT VOTERS I THINK SHRUGGED AND ASSUMED THAT SOMEHOW EITHER WOULD WIN AND THE STAKES ARE NO LONGER THE UNITED STATES SENATE PER SE BUT SOMEONE IN OFFICE WHO IS NOT QUALIFIED AND THE BIGGEST STAT THIS MORNING IS THAT IT IS NOT JUST THE DEMOCRATS OVERREPRESENTED IN THE EARLY VOTE BUT STATISTIC THAT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING OUT NOW AND PERSUADED BY THE WARNOCK CAMPAIGN. MAYBE NOT ALL OF THEM BUT THIS FOCUS ON THIS IS HOW BAD THIS GUY IS. ARE YOU GOING TO PUT HIM IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED. WE DON'T KNOW. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE TURNOUT ON ELECTION DAY BUT SEEMS LIKE A STRONG POSITION TO CLOSE THIS THING OUT.  REV, TALK TO ME ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTE IN GEORGIA. I FEEL LIKE EVEN WITH BIDEN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WAS LIKE LET'S LET THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA TELL AMERICA WHAT THEY THINK OF THE CANDIDATES AND WENT VERY DIFFERENTLY BUT THESE CANDIDATES COULD NOT BE MORE DIFFERENT. ONE WITH TWO FAR RIGHT WHITE GUYS NEXT TO HIM PROPPING HIM UP AND THEN YOU HAVE ANOTHER WHO'S VERY DIFFERENT.  NO. CLEARLY THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT BUT I THINK THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT WHAT THE WARNOCK CAMPAIGN DID AND THAT IS THEY LET HERSCHEL WALKER BE EXPOSED TO WHO AND WHAT HE WAS. ASIDE FROM THE SCANDALS, PUTT THAT ASIDE, JUST HIS INABILITY TO DEAL WITH ISSUES, ARTICULATE POLICY BECAME EMBARRASSING AND STAND HIM BETWEEN TWO VERY CONSERVATIVE WHITE GUYS AND CAN'T DELIVER A GOOD MESSAGE THERE WITH COACHING. I DO A SYNDICATED RADIO SHOW AND GET CALLS FROM GEORGIA.  YEAH. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING IT?  HEARING IT FROM THE GROUND. PEOPLE SAYING THIS IS EMBARRASSING. CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS MAN ON THE SENATE FLOOR? YES, WE DISAGREE WITH TIM SCOTT WHO'S A BLACK REPUBLICAN BUT AT LEAST HE IS SOMEBODY THAT FEEL UNDERSTANDS THE LEGISLATION AND UNDERSTANDS THE POLICY. YOU DON'T THINK HERSCHEL EVEN UNDERSTANDS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WE CAN'T AFFORD THIS. I'M GETTING THIS ALL OVER THE PLACE.  IF WALKER WERE TO LOSE, ANOTHER PIECE OF DAMAGE ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BY TRUMP.  LIKE YOU NEED MORE?  TRUMP IS SO UNPOPULAR IN GEORGIA HE WON'T CAMPAIGN THERE.  \"MORNING JOE\" REPORTER WENT TO ATLANTA OVER THE WEEKEND TO TALK ABOUT THE KEY ISSUES FOR THEM. TAKE A LOOK.  I FEEL LIKE MY VOTE COUNTS BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION.  50-50. SOMETIMES PEOPLE MAY FEEL LIKE THIS IS NEVER GOING TO CHANGE SO I DON'T WANT TO TRY TO CHANGE IT.  Reporter: DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR VOTE MAKES A DIFFERENCE?  I DEFINITELY DO.  PAST TWO ELECTION CYCLES AND SHOWS HOW CLOSE AND IMPORTANT MY VOTE DOES MATTER.  100 YEARS MY GRANDMOTHER COULD NOT VOTE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT VOTING IS A PRIVILEGE AND SOMETHING TO EXERCISE AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS.  Reporter: DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE VOTE COUNTS?  I THINK SO.  Reporter: WHAT ARE THE ISSUES YOU GO TO THE BALLOT BOX AND FIND IMPORTANT THAT AFFECT YOU AND THE COMMUNITY?  PEOPLE THAT HAS BEEN FALLING TO GUN VIOLENCE AND VICTIMS OF IT.  DUE TO VIOLENCE IN THE CITY.  Reporter: WHAT ARE THE ISSUES YOU FIND IMPORTANT?  WOMEN'S REPRODUCTION RIGHTS. AFFORDABLE HOUSING. STUDENT DEBT RELIEF. CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM.  RECESSION IS A FACTOR. I GO TO THE GROCERY STORE AND BUYING TEN ITEMS AND $150. THE MONEY WE MAKE ISN'T INCREASING BUT THE EXPENSES ARE. AND PEOPLE PUTTING THE GROCERIES ON PAYMENT PLANS. THAT'S INSANE.  THE WAY THAT POLICE TREAT MINORITIES.  WE BELIEVE LIKE FOR ME REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE IS A MOST -- AN ISSUE THAT DROVE ME OUT TO THE BALLOT AND THAT WAS A BORDERLINE ISSUE FOR SOME PEERS BUT LIKE GUNS AND THE ECONOMY IS STILL KIND OF MODERATE ON THE ISSUES.  AT THE TOP OF THE LIST I SAY A WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE.  Reporter: IS THAT WHY YOU'RE VOTING FOR?  ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S IN FRONT OF MY MIND. I THINK THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT THAT WOMEN SHOULD HAVE AND PROTECTED.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EVERY WOMAN REMAINS THEIR RIGHT TO ABORTIONS.  Reporter: WILL YOU VOTE IN THE RUNOFF?  I AM. THIS IS AN INTENSE ELECTION HERE AND I -- THIS ISN'T THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND KNOW ELECTRIC RAL COLLEGE INVOLVED SO EVERY VOTE DOES COUNT.  Reporter: WHAT CAN CANDIDATES BE DOING BETTER?  I THINK LIKE DOING WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING. COMING INTO AREAS, TALKING TO PEOPLE. LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT THEY ARE ABOUT. ANYTHING. I HAVEN'T SEEN A CANDIDATE EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN IN GEORGIA.  Reporter: NEVER SEEN A CANDIDATE.  LIKE COME TO A LOCAL PLACE AND DO A --  Reporter: YOU VOTED IN THE MIDTERMS?  YES.  Reporter: VOTED FOR WARNOCK?  YES.  Reporter: WHAT ABOUT THE GOVERNOR RACE?  ABRAMS.  Reporter: YOU SEEM EXCITED TO GO.  I AM.  Reporter: YOU ARE ACTIVE IN VOTING. PART OF AN ORGANIZATION THAT ACTUALLY GETS PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE. BUT DO YOU THINK THAT'S A SENTIMENT THAT PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY ALSO SHARE? LIKE, WILL PEOPLE AT YOUR SCHOOL, FRIENDS AND FAMILY GETTING EXCITED FOR THIS RUNOFF ELECTION? IS IT SOMETHING THEY FEEL LIKE IS IMPORTANT?  MY FRIENDS ARE VOTING AND INFORMED BE GOING IN THE PERIMETER OF THE GROUPS MEETING PEOPLE IN OTHER SOCIAL CIRCLES THERE ISN'T THAT PASSION. AS SOMEONE THAT'S BLACK AND QUEER THERE ARE NOT PEOPLE THAT I RELATE TO. PEOPLE LIKE WALKER'S PRO-LIFE PLANS MORE AND EMBOLDENED BY THE FAITH VIEWS.  IF YOU A DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, I NEVER PAID ATTENTION TO THE PARTIES. I REALLY WAS LIKE WHOEVER GOOD FIT FOR THE COUNTRY.  I FEEL LIKE I CAN DEFINITELY BE SWAYED WHY IT IS A CULTURE THING TO GO WITH WHAT WE USUALLY GO WITH. IF THERE'S SOMEONE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO MAKE A CHANGE I FEEL LIKE IT.  Reporter: WHILE THE YOUTH VOTE IN ATLANTA SWAYED LEFT THE VOTERS I SPOKE TO ARE MORE FOCUSED ON ISSUES THAN PARTY LINES.  THANK YOU. LET'S BRING IN DIRECTOR OF POLLS AT HARVARD AND AUTHOR OF \"FIGHT.\" AS WE FOCUS ON GEORGIA AND THIS RUNOFF ELECTION WHICH WILL BE DECIDED TOMORROW, YOU WRITE THAT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE STRESSED AND SICKENED BY THE THOUGHTS OF DEMOCRACY SLIPPING AWAY YOUNG AMERICANS ACROSS LINES BANDED TOGETHER TO HELP SAVE THE DEMOCRATS FROM WHAT MANY FORESAW AS A SIDIBLE MIDTERM DEFEAT. HAVE THEY TURNED OUT BEFORE TO THIS DEGREE? DO YOU FORESEE THE SAME THING HAPPENING IN GEORGIA?  THANK YOU. AN EXCELLENT PIECE BY DANIELLA. I THINK THE LESSON FROM THE PIECE AND FROM THE MIDTERMS A FEW WEEKS AGO IS THAT REPUBLICANS CAN WIN ELECTIONS WITHOUT TALKING TO YOUNG VOTERS. DEMOCRATS CAN'T WIN WITHOUT MOBILIZING YOUNG VOTERS. SO MUCH WAS ON THE LINE. WHEN WE HAD THE DIFFERENCE THAT YOUNG PEOPLE COULD SEE WITH TRUMP IN OFFICE. THAT WITH THE MOBILIZATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE AROUND PARKLAND. THAT CHANGED THE GAME. WE HAVE SEEN 2018, 2020. AND NOW THIS MIDTERM ELECTION TURNOUT WE HADN'T SEEN IN 40 OR 50 YEARS. THEY ARE TURNING OUT IN NUMBERS WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED ANYMORE BECAUSE IT'S A NEW ERA IN 2018.  THE ISSUES THAT WE SAW DANIELLA TALKING TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT, IT IS RIGHT -- THEIR LIVES. THE RIGHTS. THEIR FUTURE COMING TO CLIMATE CHANGE. ISSUES LIKE THAT SEEM TO BE ACTUALLY MOTIVATING THEM TO NOT ONLY GET TO THE POLLS IN A MAJOR ELECTION BUT TO KNOW THAT THE MIDTERMS EXIST AND ACT ON IT.  THERE'S A NEW SENSE -- THE FIRST FOCUS GROUP I DID THIS YEAR WITH THE HARVARD OPINION PROJECT INCLUDED A NUMBER OF YOUNG OF COLOR FROM GEORGIA COMPLAINING THAT GOVERNMENT WASN'T MOVING AS QUICKLY AS THEY WOULD LIKE. I SAID WHY VOTE? THEY SAID IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY. WE NEED TO VOTE. THE ONLY WAY TO CREATE CHANGE. WHAT WE FOUND IN THE HARVARD POLLING ON A NATIONAL BASIS AMONG YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICANS, YOUNG BLACKS BY 2 TO 1 MARGIN COMPARED TO WHITES THEY CARE ABOUT GUN CONTROL AND VIOLENCE AND STUDENT DEBT AND COST OF LIVING SO THE PIECE IS VERY MUCH A LINED WITH THE YOUTH ELECTORATE. I THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA SPEAKING IN GEORGIA ALSO ELEVATES THE MESSAGE IN TERMS OF THE SYSTEM CAN WORK. IF YOUNGER PEOPLE PARTICIPATE WE CAN FIND THE SOLUTIONS TO THE CHALLENGES THAT HAVE BEEN FACING YOUNG PEOPLE AND OF COURSE THE COMMUNITY FOR GENERATIONS.  I ALSO SAW IN THAT PIECE AND WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN SAYING SOMETHING REFLECTED THAT I HAVE BEEN WATCHING AND VOTING AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY IS THEY CARE ABOUT MORE THAN JUST RACIAL ISSUES BECAUSE IN THE PAST BLACK VOTERS SAY I CARE ABOUT THIS, THAT AND THE OTHER. CONTINUED INEQUALITY. YOUNG VOTERS CARE ABOUT CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND CRIME AND GUN VIOLENCE AND INFLATION AND I THINK THAT IT IS EVOLVING OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY THAT WE CAN TALK IN A POST OBAMA ERA WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A BROAD ARRAY OF ISSUES AND TALK AS AMERICANS AND COMING THROUGH WITH THE GEN-Z AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY.  I THINK SO. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES ME SO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THIS COUNTRY IS ESPECIALLY BLACK FOLKS AND YOUNG PEOPLE AND HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AROUND ATLANTA VOTING FOR THEMSELVES AND THOSE VULNERABLE THAN THEMSELVES. THE YOUNG MAN TO PROTECT A WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. THE YOUNG WOMEN VOTING BECAUSE THE GRANDMOTHERS DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT A COUPLE GENERATIONS AGO. THAT'S EMBLEMATIC OF GEN-Z.  DIRECTOR OF POLLINGAL HARVARD INSTITUTE OF POLITICS, THANK YOU. WE'LL HAVE YOU BACK TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN GEORGIA COMING DOWN TO THE WIRE. JOINING US IS CONGRESSMAN PETE AGUILAR OF CALIFORNIA ELECTED BY THE COLLEAGUES LAST WOO EK TO SERVE IN THE NEXT CONGRESS AS CHAIR OF THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS. THE PARTY'S NUMBER THREE POSITION. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE NEW POSITION. JONATHAN LEMIRE HAS THE FIRST QUESTION FOR YOU.  GOOD MORNING. THE NEW ROLE AND THE NEW CONGRESS, LET'S START WITH A VERY BUSY LAME DECK SESSION FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. TALK ABOUT THE PRIORITIES HERE PARTICULARLY ON FUNDING FOR COVID. THE WHITE HOUSE HAS A $10 BILLION PUBLIC HEALTH REQUEST AND AID TO UKRAINE BEFORE THE REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL.  THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN. THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PRIORITY FOR DECEMBER. WE NEED TO WORK WITH REASONABLE REPUBLICANS TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT. THAT'S WHAT WE CAN AND SHOULD DO. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE WORKED ON FOR MONTHS. CHAIR ROSA DELORA DID AN AMAZING JOB BUT NOW WE NEED ACTION AND REPUBLICANS TO WORK TO SET A TOP LINE NUMBER WITH US IN THE SENATE BUT WE NEED TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS WHICH INCLUDES AS YOU MENTIONED COVID RELIEF DOLLARS AS WELL AS UKRAINE AID. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE AND TIME AND TIME AGAIN WHAT WE HAVE HEARD RECENTLY WHERE REPUBLICANS WANT TO CONDITION UKRAINE AID. WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STAND UP TO THE AUTHORITARIANISM OF RUSSIA AND MAKE SURE THAT UKRAINE HAS THE RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED.  ABOUT THE UKRAINE AID WE DID HEAR FROM KEVIN McCARTHY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO LONGER A BLANK CHECK FOR THE UNITED STATES TO KYIV AS A TERRIBLE WINTER SETS IN THERE AND CIVILIANS SUFFERING SO GREATLY. HOW WILL YOU PUSH FOR FUNDING THAT KYIV SAYS THEY NEED?  OVER $30 BILLION IN AID THAT THE ADMINISTRATION REQUESTED THIS MONTH. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THAT BECOMES A PRIORITY AND MEMBERS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS. HE HAS HIS FAR FLANK THAT IS TELLING HIM NO NEVER AND WON'T HELP UKRAINE. MAYBE BECAUSE THEY ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE RUSSIANS. I DON'T KNOW. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS WORK DONE THIS MONTH WORKING WITH REASONABLE REPUBLICANS. IF WE CAN FIND THEM WE'LL WORK WITH THEM ON FUNDING GOVERNMENT, MACKING SURE THAT UKRAINE HAS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED.  THIS IS JOHN HEILEMANN. CONGRATULATIONS. ONE OF THE THINGS HAPPENING IN AS WE HEADED TO ELECTION DAY AND THE MIDTERMS WAS MOUNTING CONCERN AMONG DEMOCRATS ABOUT SLIPPAGE WITH LATINO VOTERS. I'M CURIOUS WHAT YOU THINK IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE ELECTION WHAT THE STATE OF THE PARTY IS IN CONNECTION TO THAT VERY IMPORTANT CONSTITUENCY AND WHAT YOUR APPOINTMENT AND ELECTION SIGNALS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT CONSTITUENCY TO THE PARTY AND TO LATINOS TO HAVE YOU IN THERE.  FROM AN ELECTORAL PERSPECTIVE WE HAD AMAZING SUCCESS AND GROUNDED IN THE REALITY THAT HOUSE DEMOCRATS UNDERSTAND LATINO COMMUNITY IS NOT A MONOLITH. YOU CAN'T USE THE SAME TALKING POINTS BUT THE POLITICAL SUCCESS WAS INCREDIBLY NOTEWORTHY. WE HAVE NEW MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ELECTED IN WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE RED WAVE IN SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO. THESE ARE NEW MEMBERS. NEW MEMBERS IN AREAS WHERE LATINOS HAVE NOT HAD REPRESENTATION AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. HONORED TO HAVE THEM COME HERE AND WORK WITH US AS COLLEAGUES. BROADLY MY STORY IS VERY SIMILAR TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. MY PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS GREW UP HERE. MY DAD SHINED SHOES AS A KID. SNEAKING OUT OF THE HOUSE ON ROUTE 66 DOWNTOWN SAN BERNARDINO AND SHINING SHOES FOR A COUPLE EXTRA BUCKS. HE PUT HIMSELF -- WORKED ALMOST 40 YEARS FOR A LOCAL UTILITY. THAT'S THE AMERICAN DREAM. MY SHOES CAN WALK IN THE HALLS OF CONGRESS. THAT'S THE STORY OF THIS COUNTRY AND NOT UNIQUE TO THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORKING HARD SO THE KIDS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY BEHIND THEM.  CONGRESSMAN PETE AGUILAR OF CALIFORNIA, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING ON THIS MORNING. WE APPRECIATE IT. > MORE ON THE FALLOUT OF DONALD TRUMP CALLING TO TERMINATE THE CONSTITUTION. \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" RUTH MARCUS SAY IT IS COMMENTS ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO IGNORE.

        "trs": "BREAKING NEWS, TODAY GEORGIA SET A NEW RECORD FOR SINGLE DAY EARLY VOTING. MORE THAN 350,000 PEOPLE VOTED TODAY ON THE FINAL DAY OF EARLY VOTING FOR TUESDAY'S SENATE RUNOFF ELECTION, ACCORDING TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE. MEANWHILE, DEMOCRATS HAVE ALREADY WON CONTROL OF THE SENATE, THE STATES ARE STILL VERY HIGH AS THE FORMER PRESIDENT LAID OUT LAST NIGHT IN ATLANTA.  SOME FOLKS ARE ASKING, IF DEMOCRATS ALREADY HAD CONTROL OF THE SENATE WHY DOES THIS MATTER? WHAT DOES IT, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 50 AND 51? THE ANSWER IS A LOT. LET ME BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU, AN EXTRA SENATOR GIVES DEMOCRATS MORE BREATHING ROOM ON IMPORTANT BILLS. IT PREVENTS ONE PERSON FROM HOLDING UP EVERYTHING. AND IT ALSO PUTS US IN A BETTER POSITION A COUPLE OF YEARS FROM NOW, WHEN YOU'VE GOT ANOTHER ELECTION, BUT ON THE SENATE MAP IS GOING TO BE TILTED IN THE FAVOR OF REPUBLICANS. AND, IT WILL HELP REPUBLICANS FROM GETTING A FILIBUSTER APPROVE MAJORITY THAT COULD ALLOW THEM TO DO THINGS LIKE PASSING A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN. SO, THAT ONE VOTE, IN THE SENATE COULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE IS ONE MORE REASON. AND IT IS THE BIGGEST REASON. 51 IS BETTER THAN 50 BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT REVEREND WARNOCK WILL KEEP REPRESENTING YOU IN WASHINGTON. THAT IS THE BEST REASON. THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE REASON. HE WAS WONDERING IF I WAS GOING TO GET TO THAT, COME ON REVEREND YOU KNOW I HAVE YOUR BACK. SINCE THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE, SINCE THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE, MISTER WALKER HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT ISSUES THAT ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA. LIKE WHETHER IT IS BE A VAMPIRE OR A WEREWOLF. THIS IS A DEBATE THAT I MUST CONFESS I ONCE HAD MYSELF. WHEN I WAS SEVEN. THEN I GREW UP. IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING BY THE WAY, MR. WALKER DECIDED THAT HE WANTED TO BE A WEREWOLF, WHICH IS GREAT. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, HE CAN BE ANYTHING HE WANTS TO BE, EXCEPT FOR A UNITED STATES SENATOR.  WORD. THAT IS ONE PROMINENT GEORGIA REPUBLICAN WHO COULD NOT BRING HIMSELF TO VOTE FOR THE WEARABLES GUY, AND HE IS SPEAKING VERY PUBLICLY ABOUT IT.  I SHOWED UP TO VOTE THIS MORNING, I WAS ONE OF THE FOLKS WHO GOT IN LINE AND SPENT ABOUT AN HOUR WAITING AND IT WAS THE MOST DISAPPOINTING BALLOT I'VE EVER STARED AT IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. AND SO I WALKED OUT OF THAT BALLOT BOX, SHOWING UP TO VOTE, BUT NOT VOTING FOR EITHER ONE OF THEM.  THE REPUBLICAN LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TOLD THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION THAT LIKE MANY CONSERVATIVES ACROSS GEORGIA, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR HERSCHEL WALKER TO GIVE ME A REASON TO SUPPORT. HIM REGRETTABLY, HE HAS NOT AND THAT IS WHY I WAS FORCED TO LEAVE MY BALLOT BLANK. THAT MAKES IT A LITTLE AWKWARD FOR THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA, BRIAN KEMP, WHO'S RE-ROBUSTLY CAMPAIGNED FOR HERSCHEL WALKER AND POSSIBLY FOR THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS FROM THE SOUTH WHO HAVE APPEARED WITH HERSCHEL WALKER NEARLY EVERY SINGLE TIME WALKER HAS SET AN INTERVIEW ON FOX, WHICH ONE MEDIA REPORTER DESCRIBED AS DEEPLY WEIRD. PRESIDENT BIDEN DID SOME PHONE BANKING FOR SENATOR WARNOCK THIS AFTERNOON AND SAID THIS.  THIS IS NOT A REFERENDUM ON WARNOCK, THIS IS A CHOICE. A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO MEN, ONE MAN WHO DOES NOT DESERVE TO BE IN THE UNITED STATES SENATOR. THERE ARE LOTS OF TIME WHEN BOTH NOMINEES DESERVE IT, ONE IS JUST BETTER THAN THE OTHER. ONE DOES NOT DESERVE PERIOD STATE SENATOR BASED ON HIS FEROCITY AND WHAT HE SAID. THE OTHER MAN IS A TRULY, DECENT, HONORABLE GUY. JOINING US NOW IS CRAIG, A REPORTER FOR THE ATLANTA CONSTITUTION AND THE AUTHOR OF FLIPPED. AND EUGENE ROBINSON, PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING COLUMNIST FOR THE WASHINGTON POST. THEY ARE BOTH MSNBC POLITICAL CONTENDER YEARS. GREG, YOU INTERVIEWED THE REPUBLICAN LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. HE SAID PUBLICLY, BUT WHAT ARE REPUBLICANS SAYING PRIVATELY?  WHILE THEY ARE REALLY WORRIED THAT OF HERSCHEL WALKER'S CHANCES RIGHT, NOW AND THEY'RE WORRIED THAT HE BASICALLY WENT AM I A ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL OVER THE THANKSGIVING BREAK, AT THE SAME TIME THAT WARNOCK WAS HAVING MORE THAN A DOZEN EVENTS, TRYING TO MOBILIZE VOTERS TO THE POLL. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THAT RHETORIC, AND THE VAMPIRES, WEREWOLVES, AND A LOT MORE THAN THAT. THEY ARE WORRIED HE IS MISSING HIS CHANCE TO APPEAL TO THOSE SWING TICKET VOTERS, THE VOTERS TO SPLIT THEIR BALLOTS BETWEEN WARNOCK AND CAMP, MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD INDEPENDENTS AT THE TIME WHEN THEY NEED TO GET THOSE VOTERS BACK IN THE GOP FOLDS. SO REPUBLICANS ARE VERY CONCERNED RIGHT NOW.  AND A QUICK FOLLOW-UP GREG, HAVE THE CONTROVERSY OF WALKER'S TAXES PALM HAD ANY IMPACT ON THE RACE?  I THINK THAT JUST BECOMES ANOTHER MOBILIZING FACTOR FOR DEMOCRATS. IT IS NOT NEW, HE ACTUALLY REGISTER TO VOTE JUST DAYS BEFORE HE FORMALLY ANNOUNCED HIS BID FOR THE U.S. SENATE, BACK IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR. WE HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON THOSE ISSUES IN THE RUN UP TO HIM, ANNOUNCING HIS CANDIDACY. IT IS WELL-KNOWN IN GEORGIA THAT HE HAS NOT LIVED IN GEORGIA FOR DECADES. BUT IT ALLOWS US TO PAINT HIM AS AN OUT OF STATE CARPETBAGGER RIGHT NOW. YOU  EUGENE, DO YOU THINK THAT THE -- CREATES ADMISSION STRUCTURE FOR REPUBLICANS TO SET THIS ONE OUT?  I THINK THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT WHY ELSE WOULD HE COME OUT AND ANNOUNCE THAT I, A LOYAL CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN, COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO VOTE FOR THIS MAN? WE WILL SEE HOW MANY GEORGIA REPUBLICANS WILL WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR. LOOK, GREG BLUESTEIN IS THE AUTHORITY ON GEORGIA POLITICS, I WOULD NEVER QUESTION ANYTHING HAS TO SAY. BUT, IT WAS HERSCHEL WALKER BEING OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, A NEGATIVE FOR HIM OR A NET POSITIVE?  THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION.  HE IS TALKING ABOUT VAMPIRES AND WEREWOLVES. SO THIS SEEMS TO BE TO BE A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD, MAYBE SOME PEOPLE ON THE CAMPAIGN THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO KEEP HIM IN THE CLOSET AND WORK ON THE TURNOUT MACHINE, AND SEE IF THEY COULD KIND OF DRAG HIM INTO THE MIDDLE.  GREG ANSWER JEAN'S QUESTION, BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD ONE. DID SOMEBODY SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, IT IS PROBABLY BETTER FOR YOU TO STAY OFF THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL?  YEAH, THAT IS REALLY FAIR POINT AND IT CERTAINLY IS PART OF THE STRATEGY EARLIER ON THE CAMPAIGN. VERY FEW EVENTS, VERY TIGHTLY ORGANIZED, SCRIPTED, AND NO MEDIA ACCESS TO MANY OF HIS EARLY EVENTS. BUT, AS OF THIS MOMENT, RIGHT NOW THIS PAST WEEKEND YOU HAVE HAD SATURDAY VOTING AND SUNDAY VOTING WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO CAST THEIR BALLOTS. 100,000 OVERALL DEMOCRATS HAD THE FEEL TO THEMSELVES, SO I TALK TO A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WHO WERE BAFFLED THAT HERSCHEL WALKER WAS NOT INTO EXCERPTS, POT REPUBLICAN FRIENDLY TERRITORIES, URGING PEOPLE TO CAST A BALLOT EARLY. THEY FEEL LIKE THEY BANKED REALLY EARLY CUSHION OF TIME WHEN REPUBLICANS WERE KIND OF LEADING THE FIELD TO THEMSELVES.  YOU KNOW, EUGENE, WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME, BUT I WOULD WANT TO BE A VERY -- DANTE SEWARD SAYS THAT, HE WRITES THE BEGINNING, HOW THE HECK DID WE GET HERE? I AGREE WITH THE FACT THAT SOMEONE LIKE MR. WALKER ACTUALLY HAS A CHANCE AT A RUNOFF AGAINST THE INCUMBENT SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK. WHAT DOES IT COST US AS BLACK PEOPLE TO SEE THIS PLAY OUT PUBLICLY? WHAT DOES IT COST THIS COUNTRY? I WANT TO SKIP ALL THE WAY TOWARDS THE END WHERE HE ENDS AND SAYING, POLITICS ASIDE, POSITIONS ASIDE, I HAVE TO WONDER WHAT IS IT THAT SO MANY WHITE PEOPLE SEE AS DESIRABLE IN HERSCHEL WALKER? LOVE YOUR REACTION TO THAT, EUGENE.  I READ THE PIECE, ACTUALLY, AND I THOUGHT IT WAS A POWERFUL PIECE. I CANNOT ANSWER THE QUESTION, THE PIECE ATTEMPTED TO GIVE SOME ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS THAT PEOPLE SEE. SIMPLY NOT QUALIFIED TO BE A U.S. SENATOR. I AM READING THE PIECE REMINDED ME OF WHAT MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO SAY WHEN I WAS GROWING UP A LONG TIME AGO, WHICH IS TO -- A BLACK MAN IN THIS COUNTRY HAS TO BE TWICE AS GOOD TO RUN. AND THAT SEEMS TO APPLY TO REVEREND WARNOCK, BUT NOT HERSCHEL WALKER. THERE IS A DISCONNECT THERE, I AM NOT SURE I FULLY UNDERSTAND.  I THINK, WE WILL HAVE TO DO A WHOLE BLOCK JUST ON TALKING ABOUT, ANSWERING THOSE QUESTIONS. JEAN ROBINSON, COME ON MAN, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW WHAT THE APPEAL IS. WE DO NOT HAVE TO TALK ABOUT. IT  OKAY, WE ARE GOING TO DO A BLOCK ON THIS. YOU WANT TO GO THERE, WE WILL GO THERE. BUT IT WILL TAKE A WHILE.  ALL RIGHT, YOU HEAR THAT CONTROL ROOM. JEANNE AND I ARE COMING BACK. THANK YOU BOTH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. COMING UP, IT HAS BEEN A BUSY DAY AT A FEDERAL GRAND JURY, NOW UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL, JACK SMITH. THAT IS NEXT.

JUST THREE WEEKS AGO, JASMINE CROCKETT SAID THIS WHEN SHE WAS ELECTED TO HER FIRST TERM IN THE UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.  I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I CAN BE -- SO THAT THOSE WHO NEED JOBS CAN GET GOOD PAYING JOBS, OUTSIDE OF LEGISLATION, I STILL HAVE WORK TO DO. I CANNOT CONTROL WHO IS GOING TO BE IN THE HOUSE, BUT I TRIED. YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY I SAND HOPING THAT THEY PULL THROUGH THESE RACES. BUT I AM GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM LISTENING TO THE NEEDS OF EVERYBODY.  CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT JASMINE CALK IT WON BIG ON ELECTION NIGHT, DEFEATING HER REPUBLICAN OPPONENT BY, GET THIS, 53 POINTS. THIS WEEK JASMINE CROCKETT WAS JAWING AS THE FRESHMAN REPRESENTATIVE OF LEADING THE INCOMING CLASS OF AT LEAST 35 DEMOCRATS. SHE IS THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN IN HISTORY TO HOLD THE POSITION. JASMINE CROCKETT IS NO STRANGER OF WORKING IN THE LEGISLATIVE FROM A POSITION OF THE MINORITY. SHE TURNED ONE TERM IN THE TEXAS HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WHERE SHE BATTLED REPUBLICANS ON ISSUES RANGING FROM ABORTION TO GUN CONTROL. WHEN SHE TAKES THE OATH OF OFFICE NEXT MONTH IN A REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED HOUSE, CONGRESSWOMAN CROCKETT WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR AND LISTEN TO THE NEEDS OF EVERYONE. JOINING ME NOW IS FRESHMAN CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT JASMINE CROCKETT OF TEXAS, THE NEWLY CHOSEN DEMOCRATIC FRESHMAN LEADERSHIP REPRESENTATIVE. WELCOME CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT.  HEY JONATHAN, IT IS GOOD TO SEE.  YOU GREAT TO SEE YOU TOO. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IS MOST IMPORTANT TO REPRESENT FROM THIS INCOMING FRESHMAN CLASS?  ABSOLUTELY, SO I AM SO IMPORTANT -- I AM SO EXCITED ABOUT OUR CLASS, I MIGHT BE A LITTLE IT IS AMAZING, CLASS THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN COME INTO CONGRESS, SO THAT IS NUMBER ONE. I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM LISTENING TO EVERYONE, AND WHEN I TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY I'M TALKING ABOUT, OUR FRESHMAN PRESIDENT, ROBERT GARCIA, HE IS THE FIRST LGBTQ PRESIDENT THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD. AND SO, HE IS OUT IN LONG BEACH CALIFORNIA, AND A PRETTY SAFE BLUE SEAT. WE ALSO HAVE AMAZING ROCK STARS LIKE AMELIA SYKES WHO IS IN OHIO. SHE HAS BEEN A MINORITY LEADER IN THE STATE LEGISLATOR FOR OHIO, BUT SHE HAD A VERY TOUGH RACE. UNFORTUNATELY, OHIO HAS TO GO THROUGH REDISTRICTING AGAIN. WE ARE GOING TO SEE A SIMILAR SITUATION IN NORTH CAROLINA, WHERE WE HAVE FOUR NEW INCOMING FRESHMAN IN NORTH CAROLINA. NORTH CAROLINA IS NOT REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THAT, SO THEY WANT TO RE-DISTRICT AND GERRYMANDER EVEN MORE. SO WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE HAVING REAL CONVERSATION WITH LEADERSHIP, AND GIVING PRUSSIAN OPPORTUNITY WHERE THEY CAN SHINE, AND LIKE I DID WHEN I WAS IN MY FRESHMAN TERM, TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL AND THAT THEIR CONSTITUENCY KNOWS THAT THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR THEM, WHATEVER THEIR ISSUES MAY BE.  HOW DO YOU PLAN TO BALANCE YOUR OWN LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND WHAT YOU CAN GET DONE WITH THE REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED CONGRESS?  SO WE HAVE A FEW OPPORTUNITIES RIGHT NOW. OBVIOUSLY I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I AM TAKING MONEY HOME TO MY DISTRICT. I HAVE A DISTRICT THAT IS ALMOST AT A 20% POVERTY RATE, NOT QUITE BUT IT IS CLOSE TO IT. WE ALSO HAVE A LARGE UNHOUSED POPULATION, SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M GETTING FEDERAL DOLLARS AND THEY ARE COMING HOME. I ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE AMAZING. ONE OF THE COMMITTEES THAT I AM SHOOTING FOR'S FINANCIAL SERVICES. IT WILL ALSO OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO FIGHT FOR THOSE BREAD AND BUTTER ISSUES THAT ARE SO CRUCIAL IN MY DISTRICT, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE ARE ENTERING, STILL, THE ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS THAT I ATTRIBUTE A LOT TO THE PANDEMIC. WE ALSO HAVE SOME CORPORATE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT. BUT LET ME TALK ABOUT THIS, JOHNSON, LET'S BE REAL. WE KNOW THAT THE REPUBLICANS ARE IN DISARRAY RIGHT NOW. THEY CANNOT PICK A SPEAKER, THEY HAVE A MAJORITY AND THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. BUT WE ARE MORE UNIFIED THAN EVER. I WAS SO EXCITED, MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT I COME FROM A BIT OF A MORE PROGRESSIVE SIDE OF THE AISLE, BUT I AM UNIFIED, WE ARE UNIFIED IN MY CLASS. IT DID NOT MATTER, REALLY, WHAT TYPE OF DEMOCRAT YOU ARE. WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO SEE IN THIS HOUSE IS A UNIFIED DEMOCRATIC HOUSE.  WELL, I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THAT ALL PROGRESSES -- CONGRESSWOMAN IT IS SO LIGHT. CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT, JASMINE CROCKETT, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.  THE ABSOLUTELY, THANK YOU.  COMING UP, BUT I HAVE THE SENATE PASSED FOR THIS WEEK, AND I HAVE REPUBLICANS JOINING THE 21ST SENATE TREE AND HOPING TO PASS. IT BUT SERIOUSLY?

        "trs": " THE GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFF ELECTION -- IS JUST FIVE DAYS AWAY. IF YOU ARE THE WALKER CAMP, THAT CAN'T COME FAST ENOUGH. IT SEEMS EACH AND EVERY DAY BRINGS NEW PIECES OF NEWS. DEMONSTRATING JUST WHAT A TERRIBLE CAT MISTER WALKER. AS TONIGHT, FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WAS IN GEORGIA, AT A RALLY FOR WARNOCK. AND IT WASN'T PRETTY FOR HERSCHEL WALKER.  SINCE THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE -- SINCE THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE, MISTER WALKER HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT ISSUES. THAT ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA. LIKE, WHETHER IT'S BETTER TO BE A VAMPIRE OR WHERE ALL OF. YEAH THIS IS A DEBATE, BUT I MUST COME FAST, I WAS HURT -- MYSELF. BUT WHEN I WAS SEVEN.  WHEN I GREW UP. IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING, BY THE WAY, MR. WALKER DECIDED HE WANTED TO BE AWARE OF. WHICH IS GREAT, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, HE CAN BE ANYTHING HE WANTS TO PAY. AND STEP FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATOR. SINCE THE LAST TIME, SINCE THE LAST TIME I WAS, HERE HE ALSO CLAIMED THAT HE USED TO LET ME BEAT HIM AT BASKETBALL. BUT THEN HE ADMITTED, THAT WE'VE NEVER ACTUALLY MATH. SO, I GUESS THIS WAS MORE OF AN IMAGINARY WHIPPING, THAT I LAY IT ON HIM. WE NOW LISTEN, THIS WOULD BE FUNNY IF HE WEREN'T RUNNING FOR SENATE.  THAT'S WELL SAID, I THOUGHT THAT MANY TIME. IT'S THE REALITY OF THE SITUATION. IT ISN'T ONLY DEMOCRATS. LISTEN TO THE STORY TOLD BY THE REPUBLICAN LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA YESTERDAY.  I SHOWED UP TO VOTE THIS MORNING, I WAS ONE OF THOSE FOLKS THAT GOT IN LINE, SPENT AN HOUR WAITING, AND IT'S ONE OF THE MOST DISAPPOINTING BALLOT OF OUR STARED OFF OF MY TIRE LIFE. SINCE I STARTED VOTING. I HAD TWO CANDIDATES THAT COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING THAT MADE SENSE TO PUT MY VOTE BEHIND. I WALKED OUT OF THAT BALLOT BOX SHOWING UP TO ABOUT, BUT NOT VOTING FOR EITHER ONE OF THEM.  IT'S NOT SO SURPRISING, A STORY GIVEN THAT THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN, THERE SEEMS TO HAVE A NEW BOMBSHELL ABOUT HERSCHEL WALKER. CNN REPORTED THAT -- HIS PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE. AS RECENTLY AS THIS YEAR. THE DAILY BEAST REVEALED THAT PLACED WALKER SO-CALLED HOME IN GEORGIA, WAS RENTED OUT AS RECENTLY AS LAST YEAR. TODAY, ANOTHER EXPLOSIVE PORT BY THE DAILY BEAST. A FORMER LONGTIME GIRLFRIEND, COMING FOR WITH A POWERING DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THEIR FIVE-YEAR RELATIONSHIP. INCLUDING QUOTE, VIOLENT EPISODE WITH FOOTBALL STAR. SHE BELIEVES IT'S UNSTABLE, LITTLE TO NO CONTROL OVER HIS UNTIL -- WHEN HE'S NOT IN TREATMENT. HERSCHEL WALKER BLANKET DENIES EVERY ONE OF THE STORIES. NOTABLY, NEVER -- DISPUTES THE FACTS. ROGER SOLEMN BURGER IS A POLITICAL REPORTER WITH THE DAILY BEAST WHO BROKE THAT STORY, WITH OTHER STORIES -- DURING THE CAMPAIGN. HILLARY HOLLEY, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF -- MOBILIZING VOTERS FOR THE RUNOFF. AND BOTH JOIN ME NOW. HILLARY, LET ME START WITH YOU ABOUT THAT MOBILIZATION. WE'VE SEEN HUGE EARLY VOTING NUMBERS, RECORD SETTING. THERE IS THIS GENERAL UP SEPARATION, WHILE BIG TURNOUTS GOOD FOR DEMOCRATS. THIS WAS INTERESTING FROM THE ATLANTIC JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION. THE FIRST DAY -- HUNDRED 59 COUNTIES. WAS IN LIGHTLY POPULATED RURAL COUNTY. IS THAT HE CARRIED IN THE MID TERM. AMONG THE COUNTIES THAT BACKED U.S. SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK, 478,000 PEOPLE HAD VOTED THROUGH TUESDAY. -- IT'S ALWAYS HARD TO DROP CONCLUSIONS. WHAT'S YOUR SENSE ABOUT THE LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THIS RACE WILL DECIDE SENATE CONTROL AS SOME THOUGHT IT MIGHT?  YES, I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME THIS EVENING. I WILL SAY THIS, OVER THE WEEKEND, THIS PAST WEEKEND WHERE IT -- SO HARD TO GET. THE REPUBLICANS TRY TO BAN SATURDAY VOTING. BECAUSE OF THE -- LAWSUIT, WE WERE ABLE TO GIVE SATURDAY VOTING. OVER THAT TIME, WE HAD OVER 70,000 PEOPLE VOTE. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN, OVER THE PAST WEEK, IS WE'VE SEEN HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS. WE'RE AVERAGING OVER 250,000 VOTERS EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND THE REASON, BECAUSE OF, THAT IS WE HAVE CANVASSERS SUCH AS KAREN ACTION, BLACK VOTERS MATTER, IS THE LABEL ORGANIZATION UNITE HERE. WE COLLECTIVELY ARE KNOCKING OVER 200,000 DOORS A DAY. WE HAVE KNOCKED OVER 3 MILLION DOORS SO FAR. SO, WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THE TURNOUT, CHRIS. I'M LOOKING AT OUR VOTERS THAT ARE SHOWING UP. AND AS YOU JUST SAW, WE HAVE REPUBLICAN VOTERS WHO ARE VOTING FOR WARNOCK. --  YEAH, THAT LAST POINT IS IMPORTANT I THINK. ONE OF THE THINGS WE SAW WHEN THE ELECTORATE AS A WHOLE, IN THE MIDTERM ELECTION. WAS SLIGHTLY MORE REPUBLICAN IDENTIFY THAN THE 2020 ELECTORATE. THAT SHOWED UP IN WHICH BIDEN CARRIED THE STATES. THE REPUBLICAN VOTING FOR WARNOCK, WE KNOW THAT. THE MATH WOULDN'T HAVE SCANNED OTHERWISE. ROGER, WERE STRUCK BY YOUR STORY TODAY BECAUSE IT SEEMS AS THOUGH IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. I REMEMBER WHEN DONALD TRUMP PICKED HERSCHEL WALKER AS HE CLEARLY WANTED HIM TO RUN FOR SENATE. THERE WAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF CONCERNS FROM GEORGIA, REPUBLICAN POLITICOS THAT WERE LIKE, THIS IS A BAD IDEA. HERE IS WHY. HE DOESN'T LIVE IN GEORGIA, HERE'S A PICTURE OF HIS HOUSE IN TAXES, ALSO HE HAS THIS REALLY, REALLY ROCKY PASS, AND HE POINTED A GUN AT AN AXE, AND IT'S LIKE, SOMEHOW EVERY DAY IT'S A NEW STORY THAT'S EXACTLY THE THING THE GEORGIA REPUBLICAN SAID WHERE THE REASON WHY HE WOULDN'T BE A GOOD CANDIDATE.  YEAH, I THINK A LOT OF THOSE THINGS REVOLVE ALARMED WOMEN. AND THE STORIES THAT BROKEN DO TEND TO REVOLVE AROUND WOMEN. AND HIS FAMILY. THE SECRET CHILDREN. THE CONSTANT LYING. THE ABORTION THAT HE PAID FOR. AND NOW, THIS LATEST STORY WITH A WOMAN COMING FORWARD USING OUR NAME. VERY BRAVELY TO DETAIL VIOLENT EPISODES WITH HIM. MORE THAN THAT, FIVE YEARS INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM. TRYING TO HELP HIM MANAGE HIS DISSOCIATIVE IDENTITY DISORDER. WHICH EVERYBODY KNEW THAT HE HAD COMING INTO. I THINK THE MOST REMARKABLE THING OUT OF ALL OF THIS, TO ME. IS AFTER ROE V. WADE WAS OVERTURNED, AND A BUNCH OF REPUBLICANS STARTED TRYING TO SHADE -- THE CENTER, COME OFF AS MORE MODERATE. HERSCHEL WALKER PUT HIS FOOT ON THE GAS. AND WAS OUTSPOKEN ABOUT BEING ANTIABORTION CANADA. AND THE WHOLE TIME, HE'S KNOWN THAT THIS WAS THERE. IN HIS PAST. AND HE'S CONTINUED WITH. THAT  ONE MORE FOLLOW-UP TO YOU, ROGER. KIND OF THE ONE YOU INTERVIEW TODAY. HE'S VERY PUBLIC, OBVIOUSLY, ABOUT A STRUGGLES WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND HIS STORY IS, I WENT THROUGH TOUGH TIMES. I FOUND GOD, I TURN MY LIFE AROUND. I'M A DIFFERENT PERSON NOW. I'M READY TO SERVE AS YOUR SENATOR. SHE'S COMING FORWARD AND SAYING, I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE. IT'S KIND OF A TOP LINE AND WHAT SHE SAID TO YOU.  YEAH, I THINK SHE'S SAYING HOW SERIOUS THE PROBLEM IS BOTH HEM. SHE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT'S SERIOUS AS WELL. BUT POINTS TO THE BOOK AND CHRISTIANE IT E AS AN EXCUSE I GAS, MORE REASON THAT I'VE OVERCOME THESE THINGS. AND I DESERVE FORGIVENESS. EVERYBODY DOES FORGIVE -- THAT'S TRUE. IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED. THE YEAR AFTER THE BOOK WAS PUBLISHED, HE HAD A CHILD OUT OF WEDLOCK. AND A FEW MONTHS LATER, PAID A WOMAN TO HAVE AN ABORTION. WHILE HE WAS -- HIS WIFE, AND SEVERAL OTHER WOMEN I'VE SPOKEN WITH. IT WAS NOT AN INFLECTION POINT, IT DOESN'T SEEM IF YOU'RE JUDGING BEHAVIOR THAT WAY. I THINK IT'S GONE THAT -- PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO FORDHAM. AND TO OFFER HIM REDEMPTION. BUT BY HIS OWN TONGUE, HIS OWN ACTIONS, I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE WAR THAT BORN AGAIN POINT ACTUALLY BEGINS.  IN THE FINAL 30 SECONDS, HILLARY, IT SEEMS THAT RUSSIA -- FLYING AWAY FROM THIS GUY'S UNFIT TO BE YOUR SENATOR CRITIQUES. BEFORE, LESS SO NOW IT DOES SEEM LIKE A HUGE PART OF THE CLOSING END|20221202015955|2022-12-02_0100_US_MSNBC_All_In_With_Chris_Hayes ",

        "trs": "> IT WAS MY EXPERIENCE THAT MR. TRUMP INFLATED HIS TOTAL ASSETS WHEN IT SERVED HIS PURPOSES. SUCH AS TRYING TO BE LISTED AMONG THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN FORBES AND DEFLATED HIS ASSETS TO REDUCE HIS REAL ESTATE TAXES.  BUT TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE, DID THE PRESIDENT EVER PROVIDE INFLATED ASSETS TO A BANK IN ORDER TO HELP HIM OBTAIN A LOAN.  THESE DOCUMENTS AN OTHERS WERE PROVIDED TO DEUTSCHE BANK ON ONE OCCASION WHEN I WAS WITH HIM IN OUR ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN MONEY SO THAT WE COULD PUT A BID ON THE BUFFALO BILLS. > HI, AGAIN, EVERYBODY. IT IS 5:00 IN NEW YORK. YEARS AFTER WE FIRST HEARD THOSE CLAIMS FROM THE EX PRESIDENT'S PERSONAL ATTORNEY, TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS ARE JUST NOW FINALLY IN THE HANDS OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS. SIX YEARS AFTER THE EX PRESIDENT'S TAX RETURNS WERE BEING HANDED OVER FROM THE TREASURY TO THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE AFTER LAST WEEK THE SUPREME COURT REJECTED TRUMP'S ATTEMPT TO BLOCK THE RELEASE. HE WAS THE FIRST MAJOR PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE SINCE NIXON TO NOT PUBLISH HIS RETURNS AHEAD OF HIS ELECTION. CONGRESSMAN RICHARD NEIL NOW IN POSSESSION OF TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS BEGAN WAGING THIS BATTLE BACK IN APRIL OF 2019 ABOUT YOU SUPREME COURT'S RULING, HE SAID IT RISES ABOVE POLITICS AND COMMITTEE WILL NOW CONDUCT THE OVER SIGHT THAT WE'VE SOUGHT FOR THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS. REGARDING THE DEMOCRATS FINALLY GAINING ACCESS TO THOSE TAX RETURNS, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTS THIS, QUOTE, AT THIS STAGE THE LAW THAT ALLOWS THE CHAIR TO REQUEST A TAX RETURNS REQUIRES TREATING WITH CONFIDENTIALITY, DETAILS ABOUT ANY REQUESTS RETURNS THAT COULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH A PARTICULAR TAXPAYER. THAT SAME LAW ALSO ALLOWS COMMITTEE TO LATER PUBLISH THE RETURNS IN THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD WHICH COULD MAKE THEM PUBLIC. MR. NEIL HAS NOT ANNOUNCED WHETHER HE WOULD DO SO. A MEMBER OF NEIL'S COMMITTEE BELIEVES HE SHOULD. HERE IS CONGRESSMAN BILL PASS QUAL OF NEW JERSEY.  I WANT THEM ALL RELEASED. I THINK THESE RECORDS ARE SO IMPORTANT. THE DELAY HAS BEEN AS LONG AS THE CIVIL WAR. I MEAN, THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED IN EVERY WAY. THIS IS NOT ABOUT ONE MAN. THIS IS NOT ABOUT JUST ONE PART OF THE LAW. THIS IS WHETHER WE AFFIRM THAT THERE IS NO ONE IN THIS COUNTRY BE IT THE PRESIDENT, A CONGRESSMAN OR WHOM EVER THAT IS ABOVE THE LAW. AND WE ARE INTENT TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THIS.  IT IS A BIT OF A THEME THAT EMERGING TODAY, WHETHER THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE ABOVE THE LAW AND IT IS WHERE WE BEGIN THE HOUR WITH SOME OF OUR FAVORITE REPORTERS AND FRIENDS. CHARLIE SAVAGE IS HERE, FROM \"THE NEW YORK TIMES.\" ALSO AN MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR, HIS BY LINE IS READ FROM. WITH ME AT TABLE MICHAEL COHEN, AUTHOR OF THE NEW BOOK \"RE VENGE, HOW DONALD TRUMP WEAPONIZED HIS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.\" AND CHARLIE TAKE ME THROUGH YOUR REPORTING ON THIS EXTRAORDINARY STORY.  WELL, IT HAS BEEN A LONG LEGAL BATTLE SINCE EARLY 2019 WHEN HOUSE -- THE HOUSE CAME INTO DEMOCRATIC HANDS AND THEY STARTED TIE TRYING TO PERFORM OVER SIGHT OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND AMONG THE THINGS THEY WANTED TO DO WAS LOOK AT TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS, WHICH THEY LOST AS THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE IS ALLOWED TO REQUEST ANY TAXPAYERS TAX RETURNS. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT LET THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT TURN OVER THOSE DOCUMENTS, NOTWITHSTANDING THAT LAW. AND THE HOUSE FILED SUIT. AND THEN FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS A TRUMP APPOINTED JUDGE SAT ON THE CASE AND WOULD NOT MAKE A RULING ONE WAY OR ANOTHER, HELPING TRUMP RUN OUT THE CLOCK ON OVER SIGHT AND THEN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION CAME IN AND LOOKED AT THE LAW AND SAID THE COMMITTEE COULD GET THIS AND THAT RESTARTED THAT LAWSUIT THAT TRUMP APPOINTED JUDGE AGREED THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO SEE IT EVEN THOUGH HE HAD TAKEN TWO AND A HALF YEARS OFF THE CLOCK. AND THEN APPEALED UP AND FINALLY THE SUPREME COURT WITH THREE TRUMP APPOINTEES DECLINED TO BLOCK IT. SO NOW WITH JUST FOUR WEEKS TO GO BEFORE THE HOUSE IS GOING TO NO LONGER BE IN DEMOCRATIC HANDS, THIS SAGA IS COMING TO AN END AND THE QUESTION NOW IS WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO WITH THESE RETURNS NOW THAT THEY HAVE FINALLY GAINED ACCESS TO THEM.  MICHAEL COHEN, HAVE YOU SEEN THEM OR DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS IN THEM?  THE TAX RETURNS. THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO SAW THOSE TAX RETURNS WERE DONALD, ALLEN WEISSELBERG AND DONALD BENDER OF MAZERS AND HIS TEAM. OTHER THAN THAT I SAW THEM ON TABLE OUTSIDE OF THE CONFERENCE ROOM DOOR WHICH IS RIGHT ACROSS FROM MY OFFICE, SHORT OF THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN THE TAX RETURNS.  WHY DO YOU THINK TRUMP FOUGHT SO HARD TO HIDE THEM?  BECAUSE THE INFORMATION THAT IT COIN TAINS IS DAMAGING TO HIM. NOT JUST POTENTIALLY LEGALLY, BUT ALSO HIS FRAGILE EGO. HE'S BEEN TELLING THE ENTIRE WORLD, I'M REALLY RICH. RIGHT, I'M WORTH $10 BILLION MAYBE MORE. IT IS JUST NOT TRUE. AND WHAT THE TAX RETURNS WILL ULTIMATELY SHOW IS THAT HE PROBABLY RECEIVED MORE MONEY BACK FROM THE GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF REFUNDS THAN HE PAID IN. BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW THAT HE LOST A BILLION DOLLARS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. RIGHT. AND SO, YET HE STILL RECEIVED BACK WHAT WAS IT LIKE $170 MILLION IN REFUND. THERE IS A LOT HERE FOR THEM TO GO THROUGH. AND THERE IS A LOT OF INFORMATION IN THERE THAT IS GOING TO BE DAMNING.  HIS POLITICAL BRAND WAS OF A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MAN. ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE TAX RETURNS WILL SHOW HIM TO NOT HAVE BEEN.  THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING. I DON'T THINK I COULD SAY IT BETTER THAN THAT, NICOLLE.  CHARLIE, YOUR COLLEAGUES UNDERTOOK SOME INCREDIBLE REPORTING ON HIS TAXES. PIECING TOGETHER WHAT THEY COULD GET THEIR HANDS ON WHICH IS A LOT LESS THAN WHAT CONGRESS NOW HAS. WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF WHAT THE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATE WORK WILL BE NOW THAT THEY HAVE THE ENTIRE DOCUMENTS.  WELL THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO DO MUCH OF ANYTHING. AFTER JANUARY, WHEN REPUBLICANS TAKE OVER THE HOUSE, THEY WILL ABANDON THIS EFFORT. SO MAYBE THEY PUNT IT TO THE SENATE WHERE DEMOCRATS ARE STILL IN CHARGE OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE, OR MAYBE THEY VOTE TO MAKE THESE DOCUMENTS PUBLIC AND JUST PUT THEM OUT INTO THE HIVE MIND BY PUBLISHING THEM, WHICH THE LAWS ALLOWS THEM TO DO BUT IT IS RARE THAT THEY HAVE USED THAT LAW BUT NOT UNPRECEDENTED. BUT I'M NOT SURE THERE IS THAT MUCH TIME TO DO A STUDY OF THESE. THE REASON THEY WERE LOOKING FOR THEM, LOOKING SAND WANTING THEM WAS THEY WERE STUDYING A PROGRAM THAT AUDITS PRESIDENTS AND ONE OF THE BIG FIGHTS WAS THERE THAT WAS A PRETEXT AND THIS WAS A POLITICALLILY MOTIVATED PHISHING EXPEDITION. BUT I THINK FROM A REAL PERSPECTIVE, THERE IS A LOT OF POLITICAL REASON THAT DEMOCRATS MAY WANT TO JUST PUT THESE OUT IN THE WORLD.  WELL, AND THINK THAT THE OTHER HALF OF THAT CHARLIE, IS THERE ARE POLITICAL REASONS THAT TRUMP DIDN'T WANT THEM OUT INTO THE WORLD. I THINK OTHER THAN SORT OF HIS FIGHTS AGAINST DOING ANYTHING IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY CATEGORY AROUND COVID IS TO PROTECT HIS TAXES WERE AMONG THE VICIOUS. HE DID STEVE MNUCHIN I BELIEVE FOR A WHILE, IT WAS THE WORK OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO SHIELD HIS TAX RETURNS FROM SCRUTINY. IF YOU HAVE HAD HIM IN FRONT OF YOU, WHAT WOULD YOU LOOK FOR.  THE STARTING POINT IS WHERE INVESTIGATORS WHO HAVE GOTTEN GLIMPSES HAVE ALREADY GONE. THIS IS NOT LIKE APRIL 2019 WHEN THESE WERE UNDER LOCK AND KEY. SO ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS ARE THERE FURTHER REVELATIONS HERE THAT MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICE HAS GOTTEN A LOT OF FINANCIAL DATA, THE SUPREME COURT LET THEM DO THAT. AND NOW THEY ARE CRIMINALLY PROSECUTING THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. AND THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN NEW YORK IS CIVILLY SUING TRUMP AND HIS CHILDREN SAYING THAT THEY DEFRAUDED BANKS BY OVERSTATING THE VALUE OF ASSETS WHEN THEY WERE APPLYING FOR LOANS AND SO FORTH. SO THE QUESTION IS, AND THEN MY OWN COLLEAGUES, THEIR STUDY LAST YEAR FINDING THAT MOST YEARS TRUMP WASN'T PAYING ANY TAXES AT ALL AND THAT HE HAD TAKEN THIS GIGANTIC LOSS THAT WAS NOW THE SUBJECT OF AN IRS AUDIT, CLAIMING A GIGANTIC LOSS THAT FOR YEARS ALLOWED HIM TO WRITE OFF HIS TAXES ENTIRELY. SO THE QUESTION, IS THERE MORE? WHAT ELSE IS IN THERE? AND THAT IS A QUESTION THAT FROM THE OUTSIDE I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE ABOUT BUT I'M CERTAINLY VERY INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT.  AND HARRY, WHAT ABOUT FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW FROM THE SIX YEARS OF TAX RETURNS.  I WANT TO SAY AS TO THE FOUR YEAR DELAY, IT WAS COMPLETELY UNCONSCIONABLE. THE LAW SAID YOU SHALL TURN IT OVER AT TRUMP'S DIRECTION, MNUCHIN JUST STALLED FOR NO REASON. IT WAS LAWLESS. IT IS JUST A GOOD EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS WHEN YOU TAKE MERITLESS POSITIONS AND COUNT ON CONGRESS'S WEAKNESS TO BE ABLE SO STRIKE BACK. WHAT TO LOOK FOR, THERE ARE THE CRIMES THAT MICHAEL COHEN DOCUMENTED, THAT ACTUALLY IT APPEARS THAT THE NEW YORK D.A. MAY BE LOOKING AT, THE DISPROPORTIONAL ASSETS. AND THIS IS THE MOTHER LODE. AND IF DOJ DOESN'T HAVE IT, IF NOT THEY WILL. IT IS A FIRST THIN YOU WANT TO GET INTO A BIG POTENTIAL INVESTIGATION. THERE IS SO MUCH A FORENSIC ACCOUNTANT COULD DO WITH THIS, NOT TO MENTION THE POLITICAL DAMAGE. BUT THE BIG PROBLEM CHARLIE NAILS IT ON THE HEAD, THE OSTENSIBLE REASON IS HERE WE WANT TO STUDY THAT AUDIT PROGRAM. DO THEY REALLY? AND COULD THEY DO IT IN A MONTH. ? PROBABLY NOT. AND IF THEY PUBLISH THE RETURNS IT IS A BIT OF POLITICAL HARDBALL BUT I THINK YOU MAY SEE THEM PLAYING POLITICAL HARDBALL.  THE MUELLER TEAM NEVER HAD TRUMP'S TAXES AND DO YOU THINK DOJ HAS THEM AND HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THEY HAD THEM.  IT WOULD BE NICE FOR THEM TO TELL US. BUT WHILE I WAS ON YOUR SHOW SO MANY TIMES, I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT DONALD TRUMP'S POWER IS DELAY, DELAY, DELAY, AND I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING THAT HARRY LIT MAB JUST SAID. EVERYTHING. WHAT DONALD DID IS HE DELAYED ABILITY TO GET THE TAX RETURNS. YOU REMEMBER AT THE HOUSE OVER SIGHT COMMITTEE YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MR. CLAY AND ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ AND ALL ASKING ME QUESTIONS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S TAX, ABOUT HOW HE MOVES MONEY AROUND. AND I GAVE THEM THE ANSWER. THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THOSE TAX RETURNS IMMEDIATELY. SO THAT NOW WITH THE CHANGE OF THE HOUSE, IT WOULDN'T BE EFFECTED BY IT. AND THIS IS UNFAIR. IT IS UNFAIR TO AMERICA, IT IS UNFAIR TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT, CERTAINLY, I WOULD HAVE 48 HOURS TO TURN THEM OVER BASED ON SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK'S ATTITUDE. BUT THIS GUYS SKATES OVER TWO AND A HALF YEARS, WEAPONIZING, AS I SAID IN MY BOOK, WEAPONINGIZE THE GOVERNMENT AND TO PREVENT THE RETURNS FROM BEING SHOWN. AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO WIN THAT AGAIN. P AND THIS IS JUST WRONG. IT IS JUST --  WHAT IS THE REMEDY.  WE HAVE TO HOLD GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABLE TO MOVE IN A MORE EXPEDITIOUS MANNER. BECAUSE THE WAY THAT THEY MOVE NOW, ONLY BENEFITS THE GUILTY. AND DONALD TRUMP IS GUILTY OF ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS REGARDING HIS TAX RETURNS THAT I PUT FORTH DURING THAT OVER SIGHT HEARING.  TO CHARLIE'S POINT, DO YOU THINK THAT THE NEW YORK PROSECUTIONS HAVE HIS TAXES.  I BELIEVE THEY DO. I BELIEVE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS ABLE TO GET THEM AS WELL AND I BELIEVE THAT IF THE D.A. HAS THEM, ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS BETWEEN THE -- ARE BEING SHARED BETWEEN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE FROM WHAT I RECALL.  AND YOU THINK THAT IS HOW THEY CAME TO THE FRAUD CHARGE IN LETITIA JAMES'S KAY.  I THINK THAT CAME FROM A MUCH SIMPLER DOCUMENT, THE PERSONAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT.  RIGHT.  BY DONALD WHEN HE CLAIMED HIS HOUSE WAS WORTH OVER $370 MILLION AND THE BOTTOM OF EACH SECTION, THERE IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE ASSET. AND THE ASSET ALLEGED THAT THE PROPERTY WAS 33,000 SQUARE FEET, OVER THREE FLOORS BEING A TRI-PLEX, WHICH IT WAS 11,000 SQUARE FEET. AND SO THAT CLEARLY IS AN ERROR AND IT IS VERY HARD FOR HIM AS THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY, THE DEVELOPER OF THE PROPERTY, TO MAKE THE ALLEGATION, OH, HEY I JUST DIDN'T KNOW. RIGHT. IT IS ALLEN WEISSELBERG'S FAULT. NOTICE IT IS ALWAYS SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULT.  HE'S A NOTORIOUS MICROMANAGER.  NOTORIOUS IS RIGHT.  AND CHARLIE, WHAT THE HOUSE CAN DO, DEMOCRATS, HOUSE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS FOR SIX YEARS ABOUT FOREIGN MONEY, ABOUT EMOLUMENTS. IS THERE ANY WAY TO, AS YOU SAID, REFER THESE CASES TO DIFFERENT COMMITTEES IN THE SENATE. AND JUST TELL ME FOR ALL OF THE PILE UP OF QUESTIONS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S MONEY AND TIES TO FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND ENRICHING HIMSELF DURING THE PRESIDENCY AND THE USE OF THE TRUMP HOTEL AND THE -- I MEAN, THERE WERE MORE QUONS THAN WE COULD COME UP IN THE 45 MINUTES REMAINING IN THE SHOW. BUT HOW DO YOU BEGIN TO TRY TO ANSWER THEM IN THE FOUR WEEKS THAT ARE LEFT?  WELL, ONE THING, IN THE FOUR WEEKS THAT ARE LEFT, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT. THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TIME TO DO AN INVESTIGATION THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING. IT IS THE CASE THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE KEPT CONTROL OF THE SENATE AND SO SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE AND OTHER COMMITTEES IN THE SENATE COULD PICK UP THE BALL AND RUN HERE IF THEY HAVE GAINED ACCESS TO THE SAME DOCUMENTS. AND IN ADDITION, IF THEY MAKE THE DOCUMENTS PUBLIC, THEN THE MEDIA AND THE WORLD CAN SCOUR THEM AND PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER. SO THEY -- THIS SAME LAW THAT ALLOWS THE COMMITTEE TO OBTAIN THE DOCUMENTS, WERE SUPPOSED TO GET IT RIGHT AWAY, NOT FOUR YEARS LATER, BUT THEY HAVE THEM NOW, ALLOWED THEM TO VOTE TO SEND IT THE FULL HOUSE AND THAT MEANS PUT IT IN THE CONGRESSIONAL RECORDS SUCH THAT IT IS PUBLISHED AND THE PUBLIC COULD SEE IT. THE REPUBLICANS ON THE WAYS AN MEANS COMMITTEE WHEN THEY CONTROLLED IT IN 2014 DID THAT AS PART OF THE WHOLE IRS TARGET CONSERVATIVE GROUPS INVESTIGATION. AND THE CONGRESS DID IT ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS IN 1974 WHEN THEY STUDIED SOME OF THE RICHARD NIXON'S TAX RETURNS. SO IT DOESN'T HAPPEN VERY OFTEN BUT IT CAN BE DONE AND AT THAT POINT IT WILL BE THERE FOR ANYONE TO LOOK AT AND INVESTIGATE.  SO HARRY, THIS DELIBERATION THAT CHARLIE IS DESCRIBING IS LOOKLY GOING ON BETWEEN HOUSE DEMOCRATS AN THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE AND THE COUNSEL AND OTHERS, WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE THEM TO DO LEGALLY?  I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD GIVE THEM ADVICE BUT I COULD GIVE A LEGAL PREDICTION. THE ANSWER TO THE LEGAL QUESTION WHAT COULD THEY DO IS GOING TO BE WHO IS GOING TO STOP THEM. THERE ARE SOME UNCLEAR LINES HERE IN THEORY, THEY REALLY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HAVING THEM FOR A SPECIFIC REASON. BUT I DON'T SEE SPECIFIC LAWS AND EVEN IF THERE WERE SPECIFIC WAYS TO ENFORCE THEM, NOW THE SORT OF LEVERAGE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS AND THAT IS -- IF THEY CHOOSE TO GO THAT ROUTE, PUBLISH THEM, ET CETERA, WILL IT NOT -- ONCE THEY OPEN THE BARN DOOR, EVERYBODY HAS THEM AND AS CHARLIE AND MICHAEL SAID, THERE IS JUST SO MUCH TO GLEAN POLITICALLY, LEGALLY, ALL THE WAY DOWN THE LINE.  AND ON THE GOOD GOVERNMENT FRONT. WE COULD ALREADY PREDICT WHAT JIM JORDAN AND KEVIN McCARTHY WILL THREATEN. THEY'LL THREATEN TO INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS WHICH NAVE ALREADY DONE.  WANT PEOPLE TO GO BACK AND REMEMBER HOW THIS WHOLE THING, BECAUSE YOU BROUGHT UP THE TRUMP HOTEL IN D.C. UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, TRUMP MANAGED TO LIE, USING THESE TAX RETURNS, AND USING THAT PERSONAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT, TO OBTAIN THE PROPERTY, THE OLD POST OFFICE. THAT WAS UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. UNDER HIS ADMINISTRATION, AS YOU STATED, HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT. NOW I DON'T THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE A LINE IN HIS TAX RETURN THAT SAID PAYOFFS, OVERSEAS MONEY OR PAYMENTS AND SO ON. RIGHT. BUT THEN THE GREATEST PART IS NOW DURING THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER THE GUY WHO FRAUDULENTLY GOT THE PROPERTY, ENDS UP SELLING THE PROPERTY AND HE PULLS DOWN OVER $200 MILLION IN PROFIT, SELLING IT TO AN INSIDE GROUP THAT HE'S FRIENDLY WITH. WE AS A COUNTRY HAVE TO WAKE UP. WE NEED TO WAKE UP AND STOP ALLOWING ALL OF THIS TO GO ON. TO GET HIS TAX RETURNS, FOR FORGET ABOUT THE OTHER DOCUMENTS, JUST LOOK AT FACTS, THE FACTS BASICALLY DICTATE THAT THE MAN SHOULD BE INDICTED AND HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INDICTED YEARS AGO.  BUT HE'S ABOVE THE LAW IS CERTAINLY A DEFENSIBLE POSITION. CHARLIE, THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORTING AND MICHAEL AND HARRY STICK AROUND. WHETHER WE COME BACK, ANOTHER BIG LEGAL YOU KNOW WHAT FOR THE DISGRACED EX PRESIDENT WHICH IS NEARING A DRAMATIC CONCLUSION AS ARGUMENTS HAVE BEGUN. AND PLUS A QUESTION WE'VE HAD TO ASK OVER AND OVER AROUND HERE LATELY. HOW IS THIS HAPPENING? INDIANA ATTORNEY GENERAL DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO PUNISH A PHYSICIAN, A DOCTOR WHO TREATED A 10-YEAR-OLD RAPE VICTIM WHO HAD TO FLEE HER OWN HOME STATE TO GET ABORTION HEALTH CARE. AND LATER RICK STENGEL WILL BE HERE TO TELL US ABOUT HIS BRAND-NEW PODCAST ABOUT NELSON MANDELA. \"DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE\" CONTINUES AFTER A QUICK BREAK.

        "trs": "> CLOSING ARGUMENTS GOT UNDER WAY IN THE MANHATTAN D.A. TAX FRAUD TRIAL OF THE TRUP ORGANIZATION. ACCUSED OF A MULTI-YEAR SCHEME TO GIVE OFF THE BOOK PERKS TO TOP COMPANY EXECUTIVES. DEFENSE ATTORNEYS BEGAN THEIR CLOSING ARGUMENT WITH THE THEME SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE TRIAL. THAT THE COMPANY'S FORMER CEO AND STAR WITNESS FOR THE TRANSACTION ALLEN WEISSELBERG WAS RESPONSIBLE. AND HE TESTIFIED THAT TRUMP'S ELDEST SONS DON JR. AND ERIC DID NOT DISCIPLINE HIM AFTER THEY FOUND OUT. AND JOINING US TOM WINTER. THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME THAT IT EVER HAPPENED. WHAT A WEIRD DEFENSE. DID PEOPLE BUY IT?  Reporter: WELL, I THINK IT IS A SHARP THING FOR THEM TO DO. IF THE JURY DO BELIEVE IT IS ALL ON ALLEN WEISSELBERG, MAYBE THEY'LL SAY THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION DOESN'T KNOW AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE IS A DEVELOPMENT HERE THAT MIGHT CENTER AROUND THAT. SO ALL THROUGHOUT THE DEFENSE'S CLOSING ARGUMENTS, PARTICULARLY SUSAN NECKLY AND HER ARGUMENTS THIS MORNING ON BEHALF OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION, SHE POINTED OUT THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT AND HIS FAMILY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON HERE, THAT THIS WAS SOMETHING AND ALLEN WEISSELBERG ADMITTED TO THIS CONDUCT, THAT HE WAS TAKING PERKS AN NOT PAYING HIS TAXES ON IT. THIS IS ON HIM, AN EFFORT TO LINE HIS POCKETS AND HIS GREED AND THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE FOCUSING ON. THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION IF ANYTHING MAY BE MORE OF A VICTIM. BUT IN DOING SO, AND LATER WE ALSO HEARD THAT THE FORM HE PRESIDENT COULDN'T HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS. HE'S BUILDING GOLF COURSES AND BUILDING BUILDINGS AND HE'S NOT IN THE WEEDS ON WHO IS DOING WHAT ON THEIR TAX RETURNS AND BY THE WAY HE PAYS MAZARS $2.5 MILLION A YEAR AND DONALD BENDER TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LAW. THEY DID INVOKE THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S NAME. IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WHERE HE HAS BEEN THE STAR OF THIS BECAUSE HE'S NOT BEEN CHARGED OR ACCUSED OF ANY ILLEGALITY IN THIS CASE SO ONCE THE JURY LEFT THE COURTROOM THIS AFTERNOON, THE DEFENSE SAID, WAIT A MINUTE THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL WE'VE BEEN SAYING WHAT THE CASE IS AND WHAT IT ISN'T AND DONALD TRUMP ISN'T ON TRIAL HERE. EFFECTIVELY PROSECUTION ARGUING ON BEHALF OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE HERE SAID NOT SO FAST. YOU BROUGHT UP WHAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT MAY HAVE KNOWN OR NOT KNOWN IN THE COURSE OF YOUR CLOSING ARGUMENTS, AND I BELIEVE I SHOULD HAVE SOME ROOM TO GO THERE IN MY CLOSING ARGUMENTS WHEN THEY CONTINUE TOMORROW. THE JUDGE SAID, LOOK, RECALLED NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WHERE YOU BROUGHT THIS UP ADDRESSING THE DEFENSE, THIS MORNING SO YES IF THE PROSECUTE WANTS TO ADDRESS THAT, THEY CAN. A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT NOTES. IT IS NOT LIKE DONALD TRUMP WILL BE CLARNLED AT THE LAST SECOND TOMORROW. THEY HAVE TO PLAY WITH THE EVIDENCE BEEN PRESENTED SO FAR IN THIS CASE. AND AS WE KNOW, THERE IS NO SMOKING GUN EMAILS INVOLVING THE FORMER PRESIDENT. THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS TIED TO HIM, NO SORT OF NOTES, NO SORT OF DECLARATIONS THAT HE WAS PARTICULARLY AWARE OF ANYTHING THAT COULD TIE HIM DIRECTLY TO THE TYPES OF TAX FRAUD AND SCHEMES THAT ALLEN WEISSELBERG HAS PLED GUILTY TO. AND IF THE MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE HAD SOMETHING TO CHARGE DONALD TRUMP WITH, JUST BASED ON THEIR PUBLIC STATEMENTS AN THE ASSISTANT -- AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WHILE HE WAS CAMPAIGNING AND WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE OFFICE IN THE PAST, THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE MOVED FORWARD WITH THAT PROSECUTION ALREADY. BUT IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE TOMORROW IF JOSHUA STEINSUNGLASSES ARGUING ON BEHALF OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IF THEY HAVE SOME THEORIES ABOUT WHAT TRUMP KNEW WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THEIR CLOSING ARGUMENTS COULD WALK THE JURY THROUGH THAT. WHAT THAT ULTIMATELY DOES FOR THIS JURY REMAINS TO BE SEEN. BUT CLEARLY THEY'RE TRYING TO DRAW A CONNECTION, THE PROSECUTION IS, IN THEIR EFFORTS TO PROVE THIS CASE THAT THE UPPER LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION CERTAINLY ALLEN WEISSELBERG WOULD QUALIFY AS THE CFO, THEY SAY, WERE AWARE OF THIS. THERE IS SOME BENEFIT THAT IS A KEY PHRASE IN THE ELEMENTS OF LAW HERE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SEEK TO PROVE THERE WAS SOME BENEFIT TO THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION. THEY ARGUE IT IS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND IN MEDICARE PAYROLL TAX THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY AS WELL AS PAY RAISES THAT THEY WOULD HAVE HAVE TO GIVE TO INDIVIDUALS TO COVER THEIR TAXES FOR THEIR PERKS. SO, THAT IS WHAT WE MIGHT SEE TOMORROW. THE JURY COULD BEGIN DELIBERATIONS HERE AS SOON POTENTIALLY AS EARLY AS MONDAY, NICOLLE.  MICHAEL COHEN, MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT ALL THAT TRUMP DID IN HIS OFFICE WAS PLAY IN THE WEEDS. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT HE WAS IN THE DARK?  THERE IS NO CHANCE. AND, LOOK, I UNDERSTOOD THE ROUTE THAT DEFENSE COUNCIL IS GOING. IT IS THE ONLY PLAY. I'M A LITTLE SHOCKS THAT ALLEN WEISSELBERG WOULD RISK POTENTIALLY SPENDING THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN PRISON FOR LYING WHICH IS WHAT HE'S DOING. ALL OF A SUDDEN DONALD DIDN'T KNOW, LISTEN, LET ME BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING THAT -- THAT TOM JUST MENTIONED. FIRST OF ALL, THERE WERE TWO PROSECUTORS, THE TWO LEAD PROSECUTORS IN THIS CASE FOR OVER TWO YEARS. MARK POMERANZ AND KERRY DUNN. THAT IMPLORED THEM TO BRING AN INDICTMENT AGAINST DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE THEY KNOW FROM THE DOCUMENTS FROM THE TESTIMONY THAT THEY HAVE HIM ON EVERYTHING. FOR WHATEVER THE REASON IS, ALVIN CHOSE NOT TO DO AND WE'RE SUFFERING.  AND POMERANZ QUIT.  THEY RESIGNED IN PROTEST. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, AND I WANT TO BE SO CLEAR ABOUT THAT, THERE IS NOTHING THAT GOES ON AT THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION THAT DONALD TRUMP'S HANDS ARE NOT IN. NOW, HE'S CORRECT, TOM, THAT THERE ARE NO EMAILS BECAUSE DONALD NEVER HAD AN MAIL ADDRESS. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DO HAVE. YOU HAVE THE CONTRACTS FOR PROPERTY, FOR THE LEASES. IT IS DONALD'S PROPERTY, THE CAR PAYMENTS, ALL PAID BY CHECKS SIGNED BY DONALD. THE FACT THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO EVEN GET THE VEHICLES WAS ALL OFF OF THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION LINE OF CREDIT WITH MERCEDES. WHICH IS WHAT THEY ALL ENDED UP GETTING AS A PERK. IT IS ABSOLUTELY --  WHY DID TRUMP COMPENSATE THAT WAY. TO SAVE MONEY.  TO SAVE MONEY AND SO HE DIDN'T HAVE TO RAISE PEOPLE'S SALARIES. ONE OF THE THINGS DONALD WOULD PRIDE HIMSELF ON AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS PEOPLE THAT WILL ATTEST TO THIS STATEMENT, THE MORE YOU PAY YOUR EXECUTIVES, THE STUPIDER YOU LOOK. THAT IS HIS THEORY. AND SO IF HE COULD GIVE YOU A PERK AND KEEP YOU FROM ASKING FOR A RAISE, WHAT WOULD HE SAY TO ALLEN WEISSELBERG, HIS CFO, IF ALLEN CAME TO HIM AND SAID I NEED ANOTHER 100,000. HE'S NOT GOING TO GIVE IT TO HIM. OF COURSE HE IS. BUT HE DIDN'T WANT TO DO FOR THE SAME REASON. HIGHER PAYROLL TAXES AND FICA AND STATE AND CITY AND ET CETERA. SO YES, THERE IS A BENEFIT TO TRUMP. AND THE NOTION THAT ANYBODY COULD CLAIM THAT DONALD DIDN'T HAVE HIS LITTLE FINGERS INTO THIS, AND SIGNING CHECKS AND KNOWING EVERYTHING, IS ABSOLUTELY LUDICROUS. HE KNEW EVERY SINGLE THING THAT WAS GOING ON IN COMPANY. HE IS THE ULTIMATE MICRO MANAGER.  TOM, YOU WANT THE LAST WORD.  YEAH, I THINK IT IS INTERESTING TO SEE, YOU KNOW, MICHAEL JUST RAISED SOMETHING THERE, THIS IDEA OF GROSSING UP AND THE PROSECUTION IS TELEGRAPHED THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET INTO THAT TOMORROW. THE IDEA OF GROSSING UP INCOME. SO EFFECTIVELY, AND TO SUMMARIZE, IF I'M CORRECT, MICHAEL, WHAT IS BEING TALKED ABOUT HERE IS THAT THE IDEA THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD HAVE HAD TO PAY THESE EXECUTIVES MORE IN SALARY FOR THEM TO THEN PAY THE TAXES ON THESE PERKS. WHO KNEW WHAT ABOUT THAT AND WHEN AND HOW THAT MIGHT HELP THE PROSECUTION BRING HOME THEIR CASE, I THINK IS SOMETHING BY THIS TIME TOMORROW WE'LL HAVE A BETTER HANDLE ON, NICOLLE.  AND THAT IS A GREAT POINT. AND LET ME JUST PUT MY OWN SCENARIO INTO THAT TO JUSTIFY EVERYTHING THAT YOU JUST SAID. WHEN I PAID STORMY DANIELS THE $130,000 AND OTHER MONEYS THAT THEY OWED ME, WHAT ALLEN, MYSELF AND DONALD HAD DONE IS EXPLAINED TO DONALD AND DONALD DIDN'T NEED MUCH EXPLANATION, IS THE CONCEPT OF GROSSING UP. WHICH IS WHY THEY ANDED UP HAVING TO DOUBLE THE AMOUNTS THAT WERE OWED TO ME BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE A TAX CONSEQUENCE AS A RESULT FROM TAKING BACK THE VARIOUS MONEYS THAT DONALD OWED ME THAT I HAD LAID OUT IN HIS -- AND FOR HIS BENEFIT. SO THE NOTION THAT DONALD DOESN'T KNOW WHAT GROSSING UP, THAT HE'S NOT 100% FAMILIAR WITH THAT CONCEPT, IF ALLEN MADE THAT STATEMENT TO THE JURY, IT IS A LIE. IF HE TURNED AROUND AND HE CONTINUES TO MAKE THE ALLEGATIONS THAT DONALD DID NOT HAVE DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF EVERY ONE OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, IT IS AN ABSOLUTE LIE. AND HE'S PUTTING HIMSELF AT RISK. IF IN FACT, THE D.A. CALLS HIM ON IT.  HE LEARNED IT FROM THE STORMY DANIELS HUSH MONEY PAYMENT. THAT IS AN INCREDIBLE LITTLE FOOT NOTE OF HISTORY. THANK YOU FOR THAT.  YOU'RE WELCOME.  THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. > WHEN WE COME BACK. A GRIM REMINDER OF WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE AIMING TO DO IN A POST-ROE AMERICA.

        "trs": "> I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER, IT WAS ONE OF THOSE POST ROE HORROR STORIES IN THE EARLY DAYS AFTER THE SUPREME COURT DECISION A 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL FROM OHIO, A VICTIM OF RAPE WAS FORCED TO FLEELER HOME IN HER HOME STATE IN ORDER TO BE TREATED AT AN ABORTION CLINIC IN INDIANA. OUT OF RESPECT OF HER PRIVACY, HER STORY ENDS HERE. BUT OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS THE INDIANA ATTORNEY GENERAL TODD ROKITA, AN ANTI-ABORTION ELECTED REPUBLICAN OFFICIAL HAS TARGETED DR. CAITLIN BERNARD. HE BEGAN AN INVESTIGATION INTO HER, TRIED TO SUBPOENA HER PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORDS AND NOW THIS. MR. ROKITA IS ASKING THE STATE MEDICAL BOARD TO DISCIPLINE DR. BERNARD. HER PUNISHMENT IS UP TO THE BOARD. AND THE SOUGHT INCLUDE TO SUSPENDING OR PERMANENTLY REVOKING HER LICENSE. JOINING US NOW, KATTY KAY CORRESPONDENT FOR BBC STUDENTS AND MARY GAY, \"NEW YORK TIMES\" BOARD MEMBER, BOTH ARE MSNBC CONTRIBUTORS. WE HAVE ALL HAD THIS CONVERSATION PRETTY REGULARLY SINCE DOBBS WAS ON THE HORIZON AND SINCE TEXAS ENACTED THE VIGILANTE ABORTION LAW. I DON'T KNOW THAT AN INCIDENT MORE WRENCHING AND ILLUSTRATING OF THE PAIN THAT THE REPUBLICAN EXTREMISM CAUSES YOUNG GIRLS HAS COME ABOUT OTHER THAN THIS CASE. AND TO NOW SEE THE DOCTOR, THE HEALTH CARE PROVIDER PUNISHED IS -- IS MAYBE NOT SURPRISING BUT EXTRAORDINARY, MARA.  THERE IS A LOT OF THOUGHTS THAT GO THROUGH YOUR MIND, BOTH AS A REPORTER AND AS A WOMAN. AND A CITIZEN. THERE IS A LEVEL OF MEANNESS AND VINDICTIVENESS THAT IS BEHIND THAT KIND OF POLICY MAKING. IF YOU COULD EVEN CALL IT THAT. KNOWING AS SOMEONE WHO WORKS IN POLITICS THAT THAT DECISION IS -- IS BEING MADE TO PROSECUTOR TO GO AFTER THIS DOCTOR. YOU KNOW, MOST LIKELY TO SCORE POLITICAL POINTS. YOU KNOW, SO USING TWO LIVES NOW THAT WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, THIS YOUNG GIRL AND NOW THE DOCTOR, FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES IS IN AND OF ITSELF DISGUSTING. YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE CHILLING EFFECT THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE ON PHYSICIANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING BY THEIR PATIENTS AND UPHOLD THEIR HIPPOCRATIC OATH. YOU ALSO HAVE THE FEAR THAT -- FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL DOCTOR, THE TARGET THAT THIS PUTS ON THAT PERSON'S BACK. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK IN GENERAL THAT THE OTHER THING THAT REALLY MAKES ME ANGRY, PERSONALLY IS I THINK THIS HYPER FOCUS ON ABORTION ITSELF, AS OPPOSED TO WOMEN'S HEALTH IN GENERAL, AND SO, YOU KNOW, THE DEBATE OVER ABORTION COULD BE HAD IN GOOD FAITH ON BOTH SIDES AND THOUGH I AM FIRMLY PRO-CHOICE AND I BELIEVE IN A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, I HAVE PLENTY OF FRIENDS WHO ARE RELIGIOUS WHO FEEL DIFFERENTLY. I UNDERSTAND THAT. WHAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IS WE HAVE A HUGE MARTERNAL CHALLENGE IN THIS COUNTRY AND YOU DON'T HEAR ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THIS MOVEMENT IS ABOUT PROTECTING LIVES, YOU KNOW, IT IS REALLY ABOUT PUNISHING WOMEN AND ABOUT POLITICS. AND THAT LAZ NO PLACE IN A HOSPITAL SETTING. IT HAS NO PLACE DECIDING WHAT HAPPENS TO A 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL. AND IT HAS NO PLACE RUINING A DOCTOR'S LIFE FOR TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING. SO ALL THE WAY AROUND, IT IS A DARK, DARK MOMENT.  YEAH, I MEAN, LOOK TO MARA'S POINT, CATTY, THE MOVEMENT DOESN'T EVER GET INTO CHILD POVERTY, CHILD HUNGER, YOU KNOW, CHILD NUTRITION, CHILD EDUCATION, CHILD HOUSING. IT IS JUST ABOUT A WOMAN NOT HAVING A RIGHT TO MAKE A CHOICE ABOUT HER OWN BODY AND HER OWN PREGNANCY. AND THIS, WHILE IT IS THE OBVIOUS EXTENSION OF GOP POLITICS AROUND THIS EXTREME VERSION OF ANTI-CHOICE POLITICS, THAT THEY ARE COMPLETELY HOSTAGE TO, DESPITE THE ELECTORAL CATASTROPHE IT HAS BROUGHT ABOUT FOR THEM, THERE ARE REAL PEOPLE AND THIS -- I'VE SPOKEN TO THE ATTORNEY FOR DR. BERNARD, THE PHYSICIANS CHILDREN HAVE BEEN THREATENED, SHE'S BEEN THREATENED. THERE ARE REAL CONSEQUENCES TO THESE EXTREME POLITICS.  YEAH, AND SHE HAS SAID THAT HERSELF IN AN INTERVIEW RECENTLY THAT SHE FEELS UNDER THREAT AND THAT NOT JUST WHEN IT COMES TO ABORTION CARE, BUT THIS WILL LIMIT THIS KIND OF INTIMIDATION OF PHYSICIANS WILL LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO TREAT THINGS LIKE COMPLICATIONS WITH MISCARRIAGES, IVF TREATMENT, COMPLICATIONS IN EARLY PREGNANCY, ALL OF THAT IS UNINTENDED POTENTIALLY CONSEQUENCE OF THE DOBBS RULING, BUT WHICH PHYSICIANS ARE FEELING IN REALTIME AS THEY HAVE TO USE THE KINDS OF PROCEDURES THEY MIGHT USE IN A SURGICAL APPORTION ON SOMEBODY WHO HAS A FETUS THAT IS MAL FORMED FOR EXAMPLE. BUT YOUR RIGHT TO POINT OUT THE ISSUES AROUND CHILDREN. BECAUSE ON MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU POINTED OUT, NICOLLE, AMERICA FARES MUCH WORSE THAN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS SURROUNDING CHILD PREGNANCY IN THIS COUNTRY, IT IS SOMETHING LIKE, I LOOKED THEM UP BEFORE WE CAME ON AIR. ONE IN NINE GIRLS SUFFER SEXUAL ABUSE IN THIS COUNTRY. THREE IN TEN TEENAGE GIRLS WILL HAVE AT LEAST ONE PREGNANCY. AND PREGNANCY IS THE MAIN REASON THAT TEEN GIRLS ARE DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL IN AMERICA. THAT IS NOT TRUE IN OTHER DEVELOPED WESTERN NATIONS. AND IN AMERICA IT IS LAGGING BEHIND ON THOSE FRONTS AND THE DOBBS RULING POTENTIALLY AND THE TREATMENT OF DOCTORS LIKE DR. BERNARD IF THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO PERFORM THE KIND OF PROCEDURE THEY HAVE TO PERFORM, THIS AWFUL TRAGIC CASE OF THIS 10-YEAR-OLD, WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT REPLICATED WITH 13-YEAR-OLD, 15-YEAR-OLD, 16-YEAR-OLDS, WHO MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ABORTION IN THIS COUNTRY AND MORE LIKELY THEREFORE TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL SAZ A RESULT OF THAT AND THEIR LIVES WILL BE CHANGED AND THEY WON'T HAVE THE KIND OF EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC PROSPECTS THEY MIGHT HAVE DONE. SO FOR A WHOLE RANGE OF REASONS, THIS CHILLING. THIS IS INTIMIDATION OF PHYSICIANS.  I HATE TO DO THIS. THERE HAS BEEN SOME BREAKING NEWS SINCE WE'VE COME BACK FROM THE BREAK. DONALD TRUMP SPECIAL MAST SER NO MORE. THE 11th CIRCUIT HAS RULED THAT THE TRUMP CASE CHALLENGING THE MAR-A-LAGO SEARCH WARRANT SHOULD BE DISMISSED IT VACATES THE LOWER COURT ORDER APPOINTING A SPECIAL MASTER AND ENJOYING THE GOVERNMENT FROM USING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS IN ITS INVESTIGATION. IT IS A MAJOR WIN FOR THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. DISMISSING TRUMP'S ALBEIT BOGUS ARE REQUEST, IT DID SUCCEED IN DELAYS FOR A WHILE THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO THE CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS HE SEIZED AND STOWED AND LIED ABOUT RETURNING. LET ME READ SOME OF THE RULING TO YOU. IT SAID THIS. P THE LAW IS CLEAR, WE COULD NOT WRITE A RULE THAT ALLOWS ANY SUBJECT OF A SEARCH WARRANT TO BLOCK GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS AFTER THE EXECUTION OF THE WARRANT. NOR CAN WE WRITE A RULE THAT ALLOWS ONLY FORMER PRESIDENTS TO DO SO. AS STERN OF A REBUKE AS WE'VE HEARD IN THIS CASE, KATTY KAY.  YEAH, I WAS JUST LOOKING IT UP MYSELF BECAUSE THIS IS JUST COMING IN. LOOK, THE SPECIAL MASTER WAS SOMETHING THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD WANTED AND THE TRUMP APPOINTED JUDGE HAD AWARDED HIM. IT WAS SEEN AS A BIG VICTORY FOR HIM AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME. AS A WAY OF MANAGING TO PUT LIMITATIONS ON THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, BUT NOW THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO HAVE -- NOT HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS ROAD BLOCK. THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ALREADY HAD THE DOCUMENTS AND TIME TO GO THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS BUT THIS WAS ONE MORE HURDLE THEY WON'T HAVE TO FACE ANY MORE.  MARA, MICHAEL COHEN KNOWS OF WHAT HE SPEAKS BECAUSE HE WAS PART OF IT. AND THAT IS A COMPLICATED THING ABOUT MICHAEL COHEN. BUT HE WAS PART OF THE EFFORTS TO JAM UP INVESTIGATIONS, TO STYME TRANSPARENCY OF TRUMP ORGANIZATION WHEN HE TURN SERVED AS TRUMP'S LAWYER. BUT HIS POINT THAT JUSTICE IS ALWAYS DELAYED WHEN IT COMES TO TRUMP AND BECAUSE THE DELAY TACTICS CAN BE SUCCESSFUL, BECAUSE THE NORMAL SYSTEMS DON'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT SUCH A CORRUPT ACTOR LIKE DONALD TRUMP. IT PROVES TRUE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND IN THIS CASE, HE SUCCEEDED IN SLOWING WHAT FELT LIKE AN INCREDIBLY ACCELERATED INVESTIGATION COMING OUT OF THE COURT APPROVED SEARCH OF MAR-A-LAGO AT THE END OF THE SUMMER. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS FINAL LEGAL ROAD BLOCK BEING CLEARED TODAY BY THE 11th CIRCUIT?  YEAH, IT IS ENCOURAGING FOR EXACTLY THE REASON THAT YOU DESCRIBED. WHICH IS THAT, INSIDERS LIKE MICHAEL COHEN AND COLLEAGUES OF MINE COVERING DONALD TRUMP SINCE THE '80s, NOW THE CONTEXT IS IMPORTANT HERE. THIS IS DONALD TRUMP'S GO-TO WAY TO EVADE ACCOUNTABILITY WHETHER IT IS NOT PAYING TAXES, OR ANY POTENTIAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY HERE THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT. HE LIKES TO JAM THINGS UP. AND HOPE THAT, YOU KNOW, WELL I'LL JUST FORGET ABOUT IT OR GET SO EXHAUSTED OR FRUSTRATED THAT HE'LL GET AWAY WITH THIS AGAIN AND I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO THE PRESERVATION OF OUR DEMOCRACY THAT WHATEVER WAS, IF THERE WAS A CRIME COMMITTED, THAT WE SEE THAT PROSECUTED. THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT GOAL. IT IS GOOD TO KEEP YOUR EYES ON PRIZE. AND SO THIS IS A WIN FOR -- FOR THE COUNTRY IN GENERAL. WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS MOVING FORWARD. AND SEE WHAT IS WHAT.  JOINING OUR COVERAGE, ANDREW WEISSMANN, FORMER JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROSECUTOR AND ALSO FORMER GENERAL COUNSEL TO THE FBI, NOW AN MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST. AFTER THE WEEK WE HAD WE'RE GOING TO MAKE YOU AN OFFICIAL CO-ANCHOR BECAUSE NEWS KEEPS BREAKING. THIS SEEMS LIKE A VERY CLEAR VICTORY FOR DOJ.  YEAH. THIS COULDN'T BE CLEARER AND TO THE POINT THAT YOU WERE JUST DISCUSSING, THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE COURT HELD WHICH WAS THE COURT SAID, AS THEY FRANKLY SAID AT THE ORAL ARGUMENTS, THAT THERE IS NO SEPARATE DIFFERENT RULE FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS A FORMER PRESIDENT. THE COURTS ARE NOT ALLOWED FOR ANYBODY WHO IS UNDER INVESTIGATION TO ENJOIN ANOTHER BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. SO ON SEPARATION OF POWERS, JUST TO BE A LEGAL NERD HERE, THE COURT WAS SAYING WE HAVE TO BUD OUT, WE WON'T DO IT FOR A FORMER PRESIDENT, WE WON'T DO IT FOR ANYONE, IT IS NOT WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE COURTS TO ENJOIN A ONGOING CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. AND THEY'RE QUITE POINTED THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT ENTITLED TO ANY EXTRA PROTECTION. IF YOU RECALL, JUDGE CANNON WHO IS NOW BEEN REVERSED TWICE, DID SAY THAT. SHE SAID THERE WAS EXTRA PROTECTION BEING GIVEN TO DONALD TRUMP. SO I COMPLETELY AGREE THAT THIS IS A VERY GOOD OPINION FOR THE RULE OF LAW. AND AGAIN, SHOWS THAT WE'RE SEEING JUDGES REGARDLESS OF WHO APPOINTED THEM, AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS, UNDERSTANDING THE POINT OF A JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND SORT OF THE FOUNDING PRINCIPLES THAT THIS COUNTRY IS FOUNDED ON, THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT PARTY YOU'RE IN, THAT THE RULES APPLY EQUALLY TO EVERYONE. THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE. BUT I THINK THIS OPINION IS REALLY ROCK SOLID IN UPHOLDING THAT PRINCIPLE. IT MEANS THAT THE MATTER BEFORE THE JURY IS NOW OVER. AND THE ROLE OF JUDGE CANNON IS NOW OVER. AND ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO SEE AND USE CAN NOW BE USED SO THAT IS REALLY FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE SHOULD BE FULL STEAM AHEAD.  SO WHAT IS FULL STEAM AHEAD LOOK LIKE INSIDE OF THE FBI. ? IS THERE A FILE CABINET LOCKED UNDER THE 11th CIRCUIT RULES AND SOMEONE IS UNLOCKING IT AND GETTING BACK TO WORK. TELL ME WHAT IS HAPPENING?  YEAH. ABSOLUTELY. SO, WHAT IT MEANT WAS THAT WITH RESPECT TO ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE NOT CLASSIFIED, NOT MARKED CLASSIFIED, THE GOVERNMENT WAS PROHIBITED FROM USING THOSE AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS YOU COULDN'T SHOW THEM TO WITNESSES AND SEE IF THIS WERE WOULD REFRESH THEIR RECOLLECTION. YOU COULDN'T HAVE THE TRIAL TEAM SEE THEM AND THE WAY THAT WE COULD SHOW THAT DONALD TRUMP KNEW HIS CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS WAR THERE WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE INTERMINGLED WITH HIS PERSONAL DOCUMENTS INCLUDING NOTES THAT HE TOOK AFTER HE LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE, FOR INSTANCE. SO THERE IS A LOT OF EVIDENTIARY WAYS IN WHICH THIS COULD BE IMPORTANT TO THE GOVERNMENT TO ULTIMATELY SHOW KNOWLEDGE AND INTENT. THOSE ARE THE CRITICAL THINGS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO SHOW IF THEY WERE TO CHARGE DONALD TRUMP. DID HE KNOW THAT THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE THERE, DID HE INTEND TO KEEP THEM AND NOT RETURN THOSE DOCUMENTS? NOW I KNOW IT SEEMS OBVIOUS TO ALL OF US THAT WE'RE LIKE OF COURSE THAT IS THE CASE. BUT WHAT SEEMS OBVIOUS HAS TO REQUIRE PROOF IN COURT BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. SO THAT IS A VERY HIGH STANDARD. SO, THE GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO SEE THE FULL PICTURE OF EXACTLY WHAT WAS FOUND AT MAR-A-LAGO, WHERE WAS EACH AND EVERY DOCUMENT AND WHAT WAS IT NEXT TO. THAT IS SOMETHING THEY COULD NOT DO UNTIL TODAY.  SO THE 11th CIRCUIT AS YOU SAID HAS -- JUDGE CANNON ERRORED, CANNON ERRED. IS THERE ANY RECOURSE OR EXAMINATION OF WHY SHE WAS SO PRO-TRUMPY, AND WHETHER OR NOT HIS APPOINTMENT OF HER AND HER UNIQUE AND NOVEL LEGAL ANALYSIS CAME ABOUT AT THE TIME THAT IT DID?  THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO. YOU KNOW, UNLESS THERE IS GROSS MISCONDUCT THAT IS PROVABLE, JUDGES HAVE EXTRAORDINARY POWERS AND DISCRETION, AND THEY ARE BY DESIGN NOT CHECKED BY THE OTHER BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. YOU KNOW, WE'VE SEEN THAT MOST RECENTLY WHEN PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT ETHICS RULES IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHETHER IT'S JUSTICE THOMAS NOT RECUSING HIMSELF OR THE CURRENT ISSUE OF ENORMOUS ACCESS TO VARIOUS JUSTICES, WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE LEAKING TO THOSE PEOPLE. ALL OF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S VERY MUCH LEFT TO THE JUDICIAL BRANCH, AND IT'S UNFORTUNATELY -- IT REQUIRES JUDICIAL BRANCH TO POLICE ITSELF BECAUSE THE HARM OF HAVING ANOTHER BRANCH POLICE THEM IS CONSIDERED TOO GREAT BECAUSE YOU DO WANT THIS INDEPENDENCE. AND FRANKLY, WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY IN THE 11th CIRCUIT DECISION IS A SIGN OF THAT INDEPENDENCE WHEN THE COURT SAYS THIS IS NOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. THIS IS ABOUT EQUAL JUSTICE WHERE WE WOULDN'T DO THIS FOR ANYONE IN YOUR FORMER POSITION OF BEING PRESIDENT OR NOT BEING PRESIDENT IS IRRELEVANT TO THE PRINCIPAL HERE, AND PART OF THE REASON THEY CAN DO THAT IS BECAUSE THE JUDICIARY IS INDEPENDENT, ISN'T TIED TO THE ELECTION SYSTEM, AND THEY CAN MAKE THOSE KINDS OF DECISIONS.  AND, ANDREW, I ONLY ASK BECAUSE THE THREE JUDGES ON THE PANEL WHICH RENDERED THIS DECISION TODAY WAS SO STRONG AND A REAL REBUKE OF JUDGE CANNON WERE APPOINTED BY GEORGE BUSH, AND DONALD TRUMP. THE OPINION, DISSOLVING THE SPECIAL MASTER AND PROCESS. THE LAW IS CLEAR, WE CANNOT WRITE A RULE THAT ALLOWS ANY SUBJECT OF A SEARCH WARRANT TO BLOCK GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS AFTER THE EXECUTION OF THE WARRANT. NOR CAN WE WRITE A RULE THAT ALLOWS ONLY FORMER PRESIDENTS TO DO SO. EITHER APPROACH WOULD BE A RADICAL REORDERING OF OUR CASE LAW, LIMITING THE FEDERAL COURT'S INVOLVEMENT IN CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS, AND BOTH WOULD VIOLATE BEDROCK SEPARATION OF POWER LIMITATIONS, ACCORDINGLY WE AGREE WITH THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE DISTRICT COURT IMPROPERLY EXERCISES EQUITABLE JURISDICTION AND THAT DISMISSAL, THE ENTIRE PROCEEDING IS REQUIRED. ANDREW, AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL WITH TRUMP, AND THE PEOPLE AROUND HIM, WHEN THEY'RE UNDER THIS KIND OF CRIMINAL SCRUTINY, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT HIS REACTION TO BE?  I EXPECT THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THE EQUIVALENT OF THE SORT OF MELTDOWN AND MAYBE TWEETS OF, YOU KNOW, WHERE HE ATTACKS. ANYBODY WHO IS OPPOSING HIM WHO HAS ANY SORT OF -- EXERTS ANY POWER, WHETHER IT'S THE MEDIA, WHETHER IT'S PROSECUTORS, WHETHER IT'S AT TIMES MITCH McCONNELL OR MIKE PENCE. I MEAN, ANYBODY WHO STANDS UP TO HIM, HE DENIGRATES USUALLY NOT IN ANY WAY THAT IS THOUGHTFUL OR HE ARTICULATES A REASON, BUT IT'S USUALLY BY INVECTIVE, WHICH, YOU KNOW, APPARENTLY, YOU KNOW, HE THINKS WORKS AND GOD KNOWS I'M HARDLY THE PERSON TO SAY IT DOESN'T WORK, BUT IT'S A SHAME THAT IT DOES. NICOLLE, ONE THING THAT I WOULD POINT OUT JUST ANOTHER, JUST TO BE NERDY WITH RESPECT TO THE DECISION, ONE THING THE COURT SAYS THAT IS JUST SO STRONG, IT ENDS WITH TO CREATE A SPECIAL EXCEPTION HERE WOULD DEFY OUR NATION'S FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE THAT OUR LAW APPLIES QUOTE TO ALL WITHOUT REGARD TO NUMBERS, WEALTH OR RANK. I MEAN, YOU COULDN'T GET A MORE -- A STRONGER OPINION THAT IS SAYING THERE ARE NO SPECIAL RULES IN THIS COUNTRY, AND IT FRANKLY SOUNDS A LOT LIKE WHAT MERRICK GARLAND HAS REPEATEDLY SAID WHICH IS NO PERSON IS ABOVE THE LAW AND EVERYONE SHOULD BE HELD TO ACCOUNT. SO AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS, YOU KNOW, QUITE A WEEK FOR THE RULE OF LAW AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WITH THE OATH KEEPERS VERDICT, THE PRESS CONFERENCE BY ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND, AND NOW THIS DECISION WHERE A SEPARATE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT IS VERY MUCH NOW FOR THE SECOND TIME DOCKING THE GOVERNMENT IN ITS APPEAL OF JUDGE CANNON, AND NOW THEY DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH HER ANYMORE. IT'S -- THEY BASICALLY HAVE, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE TAKEN SOME BOLD STEPS IN APPEALING AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S GREAT TO SEE THE COURTS RESPONDING THIS THIS WAY, IN AN APOLITICAL MANNER. > SO ANDREW, WE TALKED ABOUT THE OATH KEEPERS VERDICT SORT OF, I THINK YOU USED THE WORD STILL IN THE SPINE, I THINK JOYCE USED THE WORD WIND IN THE SAILS. THIS SORT OF AFFIRMATION THAT THE RULE OF LAW IS ALIVE AND WELL FROM TWO TRUMP APPOINTED JUSTICES, ONE GEORGE W. BUSH JUSTICE, DOES THAT SEND EVERYONE OUT FOR RED BULL AND SAY LET'S GET TO WORK, LET'S GET TO THE BOTTOM. WHAT IS THE SORT OF PIECE THAT WE CAN'T SEE? WHAT IS THE TANGIBLE EFFECT OF THE WEEK THAT WAS FOR THE RULE OF LAW INSIDE DOJ?  WELL, MY ANALOGY IS WHEN I -- YEARS AGO, THIS WAS 20 YEARS AGO NOW, WAS ASSIGNED TO THE ENRON TASK FORCE, WHEN WE SAW ONE OF THE TOP TEN COMPANIES IN AMERICA DISSOLVE IN A MATTER OF WEEKS AND THERE WERE JUST ENORMOUS NUMBER OF VICTIMS, THE REAL ISSUE WAS THAT WE FELT THIS INTERNAL PRESSURE TO BRING EVERYONE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE TO JUSTICE AND TO MAKE SURE WE DIDN'T MAKE ANY MISTAKES. AND I CAN REALLY ASSURE YOU THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW. THE SENSE OF INTERNAL PRESSURE TO MAKE SURE THEY ACT AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, AND THEY'RE AS THOROUGH AS POSSIBLE.  ANDREW WEISSMANN, THANK YOU AGAIN FOR POPPING UP AND HELPING US THROUGH TWO HOURS ON THE AIR. KATTY KAY AND MARA GAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US.

        "trs": "DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S BAD FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, CAN'T ENTIRELY DISCOUNT THE IDEA TO CHOOSE THIS GUY TO RUN THE THING?  I AM 100% RUNNING FOR THE RNC CHAIRMAN AGAINST RONNA MCDANIEL. 100 PERCENT, I'M ALL IN STEVE. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR COUNTRY AND IT'S A 2018 FAIL, 2020 FAIL, 2020 TO FAIL. THAT'S THREE FAILS IN A ROW.  WELL HE'S NOT WRONG ABOUT THAT. MY PILLOW IS CORRECT THAT THE REPUBLICANS ESSENTIALLY LOST THREE CONSECUTIVE ELECTIONS, AND THE RNC AND RANA MCDONALD'S FORMED AN EXPERT PANEL TO FIND OUT WHAT WENT WRONG IN THE MIDTERMS THREE WEEKS AGO. HOW FOR INSTANCE TODAY END UP WITH A GUY CALLED BLAKE MASTERS AS A SENATE CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA, A MAN WHO HAD A SUPER PAC TO SCORE THE WORST FOCUS GROUP RESULTS OF ANY CANDIDATE HE HAD EVER SEEN, THEN WENT ON TO LOSE, FORMALLY READ ARIZONA BY A WHOPPING FIVE POINTS. WHO DO ASK WILL BE IN THE EXTRA PANEL TO CONDUCT THIS 2022 AUTOPSY? ABOUT ONE OF THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DEMISE OF THE PATIENT? BLAKE MASTERS. YES, THAT GUY. BLAKE MASTERS HAS BEEN TAPPED BY THE RNC CHAIR, FORMALLY MID TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. TIM MILLER, SERVICE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR JEB BUSH'S COMMUNICATION CAMPAIGN. JEN PSAKI IS A FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY FOR JOE BIDEN, AND A HOST FOR MSNBC. JOE WHAT DO, MAKE OF A BLAKE MASTERS ON THE REPUBLICAN AUTOPSY COMMITTEE? THERE  --  YOU ARE GETTING IN THERE!  I WAS THEIR BABY, I WAS THERE. OR I MADE SOME GREAT SUGGESTIONS THAT WERE NOT TAKEN. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU RECALL, BUT AN INTERESTING FACT THAT THE CREEPY BLAKE MASTERS, SEPARATE FROM THAT FOCUS GROUP THERE, A DIFFERENT REPUBLICAN POLLSTER TOLD ME THEY NEVER SEEN THE WORD CREEPY SO MUCH IN A VERBATIM'S OF A POLL THAN THEY DID IN THE SENATE RACE IN ARIZONA. IN ADDITION TO HIM, THEY BROUGHT BACK HENRY BARBER WHO WAS THERE WITH ME IN 2012. DAILY BARBERS NEPHEW TO RUN THIS THING, AND I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING. HENRY TO HIS CREDIT WAS ONE OF THE ONES WHO SAID THE PARTY NEEDS TO REACH OUT MORE THAN MINORITIES, TO WOMEN, SOFTEN THE EDGES ON CERTAIN POLICIES, AND IMMIGRATION, TURNING OFF THESE VOTERS. BUT THEY ARE MIXING HIM IN WITH HARVEY DYLAN, AND SHE'S THERE WITH BLAKE IN ARIZONA, THEY ARE PUSHING THE STOP THE STEAL STUFF WITH KARI LAKE. THERE'S A LITTLE MIXING BOWL OF AN AUTOPSY. A LITTLE BIT OF PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATISM AND A LITTLE BIT OF ELECTION DENIALISM AND WILL KIND OF SEE WHAT COMES AT THE OTHER SIDE.  WHERE YOU GOTTA HAVE HAYLEY BARBER'S NEPHEW IN THEIR. FOR ANY POSTMORTEM ON THE ELECTION. JEN, IT DOES STRIKE ME THAT FOR ALL OF THE BUOYANCY THE DEMOCRATS HAVE AFTER THAT ELECTION, THERE IS A FIRE EARLY STRAIGHTFORWARD THING YOU CAN SAY HERE THAT I THINK IS SOMEWHAT WORRYING FOR DEMOCRATS. IF YOU WOULDN'T NOMINATE CREEPY WEIRDOS, AND IF YOU DIDN'T COMMIT YOURSELF TO A FRONTAL ASSAULT ON AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, YOU KNOW, THERE'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO COULD BE MIKE DEWINE WINNING BY 15 POINTS. WHICH AGAIN IS NOT GREAT FOR DEMOCRATS BUT IT DOESN'T EVEN SEEM THAT COMPLICATED TO ME?  NO, AND LOOK GOVERNOR KEMP, NOT GREAT FOR DEMOCRATS. LIKE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, NOT GREAT FOR DEMOCRATS. YOU CAN ARGUE OVER THE SUBSTANCE IN ALL OF THESE CASES, BUT IF REPUBLICANS HAD PICKED, AND FRANKLY HAD RECRUITED, AND LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE WORKED FOR HAVE WORKED FOR SOME OF THESE OUTSIDE SENATE REPUBLICAN GROUPS WILL TELL YOU THIS, THEY DID NOT GET THEIR TOP RECRUITS. AND STATING THE OBVIOUS YEAR, I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT. AND AS A RESULT, THEY HAD CREEPY, SLIGHTLY CRAZY KIND OF WAY OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM CANDIDATES AT A TIME WHEN HISTORICALLY REPUBLICANS SHOULD HAVE WON BACK MANY, MANY SEATS. SO YES, THERE IS A PATH THEY COULD CERTAINLY TAKE. I DON'T THINK MY PILLOW GUY WHO BY THE WAY, THE ALL REMEMBER, TODAY THAT HE WAS PHOTOGRAPHED A WEEK BEFORE TRUMP LEFT WHEN HE HAD THE MEETING AND HE HAD ON THE PICTURE OF HIS NOTES WAS, I WROTE THIS DOWN BECAUSE I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. INSURRECTION ACT, MARSHALL LAW IF NECESSARY RIGHT? THAT'S THE GUY WHO'S RUNNING FOR RNC CHAIR. THEY DON'T SEEM TO HAVE LEARNED THE LESSONS BUT, YOU'RE RIGHT CHRIS, THERE ARE SCARY THINGS FOR DEMOCRATS, BECAUSE IT COULD PICK A NORMAL-ISH REPUBLICAN TO MAKE IT A HARDER CHALLENGE FOR DEMOCRATS IN 2024.  IT IS SUCH A WEIRDLY LOW BAR. WE SHOULD NOTE THEY'LL JUST TO GET A SCOPE OF THIS, THE THOUGHT OF HIS FASCINATING, THIS COMES FROM A MAGAZINE WHICH IS FANTASTIC RESERVES. THEY DO THIS AMAZING ELECTION RUNDOWN, A LOOK AT LOCAL ELECTION, SO IT IS JUST PEOPLE CHECK IT OUT. BOLTS MAGAZINE. REPUBLICANS GAINED ONLY 22 LEGISLATIVE SEATS THIS FALL OUT OF MORE THAN 6000 THEM ARE ON THE BALLOT. SO TIM, CONTRARY TO MY FIRST POINT, I'M NOW ARGUING AGAINST MYSELF WHICH I LIKE TO DUKE BECAUSE AN ILLIBERAL. CONTRARY TO THE FIRST POINT, THE REALLY BAD CANDIDATES. THERE'S SOMETHING BROADER THERE, WHEN YOU'RE ONLY PICKING UP 22 LEGISLATIVE SEATS ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHEN THERE WERE HUNDREDS PICKED UP IN 2010 ANOTHER BIG WAVE ELECTIONS?  I WOULD SECOND THAT BOLTS IS AWESOME, IT'S A GREAT BAG. I THINK THAT SOME OF THOSE LOWER CANDIDATES WHO ARE RUNNING FOR LOWER OFFICE, SCOTT DRAGGED DOWN. I THINK THINGS ARE RELATED. I THINK REPUBLICANS DID REALLY WELL, DEMOCRATS DID POORLY WELL IN FIGHTING STATE LEGISLATIVE RACES. DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT GOT BACK INTO THAT GAME, IN A SMALLER FIELD. THEY'RE A LOT OF FACTS AT PLAY HERE. OBVIOUSLY I THINK THAT PARTICULARLY IF YOU LOOK AT A STATE LIKE ARIZONA, THERE COULD HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LEGISLATIVE GAINS THAN THEY HAD AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET NOT BEING SO WEAK. GEORGIA REPUBLICANS DID PRETTY WELL IN STATE LEGISLATIVE AND THESE LOWER SEATS, BECAUSE BRIAN KEMP WAS ON TOP OF IT, AND IT WASN'T JUST HERSCHEL WALKER. IF IT IS JUST BEEN HERSCHEL WALKER, A 2022 NUMBER MIGHT BE AN EVEN LOWER.  THAT'S 22. FINAL POINT HERE JEN, THIS IS A BIT OF AN ELEVATED QUESTION BUT I DO THINK THERE'S GENUINE IDEOLOGICAL EXHAUSTION IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. NOT SO MUCH IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. EVERYONE THAT IS TRYING TO MAKE IDEOLOGICAL IDEOLOGICAL COHERENCE OUT OF TRUMP, THERE'S SOME GESTURES THERE HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN ABLE TO PULL IT OFF. SO AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S LIKE WHAT IS DISTINCT? THEY DON'T HAVE A PLATFORM. WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO THIS TIME? AROUND THE GONNA CUT SOCIAL SECURITY. ARE THEY GONNA VOTE FOR THE RAILWAY STRIKE? AND THEN A VOTE FOR THE BOSSES OF THE? WORKERS YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING AT THE CORE OF ALL THIS CULTURE WAR STUFF. IT'S HARD TO GET THAT FAR IF YOU DON'T.  LOOK THERE IS SOME MORAL GROUNDING HERE LACKING AND I HAVE BEEN OF COURSE HISTORICAL TIME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS OVER DECADES. BUT THERE ARE SOME VIEWPOINTS THAT USED TO BE STALWARTS AND TIM CAN SPEAK TO THIS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHICH IS BEING AGAINST ANTI -- BEING FOR HELPING COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WHO ARE FIGHTING BIG BULLIES LIKE RUSSIA. THERE ARE BIG VOTES, RAISING THE DEBT LIMIT SO WE ARE NOT AT THE BRINK OF FINANCIAL COLLAPSE. THE QUESTION IS, WHO ARE THEY? AND I DO THINK THERE ARE SOME REPUBLICANS, MAYBE MORE THAN A FEW EVEN MITCH MCCONNELL WHO DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE, WHO ARE ROOTED IN THAT, BUT ARE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH RIGHT NOW TO CONTINUE TO BE VOCAL ABOUT THAT AND LEAD ON THOSE FRONTS. THAT'S A PROBLEM AS WELL.  MITCH MCCONNELL I WILL SAY HERE. MITCH MCCONNELL IS A VERY TRADITIONAL POLITICIAN.  YEAH.  HE UNDERSTANDS WHO'S MATERIAL INTERESTS HE REPRESENTS, AND HE'S LASER FOCUSED ON THAT. HE'S NOT SITTING THERE SAYING, ARE WE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOSSES IN THIS LABOR DISPUTE? HE KNOWS ISN'T US ON THE SIDE OF THE CHEMICAL COMPANIES. HE KNOWS JUDGES AND FOLKS OPPOSED TO ABORTION. BUT THOSE ARE MATERIAL INTERESTS OR COALITION INTERESTS. IT'S NOT AN IDEOLOGY, AND NOT TO ME IT'S STILL THE SORT OF BIG MISSING THING AT THE CORE OF ALL THIS.  WHO ARE? THEY  YES WHO ARE. THEY JEN JEN PSAKI, 10 MILLION, YOU GUYS ARE GREAT. THANK YOU. STILL TO COME AFTER BASICALLY BEING DARED BY JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS OF THE SEVEN WHEN I HANDED IT. WHEN IT PASSED LEGISLATION PROTECTING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.

        "trs": " THE VOTE YESTERDAY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE WAS HISTORIC FOR MANY REASONS. IT GOT OVER THE 16 VOTE THRESHOLD, BECAUSE UTAH REPUBLICAN SENATOR MITT ROMNEY VOTED FOR THE BILL. EVEN THE CHURCH OF LATTER DAY SAINTS ENDORSEMENTS TO NAME A FEW. THE BILL WAS THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT. WHEN IT PASSED, IT CODIFY THE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS FROM EX MARRIAGES INTO U.S. LAW. YEARS OF TOUGH LEGISLATIVE WORK, SAYING THAT ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE MAY HAVE MOST TO THANK FOR IT IS SUPREME COURT JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS. IT WAS HIS THREAT WRITTEN IN A CONCURRING OPINION WHEN HE AND THE OTHER RIGHT-WING JUSTICES OVERRULED 50 YEARS OF, PRECEDENT BY STRIKING DOWN ROE V. WADE. IT MADE IT PERFECTLY CLEAR, WE ARE COMING FOR EVERYTHING, HE BASICALLY SAID IN HIS CONCURRENCE, INCLUDING MARRIAGE EQUALITY. THAT WAS THE SPARK FOR THIS BILL. THE WAKE OF THE DISASTROUS DECISION AND WE HAVE SEEN POLITICAL MOBILIZATION IN STATE HOUSES TO FIGHT TO PRESERVE IN THE SUPREME COURT TAKING AWAY OR APPEARS TO BE TARGETED. JOINING ME NOW IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE INSTRUMENTAL OF THE HOUSE VERSION OF THIS, NEW YORK DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN MONDAIRE JONES. THE LEGISLATIVE SUCCESS HERE, --  THE HOUSE WILL VOTE ON THIS BILL, AND IT WILL PASS. IT IS NOT PERFECT, THERE WILL STILL BE WORK TO DO. EVERY SINGLE STATE IN THIS UNION, IT'S A MAJOR STEP FORWARD. IT'S UNLIKE ANYTHING THAT I IMAGINED GROWING UP CLOSETED, AND UNTIL RECENT YEARS, SEEING ALL OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE. CHRIS, AS YOU KNOW, THE MAIN IMPETUS FOR THIS IS THE SUPREME COURTS FORESHADOWING THAT IT WILL NOT ONLY TAKE AWAY MARRIAGE EQUALITY, OVERRULING ITS OWN PRECEDENCE, BUT THAT IT'S ALREADY COMING FOR AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS, AS THEY'RE TAKING AWAY THE 50-YEAR-OLD CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION.  TESTING MY OWN THESIS HERE IN THE AND SHOULD ACTION OF THE SEGMENT, HOW MUCH IT WAS THAT CLIENTS THOMAS CONCURRENCE, WHICH GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION, UNDERSTANDABLY, OR HE BASICALLY SAYS THAT THERE IS AN ENTIRE LINE OF CASES, DUE PROCESS, LIBERTY RIGHTS. WHAT YOU CAN DO IN THE SORT OF -- WHAT YOU CAN BE PROTECTIVE FOR THE STATE INTERFERING IN. THIS IS FOR FAMILIAL AND PERSONAL AUTONOMY. THERE'S A LOT OF CASES, ALL HOGWASH, WE WANT TO COME FOR ALL OF IT. HOW MUCH DID THAT FACTOR IN GETTING TO THIS POINT WHERE YOU HAVE NOT GOTTEN? THIS BILL ABOUT TO BE PASSED BY THE HOUSE AND SIGNED INTO LAW.  IT WAS A HUGE IMPETUS. A LOT OF TIME, FOLKS WILL CATER AND LEGISLATION IN THE SPACE. THE ONLY TIME YOU'LL GET A FLOOR VOTE IS IF HE PERCEIVED BY THE LEADERSHIP AND AMERICAN PUBLIC. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT ALSO PROTECTS THE RIGHT TO INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE. ISN'T IT CRAZY THAT IN THE YEAR 2022, CONGRESS HAS TO RESPOND TO A THREAT EMANATING FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY? THROUGH THE SUPREME COURT, WITH RESPECT TO PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT RACES TO GET MARRIED? THIS IS STUFF THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED IN OUR EVERYDAY LIVES THAT ARE NOW IN QUESTION BECAUSE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND IT'S EXTREMISM. AS LONG AS WE HAVE THE GAVEL, DEMOCRATS WILL FIGHT TO PROTECT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS.  I SHOULD NOTE THAT IN THAT CONCURRENCE, HE LISTS A BUNCH OF THESE CASES, GRISWOLD BEING THE BIRTH CONTROL CASE. THERE IS ROE, GRIFF OLD, LAWRENCE, THE SODOMY CASE. I DON'T THINK HE ACTUALLY MENTIONS LOVING GEORGIA, WHICH DEFINES THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO MARRIAGE EQUALITY. NOTING THAT THAT WAS EMITTED FROM THAT. THERE ARE OTHER GROUNDING THINGS FOR THE CONSTITUTION. WHAT DOES IT MEAN ABOUT THE POLITICS OF THIS ISSUE TO SEE 60 VOTES? THE SORT OF GLASS HALF FULL AND YOU STILL HAVE 36 REPUBLICAN SENATORS VOTING AGAINST THIS. TO SEE CYNTHIA IN WYOMING, MITT ROMNEY IN UTAH VOTING FOR THIS LEGISLATION, AND IT PASSING WITH A --  IT CAN BE INTERPRETED INTO DIFFERENT WAYS. I AM EVER THE OPTIMIST, AND SO I'M PLEASED THAT IN ADDITION TO THE UNANIMOUS DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT FOR THE SIMPLE PROPOSITION OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY, FOLKS BEING ABLE TO LOVE WHO THEY LOVE AND LIVE FREELY, AND LIVE AS FULL HUMAN BEINGS. A DOZEN REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE ALSO JOINED THE CHORUS. AS I MENTIONED, THE MAJORITY OF REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE DID NOT. WHICH IRONIC ABOUT THIS IS THAT THERE IS SO MUCH ABOUT STATES RIGHTS AND REPUBLICANS. THIS IS LEGISLATION THAT SIMPLY SAYS THAT THE STATES CAN DECIDE WHETHER THERE WILL BE MARRIAGE EQUALITY IN THOSE STATES, AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TO RECOGNIZE IT. NOW THAT WE ARE PROTECTING STATES RIGHTS IN THIS CONTEXT, REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING UP SOMETHING ELSE. IT WAS NEVER ABOUT STATES RIGHTS, IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT HOW CAN WE DESCRIBE AGAINST MARGINALIZED PEOPLE?  WE SHOULD BE CLEAR WHAT YOU JUST SAID. DOESN'T MANDATE A NATIONAL REGIME OF MARRIAGE EQUALITY IN ALL 50 STATES. THAT'S WHAT THE CRIPPLED DECISION EFFECTIVELY DOES. YOUR EXISTING MARRIAGE, AND IS PROTECTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ALABAMA COULD STILL, IF THEY WERE TO OVERTURN OBERGEFELL, OVERTURN MARRIAGE EQUALITY. BUT IT DOES SECURE THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN MARRIED IN STATES THAT DO RECOGNIZE IT.  THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THEREIN LIES THE OUTSTANDING WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO. IT'S WHY DEMOCRATS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO GET ENOUGH SENATORS TO GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER, SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON REPUBLICAN SUPPORT, AND SO THAT WE CAN EXPAND UPON THIS IMPORTANT WORK THAT WE'RE GOING TO CODIFY AFTER A FINAL PASSAGE IN THE HOUSE NEXT WEEK. THEY WILL STILL BE ABOUT 30 OR SO STATES AFTER THIS LEGISLATION WAS PASSED, WHERE ACCORDING TO STATE CONSTITUTIONS AND STATUTORY LAW, MARRIAGE EQUALITY IS NOT GOING TO EXIST IN THOSE STATES IF AND WHEN THE SUPREME COURT OVERRULES ITS OWN RECENT PRECEDENT IN OBERGEFELL, SAYING THAT MARRIAGE IS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT IN THE LAND.  THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE SEEN THIS HAPPEN, 1859 LAW. IT THAWED, LIKE END|20221201015955|2022-12-01_0100_US_MSNBC_All_In_With_Chris_Hayes ",

FOUR YEARS LATER OBAMA, A PROGRESSIVE PRESIDENT WE HAVE HAD, AND BARACK OBAMA SAID HE WAS AGAINST SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, AND FOUR YEARS LATER IN THE 2012 CAMPAIGN, JUST A DECADE AGO, JOE BIDEN GOT ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED BY THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE, WAS -- I REMEMBER IT IN REAL TIME, GETTING REPORTS OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE THAT NOBODY WOULD TALK TO HIM. HE WOULD GO INTO MEETINGS, AND HE WAS DEAD MAN WALKING INSIDE THAT WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE HE DARED TO GO ON \"MEET THE PRESS\" AND SAY HE SUPPORTED SAME-SEX MARRIAGE. THINK ABOUT THAT.

JOE, WHAT AN EXAMPLE THIS ISSUE IS OF HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE OFTEN FURTHER AHEAD THAN POLITICIANS ON HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES. YOU LOOK AT WHERE VICE PRESIDENT -- THEN VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, WHERE HE WAS AND HOW HE WAS AHEAD OF THE POLITICS WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT, BUT HE COULD TELL WHAT THE PULSE OF THE VOTERS WAS. YOU LOOK AT TODAY AND MOST REPUBLICANS ARE BEHIND THIS, AND IT'S JUST SUCH A HUMAN RIGHTS TRIUMPH IN AMERICA THAT THIS IS NOT EVEN A POINT OF DEBATE OR POINT OF CONVENTION ANYMORE, REALLY, BUT IT'S JUST -- YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER ISSUES THAT THERE STILL ARE OUTSTANDING, AND WE STILL HAVE PLACES TO COME. I WONDER IF WOMEN'S HEALTH, THOUGH, IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHERE POLITICIANS ARE OUT OF STEP OF WHERE THE VOTERS ARE.  YOU GOT 12 REPUBLICANS TO VOTE ON THIS, AND STILL A BUNCH DID NOT VOTE FOR THE FEDERAL PROTECTION OF GAY MARRIAGE. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK OVER THE LAST DECADE OF WHERE BARACK OBAMA WAS, AND WE HAVE HAD GUESTS ON OUR SHOW TEN YEARS AGO, AND DUNCAN WAS THE EDUCATION SECRETARY, AND IT WAS A BIG DEAL WHEN HE SAID I SUPPORT SAME-SEX MARRIAGE, AND THAT WAS BIG BREAKING NEWS. AND THE POLLS IN THE COUNTRY, EVEN AMONG THE REPUBLICANS IT'S A VAST MAJORITY DECISION TO RESPECT AND HONOR GAY MARRIAGE IN THIS COUNTRY. QUITE A MOVEMENT IN A DECADE.  YEAH, THERE HAS NOT BEEN NOTHING MORE QUICKLY IN THE PUBLIC AS GAY MARRIAGE. 12 REPUBLICANS, MORE THAN THEY ANTICIPATED THEY WOULD GET. IT WAS A TRIUMPHANT MOOD IN THE SENATE YESTERDAY, AND NEXT WEEK IT'S EXPECTED TO PASS AND PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID HE WILL SIGN IT AS SOON AS HE CAN.

ALL THE THINGS WRITTEN ABOUT JOE BIDEN IN THE 2020 CAMPAIGN, THAT HE COULDN'T WIN, HE WASN'T UP TO IT, HE'S TOO OLD, HE BEAT EVERYBODY AND THEN HE BEAT DONALD TRUMP. AND LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN 2022. RED WAVE, RED WAVE, RED WAVE, EXCEPT WE WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT A RED WAVE. HE OUTPLAYS EVERYBODY'S EXPECTATIONS FOR HIM, IT SEEMS JUST ABOUT EVERY TIME.  HE KNOWS HIS POLITICS. HE KNOWS THE LONG GAME AND HE KNOWS HOW TO WALK THROUGH THE NAYSAYERS AND THE UNDERESTIMATING AND PUT THE BLINDERS ONTO THAT AND MOVE FORWARD. IF YOU LOOK AT HOW HE'S HANDLING UKRAINE, WHICH IS AN UNBELIEVABLE HUGE ISSUE, IT'S MASTERFUL. AMERICANS ARE LESS TUNED INTO THAT BECAUSE OF THE DIVISIONS AND ECONOMY THEY FACE AT HOME. HE FOCUSED ON ABORTION AND THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND RESTORING OUR DEMOCRACY. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE TOUCH POINTS WERE NO MATTER WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS SAYING.  WILLIE, HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED FOR TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY, TALKING ABOUT ABORTION. I WOULDN'T MENTION THE PODCAST BUT I LISTENED TO A PODCAST THE WEEK BEFORE THE ELECTION, PEOPLE THAT EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS. THE ENTIRE PODCAST WAS MOCKING AND RIDICULING JOE BIDEN FOR FOCUSING ON ABORTION AND ON DEMOCRACY. HE ENDED UP BEING RIGHT. THEY ALL ENDED UP BEING WRONG.  CHECK THE EXIT POLLS IN PENNSYLVANIA AND MICHIGAN. HE WASN'T ALONE IN BELIEVING ABORTION WAS GOING TO BE A PERSISTENT ISSUE BUT A NARRATIVE FORMED THAT, WELL, IT WAS RED HOT IN THE SUMMER AND DIED DOWN.

JOE, WHAT AN EXAMPLE THIS ISSUE IS OF HOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE OFTEN FARTHER AHEAD THAN POLITICIANS ON HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES, AND YOU LOOK AT WHERE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN -- THEN VICE PRESIDENT -- WHERE HE WAS, AND HOW HE WAS AHEAD OF THE POLITICS WITHIN THE DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT, BUT HE COULD TELL WHAT THE PULSE OF THE VOTERS WAS. YOU LOOK AT TODAY, AND, YOU KNOW, MOST REPUBLICANS ARE BEHIND THIS, AND IT'S JUST SUCH A HUMAN RIGHTS TRIUMPH IN AMERICA THAT THIS ISN'T EVEN A POINT OF DEBATE, A POINT OF CONTENTION ANYMORE, REALLY. BUT IT'S JUST -- YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER ISSUES THAT THERE STILL ARE OUTSTANDING, AND WE STILL HAVE PLACES TO COME. I WONDER IF WOMEN'S HEALTH, THOUGH, IS JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHERE POLITICIANS ARE OUT OF STEP WITH WHERE THE VOTERS ARE.  GOT 12 REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR THIS, TO GET OVER 60 VOTES, STILL A BUNCH DID NOT VOTE FOR FEDERAL PROTECTION OF GAY MARRIAGE. LOOK AGAIN JUST OVER THE LAST DECADE WHERE BARACK OBAMA WAS. GUESTS ON OUR SHOW TEN YEARS AGO, JOE MENTIONED THIS YESTERDAY. ARTIE DUNCAN, EDUCATION SECRETARY. ASKED HIM ON THE AIR, IT WAS SEEN AS A BIG DEAL. YEAH, I SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE. I THINK PEOPLE OF THE SAME SEX WANT TO MARRY WE SHOULD HONOR THAT. BIG BREAKING NEWS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE MOVEMENT AND THE POLLS IN THE COUNTRY, EVEN AMONG REPUBLICANS, IT'S NOW A VAST MAJORITY POSITION TO RESPECT AND HONOR GAY MARRIAGE IN THIS COUNTRY. QUITE A MOVEMENT IN A DECADE.  ARGUE, NOTHING HAS MOVED SO QUICKLY IN PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE AS THE IDEA OF GAY MARRIAGE. IT'S FINE AND THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STAY OUT OF IT. 12 REPUBLICANS MORE THAN THEY ANTICIPATED WOULD GET. IT WAS SORT OF A TRIUMPHANT MOOD IN THE SENATE YESTERDAY AFTER THIS HAPPENED. GOES TO THE HOUSE NEXT WEEK WHERE IT'S EXPECTED, OF COURSE, TO PASS AND PRESIDENT BIDEN SAID HE WILL HAPPILY SIGN IT SOON AS HE POSSIBLY CAN. BIDEN, JOE MENTIONED, AHEAD OF MANY DEMOCRATS AHEAD ON THIS ISSUE BACK WHEN HE WAS VICE PRESIDENT AND COMES AT A TIME TAKEN UP BECAUSE OF THE DOBBS DECISION AND ABORTION RIGHTS OVERTURNED AND A QUICK MOVE TO CODIFY THIS, PROTECT THIS. IT HAPPENED, IT HAPPENED QUICKLY. OPPONENTS ARE REALLY PLEASED AND SEE IT SIGNED IN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO.  ONE OF. AGENDA ITEMS ON CAPITOL HILL THIS MORNING INCLUDING HOUD LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS, A RAIL STRIKE ON PAID LEAVE AND A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. RYAN NOBLES, A BUSY DAY. LOOKING FORWARD TO A BUSY WEEK HERE.  Reporter: MAY BE A BUSY MONTH, WILLIE. A LOT CONGRESS HAS TO GET DONE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS. YOU'RE RIGHT. HEADLINE TODAY, THE HISTORIC ELECTION OF A NEW CROP OF DEMOCRATIC LEADERS LED BY NEW YORK CITY'S HAKEEM JEFFRIES. THE FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN TO BECOME LEADER ON ANY CAPITOL HILL POSITION, HOUSE OR SENATE. ELECTED BY PEERS IN A CLOSED-DOOR MEETING THIS AFTERNOON. PETE AGUILAR OF CALIFORNIA WILL BECOME THE CONFERENCE CHAIR. STILL HANGING AROUND, THOUGH, JIM CLYBURN, SERVING IN A ROLE IN LEADERSHIP. WHAT YOU SEE HERE, WILLIE, IS TRULY A CHANGE, A GENERATIONAL CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP. THIS NEW CROP. THREE NEW LEADERS, ARE 30 YEARS YOUNGER THAN THE GROUP THEY'RE GOING TO REPLACE IN HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI, STENY HOYER AND JAMES CLYBURN, TOP THREE SPOTS. THIS SHOWS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY EVOLVING GETTING TO THIS NEXT STEP AND, OF COURSE, A BIG JOB OF HAKEEM JEFFRIES TO KEEP ALL DEMOCRATS IN LINE GIVEN THE FACT SUCH TIGHT MARGINS IN THE HOUSE OF REPETITIVES IN THE COMING YEAR EVEN THOUGH DEMOCRATS ARE IN THE MINORITY. A LOT TO TACKLE RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE. YOU MENTIONED A LOOMING GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO PASS A CONTINUING RESOLUTION THAT ESSENTIALLY KICKS THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD OR DO FULSOME OMNIBUS SPENDING PLAEN TO GET BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO BUY INTO, AND THEN, OF COURSE, THERE IS THE RAIL STRIKE, WHICH IS A BIG PROBLEM RIGHT NOW FOR THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH TODAY IS A BILL THAT WILL ESSENTIALLY, YOU KNOW, APPROVE THE DEAL THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY ALREADY IT WITH THE UNIONS AND WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND THE RAIL COMPANIES, BUT THEY ARE ALSO GOING TO DO A SEPARATE VOTE ON OFFERING PAID SICK LEAVE TO MANY OF THESE RAIL WORKERS. THAT'S A KEY STICKING POINT AND SOMETHING THAT PROGRESSIVES ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF, BUT DOING TWO SEPARATE VOTES IN THE HOUSE TODAY SO THEY CAN GET IT OVER THE FINISH LINE AND SEE IF IT HAS THE VOTES TO GET IT DONE HERE IN THE SENATE. A VERY, VERY BUSY DAY HERE JUST AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE EXPECT IS GOING TO TAKE PLACE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.  RYAN, ALSO, THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE FINAL REPORT. ANY WORD ON WHEN THAT'SES GOING TO COME OUT AND WHO ELSE THEY STILL NEED TO TALK TO IN THE SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY HAVE?  Reporter: YEAH. IT'S CRAZY HOW BUSY THEY STILL ARE, MIKA. IN FACT, WE REPORTED FOR, AMONG THE FIRST TO REPORT THAT ROBIN VOS, THE ASSEMBLY SPEAKER IN WISCONSIN IS SCHEDULED TO MEET WITH THE COMMITTEE TODAY. HE, OF COURSE, WAS THE LEADER IN WISCONSIN, GOT A PHONE CALL FROM DONALD TRUMP 20 MONTHS AFTER THE ELECTION WAS CERTIFIED, WHERE TRUMP WAS DEMANDING HE RETROACTIVELY ATTEMPT TO OVERTURN ELECTION RESULTS AND VOS TURNED HIM DOWN. TOLD HIM HE CON DO THAT. WHILE VOS HAD THAT PROFILE ENCOURAGED SPENT $700,000 IN TAXPAYER MONEY TO INVESTIGATE THE ELECTION IN WISCONSIN AND TURNED UP NO FRAUD. WHERE WRAP THIS UP, TO YOUR QUESTION. STATUTE, HAVE TO BE DONE BY DECEMBER 21st. BENNIE THOMPSON SAID THEY'RE ALMOST READY TO PUT PENS DOWN, EIGHT CHAPTERS IN LENGTH. A TON OF INFORMATION. KEEP IN MIND, MIKA AND JOE, TOLD US FROM THE VERY BEGINNING, YES, ISSUE A REPORT THAT OUTLINES EVERYTHING, POINTS TO ALL THE KEY THINGS THEY DISCOVERED BUT ALSO GOING TO RELEASE ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THEY'VE COMPILED. EVERY DEPOSITION. EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT THEY'VE COLLECTED.  WOW.  Reporter: THIS IS GOING TO BE A TROVE OF INFORMATION. MUCH OF WHICH WE STILL DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL ULTIMATELY RELEASE.  ALL RIGHT.  NBC NEWS CAPITOL HILL CORRESPONDENT RYAN NOBLES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU, RYAN. REALLY APPRECIATE IT. > I WANT TO GO BACK QUICKLY ABOUT JOE BIDEN. SOMETHING YOU'VE ALWAYS SAID ABOUT HOW HE GET POLITICS. THIS GUY FROM DELAWARE THAT'S BEEN UNDERESTIMATED HIS ENTIRE LIFE. GETS POLITICS. HE WAS MOCKED, RIDICULED, AND JUST BLUNTLY LOATHED BY A PROGRESSIVE WHITE HOUSE.  UH-HUH.  WHEN HE WAS TOO PROGRESSIVE FOR THEIR TASTES ON MARRIAGE QUALITY. YOU LOOK BACK 2020, THAT PRESIDENTIAL FEEL FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION. HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED, HE WAS TOO OLD. HE WAS TOO SSENILE. ALL OF THESE PROGRESSIVES, THEY JUST LOOKED DOWN ON HIM. THEY FLAT-OUT LOOKED DOWN ON THIS GUY. HE WON. HE BEAT THEM ALL.  YEAH.  HISTORY HAS PROVEN HIM TO BE RIGHT. IT WAS THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE THAT WAS WRONG. I'M SURE THEY'RE ALL EMBARRASSED ABOUT HOW BADLY THEY TREATED JOE BIDEN TEN YEARS AGO, FOR HIM BEING RIGHT ON A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE. AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WERE WRITTEN ABOUT JOE BIDEN IN THE 2020 CAMPAIGN, THAT HE COULDN'T WIN. HE WASN'T UP TO IT. HE'S TOO OLD. HE BEAT EVERYBODY, AND THEN HE BEAT DONALD TRUMP, AND THEN YOU LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN 2022. EVERYBODY'S TURNING THAT RED WAVE, RED WAVE, RED WAVE, EXCEPT WE WEREN'T TALKING ABOUT A RED WAVE, AND HE -- HE OUT-PLAYS EVERYBODY'S EXPECTATIONS FOR HIM. IT SEEMS JUST ABOUT EVERY TIME.  HE KNOWS HIS POLITICS. HE KNOWS THE LONG GAME AND KNOWS HOW TO WALK THROUGH THE NAYSAYERS AND UNDERESTIMATING AND SORT OF PUT THE BLINDERS ON TO THAT AND MOVE FORWARD, AND WHETHER, YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK HOW HE'S HANDLING UKRAINE, WHICH IS JUST UNBELIEVABLY HUGE.  MASSIVE.  A HUGE ISSUE. AMERICANS TUNED IN THAT THAT, THEY'RE LESS SO BECAUSE OF THE DIVISION AND ISSUES THEY FACE HERE AT HOME AND THE ECONOMY, BUT AT THE MIDTERMS AGAIN FOCUSED ON ABORTION. HE FOCUSED ON DEMOCRACY. HE FOCUSED ON ABORTION. HE HELD A SPEECH ON THE STATE OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND RESTORING OUR DEMOCRACY. HE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE TOUCHPOINTS WERE, NO MATTER WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE WAS SAYING.  AND HE WAS, WILLIE, MOCKED AND RIDICULED, MOCKED AND RIDICULED FOR TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY, TALKING ABOUT ABORTION. I WON'T MENTION THE PODCAST, BUT I LISTEN TO A PODCAST, THE WEEK, WEEKEND BEFORE THE ELECTION. THE ENTIRE -- PEOPLE THAT EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS. THE ENTIRE PODCAST WAS MOCKING AND RIDICULING JOE BIDEN FOR FOCUSING ON ABORTION AND ON DEMOCRACY. HE ENDED UP BEING RIGHT. THEY ALL ENDED UP BEING WRONG.  CHECK THE EXIT POLLS IN PENNSYLVANIA. CHECK THE EXIT POLLS IN MICHIGAN, ANY, KNOW -- HE WASN'T ALONE IN BELIEVING THAT ABORTION WAS GOING TO BE A PERSISTENT ISSUE BUT A NARRATIVE FORMED RED HOT IN THE SUMMER AND KIND OF DIED DOWN. MOST PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT IT WAS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE KNEW THAT WASN'T THE CASE AND TURNED OUT TO BE DECISIVE IN A COUPLE OF THOSE STATES WHERE GOVERNORS WERE ELECTED AND SECRETARY OF STATES ELECTED, ESPECIALLY IN MICHIGAN BECAUSE OF OPPONENTS ON THE ISSUE OF ABORTION. > STILL AHEAD WE'RE GOING TO TALK TO A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF THE OATH KEEPERS ABOUT THE CONVICTIONS OF THE FAR-RIGHT GROUP'S FOUNDER. > PLUS, A POTENTIALLY GAME-CHANGING DRUG FOR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS.

        "trs": "MORE THAN HALF 1 MILLION GEORGIANS HAVE ALREADY VOTED IN THE STATES UPCOMING SENATE RUNOFF, INCLUDING A RECORD BREAKING 300,000 VOTERS ON MONDAY. WHICH IS JUST THREE DAYS OF EARLY VOTING REMAINING BEFORE NEXT WEEK'S RUNOFF ELECTION, WARNOCK EMPHASIZED TODAY THAT NOW IS NOT THE TIME SHE COMFORTABLE.  I AM HEARTENED BY THE ROBUST TURNOUT THAT WE ARE SEEING, BUT I DO NOT WANT US TO GET TOO COMFORTABLE. THESE ELECTIONS TEND TO BE VERY CLOSE, EVERY VOTE COUNTS. AND SO FOR EVERY VOTE -- FOR EVERY PERSON WHO IS SHOWING, UP THERE I'VE GOT THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE IN THEIR CIRCLE HAVE NOT SHOWN UP YET AND THEY NEED TO SHOW. UP  JOINING US NOW IS NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER MAYA KING. MAYA, GOOD TO SEE YOU. I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE HERSCHEL WALKER CAMPAIGN STRATEGY AT THIS POINT. WHAT IS THE PATH TO VICTORY TO LOOK LIKE? IT WAS QUITE MOTIVATING WHEN IT LOOKED LIKE IT MIGHT BE ABOUT CONTROL OF THE SENATE, BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD HOLD THEIR NOSES AT THE SORT OF CHARACTER THAT HERSCHEL WALKER IS IN ORDER TO WIN CONTROL OF THE SENATE FOR THE REPUBLICANS, BUT THAT IS NOT HANGING IN THE BALANCE NOW SO WHAT IS THE BEST ARGUMENT FOR REPUBLICANS WHO ARE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE HERSCHEL WALKER?  WELL, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ALI AND YOU ARE RIGHT. THE STRATEGY NOW HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT MUDDLED AND MORE DIFFICULT TO GET ACROSS TO CONSERVATIVES. BUT, IT HAS NOT CHANGED. ESSENTIALLY, IT IS THAT HAVING A 50/50 SENATE IS A LOT MORE EASY FOR REPUBLICANS TO BE A STRONG ARM AGAINST JOE BIDEN'S LEGISLATIVE AGENDA THEN HAVING A 50 1:49. BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, THIS IS VERY MUCH A TURNOUT GAME. SO WHAT YOU ARE HEARING FROM REPUBLICANS,, PARTICULARLY TO THEIR BASE IS A MESSAGE TO THE NORTHERN GEORGIA, MORE CONSERVATIVE BASE VOTERS. THE HERSCHEL WALKER CAMPAIGN HAS GOT A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO TRY TO MAKE INROADS WITH A FEW OF THE MODERATE CONSERVATIVES WHO DID NOT VOTE FOR HIM IN THE GENERAL. AT THIS STAGE, WITH A WEEK LEFT OF THE CAMPAIGNS, I THINK WE CANNOT DISCOUNT THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE TRIED THEIR BEST AND BEEN OUT SPENDER HERSCHEL WALKER ON THE AIRWAVES. THEY ARE NOW SPENDING ABOUT TWICE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY AND HAVE TWICE THE MOUNT OF ADVERTISEMENTS ON TV AND RADIO THEN REPUBLICANS. SO HERSCHEL WALKER AND HIS TEAM HAVE JUST DONE THEIR BEST AT THIS STAGE TO TURN OUT THEIR BASE. THE DIE HARD CONSERVATIVES WHO THEY KNOW WILL VOTE AND WHO WILL HAVE NO QUALMS ABOUT HIS PAST OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAS COME OUT, HOPING THAT WILL BE ENOUGH TO PUT HIM OVER THE TOP ONTO NUMBER SIX. WHAT AN INTERESTING FEW DAYS IS GONNA BE, MAYA, THANKS SO MUCH FOR GREAT REPORTING ON THIS. WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT, MAYA KING. JOINING US NOW IS NIKITA WILLIAMS, SHE'S THE CHAIR OF THE GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. GREAT TO SEE YOU AGAIN, THANKS FOR BEING WITH, US -- BUT MY WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS INTERESTING, BECAUSE IF HERSCHEL WALKER DOES, THIS U.S.'S BASE, OUT AND HE GETS EVERY LAST PERSON WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT IS PASSED OUT. HE DOESN'T GET AS MANY VOTES AS CAMPED IN THE ELECTION. IN OTHER WORDS, HERSCHEL WALKER LEADS CONSERVATIVES ON THE TABLE, HE LEAD SOME REPUBLICANS ON THE TABLE. AND IN ORDER TO WIN ON TUESDAY, HE'S GOT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE. AND HE'S GOTTA GET SOME OF THEM, HE'S GOT APPEAL TO, THEM THEM OUT OF THEIR HOUSES, AND GET THEM TO VOTE FOR HIM.  I KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE GETTING OUR VOTERS OUT, WE'VE SEEN IT IN THE MOTIVATION, AND THE LONG LINES WE'RE SEEING ACROSS THE STATE. WE ARE SHATTERING EARLY VOTE TURNOUT RECORDS. I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THE RECORD FROM YESTERDAY, THEN OF THE DAY TODAY, WE'VE BEEN SHATTERED YESTERDAY'S RECORD. WE ARE REGULARLY -- GEORGIANS UNDER STAND WITH THE STAKE IN THIS ELECTION. UNDERSTAND THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT WHO IS BEST. THIS IS ABOUT COMPETENCE AND CHARACTERS, AND THERE'S ONLY ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO CAN REPRESENT US.  SO FOR THOSE WHO ARE SWORN TO, GEORGIA AND GET EXPOSED TO AS MUCH AS ADVERTISED ON A DOOR KNOCKING HIS GEORGIANS WITH. WE'VE SEEN AN IMAGE OF PUSH A WALK OF THE STRESS HE WOULD BE INTERESTING'S UNITED STATES SENATOR FOR ELECTED. YOU THINK THAT'S THE OBVIOUS CONVERSATION, THE MORE HERSCHEL WALKER TALKS, AND THE MORE GEORGE ULISES CHURCH, WALKER THE BETTER IT IS FOR ROUGHLY WARNOCK. ONE OF SENATOR WARNOCK'S MOST RECENT ADS JUST HERSCHEL WALKER TALKING, BASICALLY.  WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HERSCHEL WALKER IS THE ONLY THING HE'S BEEN CLEAR ABOUT, IN THIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN, IS THAT HE WANTS A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN. HERSCHEL WALKER IS SIMPLY NOT READY, AND NOT FIT TO REPRESENT GEORGIA, AND THE U.S. SENATE. LOOK AT HIS PATTERN OF DISTURBING BEHAVIOR, HIS LIES, THE BIZARRE STATEMENTS, EVERYTHING THAT HE PUTS ON DISPLAY EVERY DAY. THAT IS NOT THE CHARACTER AND THE COMPETENCE, THEN WE NEED A NEW U.S. SENATOR, REPRESENTING US HERE IN GEORGIA.  WE SAID SUNDAY ABOUT TURNING DOWN A LOT OF VOTERS. WELL THIS RECORD BREAKING TURNOUT GRAND. WHEN I COME TO THE SAME WORLD A RECORD-BREAKING VOTING IS GOOD NO MATTER WHAT CASE. HOW DO YOU KNOW THERE ARE YOUR VOTERS?  WE ARE LOOKING AT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, LITERALLY SUED US AND TRY TO STOP US FROM HAVING SATURDAY VOTING IN THE STATE. I CERTAINLY FOR TWO HOURS IN MY DEEP BLUE DISTRICTS, AND ITS PERIWINKLE STATE. WE KNOW THAT GEORGIA IS A TRUE BATTLEGROUND STATE, BUT IN MY DISTRICT, THE FIFTH DISTRICT WAS WON REPRESENTED BY THE LATE CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS, AS FRONTLINE SATURDAY FOR TWO HOURS TO CAST MY VOTE. SOMETHING THAT THE REPUBLICANS IN HERSCHEL WALKER, DID NOT WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO. I AGREE WITH YOU, HAVING MORE ACCESS TO THE BALLOT IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING, WHICH IS WHY WE WENT TO COURT TO ALLOW US TO HAVE EARLY VOTING, AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO OPEN UP MORE EARLY VOTING LOCATIONS ACROSS THE STATE. SO, THIS IS A GOOD THING FOR GEORGIANS, A GOOD THING FOR DEMOCRACY, AND WHEN WE SAY -- WE WOULD ONLY BE GOOD FOR GEORGIA, BUT FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.  TO OURS IS NOT, GREAT NOT THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD, WE'VE SEEN WORSE IN GEORGIA. WE DON'T WITH THAT? HOW DISPIRITING IS IT THAT IN 2022, IN GEORGIA, WE HAVE LONG LINES TO VOTE. -- IT'S UNFORTUNATE, BUT VOTERS ARE SHOWING UP INSIDE OF THE LAND LINES IN HURDLES. EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE, TO THE DOING IT ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT'S AT STAKE. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN SOMEONE TRIES TO TAKE AWAY YOUR ACCESS TO THE BALLOT BOX, IT SHOWS YOU THE POWER IN YOUR VOTE. GEORGIANS ARE EVEN MORE MOTIVATED TO GET OUT TO MAKE THEIR VOICES HEARD, AFTER ALL THE ATTEMPTS OF THE REPUBLICAN HERSCHEL WALKER TRIED TO DO TO MAKE IT HARDER. EVEN A UNANIMOUS DECISION BY THE STATE SUPREME COURT, WHERE ALL OF THE JUDGES ARE APPOINTED BY REPUBLICANS, THEY SIDED WITH THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA TO GIVE A SATURDAY BOARDING. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY APPEALED TO TAKE AWAY FROM US.  CONGRESSWOMAN CAMILLA WILLIAMS, COULD HAVE YOU, HERE THANK YOU FOR JOINING, US WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE. IT ACCUMULATES OF GEORGIA, BUT GO, WAY LAWRENCE IS UP NEXT. I'M SERIOUS. I'M SERIOUS. So I choose Neuriva Plus. 20221130035142.215|20221130035518.982",

CALL IT WILD, CALL IT ANGRY, ALL THOSE THINGS COMING TOGETHER AT A THE MEETING THAT HISTORICALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN SLEEPY. BUT IN MARICOPA COUNTY, ELECTION DENIERS CAME OUT IN FORCE FURIOUS THAT ELECTION OFFICIAL WHO IS THEY INSIST, WITHOUT PROOF BY THE WAY, WERE STILLING THEIR VOTES.  THR A WAR BETWEEN GOOD AND EVIL. AND YOU ALL REPRESENT EVIL, INCLUDING YOU.  PLUS A LITTLE HOME RUN AN HOUR AGO, THE HIGHEST RANKING REPUBLICAN TALKING ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S DINNER WITH A WHITE SUPREMACIST. WE'LL HEAR FROM KEVIN McCARTHY AND ASK ABOUT ALL THE REPUBLICANS WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM. > AND FINALLY, IT'S WIN OR GO HOME FOR TEAM USA AND IRAN IN THE HUGE WORLD CUP MATCH LESS THAN AN HOUR AWAY. THE STAKES GO FAR BEYOND THE GAME. WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE ON THAT LATER IN THE SHOW. > WE BEGIN WITH A JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE TRYING TO NAIL DOWN THE FACTS SURROUNDING ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC AND HIGHLY DISPUTED STORIES FROM THAT DAY. THAT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP DEMANDED TO BE DRIVEN TO THE CAPITOL AND LUNGED A THE A SECURITY DETAIL WHEN TOLD HE COULDN'T GO. NBC NEWS LEARNED THE COMMITTEE IS BRINGING IN TONY ORNATO FOR A SECOND ROUND OF TESTIMONY TODAY. YOU MIGHT REMEMBER HE'S THE ONE WHO CASSIDY HUTCHINSON SAID TOLD HER A ABOUT THAT INCIDENT, WHICH SHE RECOUNTED DURING BOMB SHELL TESTIMONY IN JUNE.  I LOCKED AT TONY. HE SAID, DID YOU F'ing HEAR WHAT HAPPENED? I SAID, NO, I JUST GOT BACK. WHAT HAPPENED? TONY PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THE PRESIDENT SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF I'M THE F'ing PRESIDENT. TAKE ME UP TO THE CAPITOL NOW. TO WHICH BOBBY RESPONDED, SIR, WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE WEST WING. THE PRESIDENT REACHED UP TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE VEHICLE TO GRAB AT THE STEERING WHEEL. HE GRABBED HIS ARM AND SAID, SIR, YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR HAND OFF THE STEERING WHEEL. WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE WEST WING. WE'RE NOT GOING TO THE CAPITOL. MR. TRUMP THEN USED HIS FREE HAND TO LUNG TOWARDS BOBBY ANGLE, AND WHEN HE HE ARE RECOUNTED THE STORY TO HE, HE HAD MOTIONED TOWARDS HIS CAV CALLS.  I WANT TO BRING IN RYAN NOBLES ON CAPITOL HILL AND BARBARA McQUAID, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY AND AN MSNBC LEGAL ANALYST. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE. RYAN, WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT FROM ORNATO'S TESTIMONY? WHAT DIDN'T THEY GET FROM HUM THE FIRST TIME AROUND? IS IT JUST ABOUT THAT INCIDENT THAT WE HEARD DESCRIBED THERE, OR COULD THERE BE MORE TO IT?  THEY CERTAINLY WANT CLARITY AS TO WHAT CASSIDY HUTCHINSON TOLD THAT COMMITTEE UNDER OATH THIS A PUBLIC SETTING YOU'LL HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND, HIS FIRST DEPOSITION WITH THE COMMITTEE CAME WELL BEFORE HUTCHENSON'S TESTIMONY. THE FACT HE MAY BE CONTRADICTING WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY OR THERE WAS PUSHBACK, IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE WANTS TO CLEAR UP. THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING. THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS VERY CLOSE TIES TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT, INCLUDING SERVING AS HIS DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF TAKING A LEAVE OF ABSENCE TO DO THAT. SO HE'S SOMEONE WITH UNIQUE INSIGHT NOT ONLY TO THE PRESIDENT'S PROTECTION AND DETAIL AND THE WAY THAT WORKS, BUT ALSO WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THE WHITE HOUSE ASK IN THE WEST WING LEADING UP TO JANUARY 6th AND ON THAT DAY AS WELL. THERE'S ONE OTHER IMPORTANT POINT. THAT'S THAT MANY MEMBERS OF THE JANUARY 6th SELECT COMMITTEE TOLD US AFTER CASSIDY HUTCHINSON'S TESTIMONY THAT TONY WAS NOT TRUTHFUL WITH THEM THE FIRST TIME THEY TALKED TO HIM. SO THIS HAD IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO CLEAR UP ANY INACCURACIES THAT MAY HAVE HAPPENED AND KEEP IN MIND, HE'S TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE. IT'S AGAINST THE LAW TO LIE TO A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE. SO HE WILL ESSENTIALLY BE UNDER OATH AS THIS DEPOSITION TAKES PLACE TODAY.  WE ALSO KNOW THE CLOCK IS TICKING. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL NARRATIVE, THE STORY THIS COMMITTEE WANTS TO TELL IN THE FINAL REPORT DUE THE AT THE END OF THE YEAR, WHY WOULD IT BE IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED INSIDE THAT MOTORCADE?  WELL, I THINK IF YOU PUT TOGETHER WHAT CASSIDY HUTCHINSON TOLD US ASK WHAT WE ALSO SAW IN SOME OF THE OTHER TESTIMONY, IT SEEMED TO CONNECT THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS PLANNING A SECOND RALLY AT THE SUPREME COURT STEPS, WHICH IS RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE CAPITOL. THAT WOULD PUT HIM MORE CLSELY ALIGNED TO THE PHYSICAL ATTACK. ALL WE KNOW IS HE GAVE A FIRE ARE YOU SPEECH, BUT THERE'S SOME SUGGESTION THAT HE ALSO PLANNED A SECOND RALLY THAT WOULD PUT HIM THERE AND LINK HIM TO THIS PHYSICAL ATTACK. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TIE THAT UP. WAS THAT PART OF THE PLAN. REMEMBER HUTCHINSON ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW SHE GOT THAT CALL FROM KEVIN McCARTHY SAYING, WHY ARE YOU COMING TO THE CAPITOL? RUDY GIULIANI TELLING HER IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT WHEN HE COMES INTO THE CAPITOL SO TRY YUM TANT. PUTTING THAT TOGETHER IS STILL MISSING. THIS TESTIMONY COULD PUT IT TAILGATE OR DEBUNK IT.  THE THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE HEARD FROM MEMBERS OF THE SECRET SERVICE, WHO IN FACT, DISPUTED WHAT CASSIDY HUTCHINSON HAS TO SAY. BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT. THIS IS UNDER OATH AND UNDER PENALTY OF LAW.  THAT'S RIGHT. AND I THINK THAT CASSIDY HUTCHINSON TOLD A COMPELLING STORY. IF IT'S TRUE, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. BUT SHE HERSELF ADMITTED WHAT SHE HEARD WAS SECOND OR THIRD HAND INFORMATION. TONY ORR NA TO WAS PRESENT, SO HE CAN UNDER OATH TELL WHETHER THIS HAPPENED OR DIDN'T HAPPEN. CAN UNDER OATH TELL WHETHER THIS HAPPENED OR DIDN'T HAPPEN. HE SAID I HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO TELL THE TRUTH TO THE MEDIA. IT'S A DIFFERENT THAN TO TELL A STORY UNDER OATH. THIS IS A PLACE WHERE WE CAN EXPECT THE COMMITTEE TO BE ABLE TO PROBE THE DETAILS OF THIS INCIDENT TO TRY TO PIN DOWN WHAT HAPPENED.  AND THIS COMES A DAY AFTER KELLI ANN CONWAY TESTIFIED. SHE LEFT BACK IN AUGUST OF 2020. SO WHAT DID THE COMMITTEE WANT TO LEARN FROM HER?  SHE STILL IS SOMEONE WHO HAD CLOSE ACCESS TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT. SHE WAS ALSO SOMEONE THAT OUTLINED IN HER OWN MEMOIR COUNSELLED THE PRESIDENT HE DID NOT WIN THE ELECTION.  WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO COME HERE TODAY?  BECAUSE I WAS ASKED TO.  YOU WERE TOLD TO?  WHAT CONVERSATIONS DID YOU HAVE WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP OR OTHER PEOPLE IN HIS ORBIT DURING THE JANUARY 6th ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL?  WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I I MAY HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT HERE.  SO SHE OBVIOUSLY WASN'T THAT FORTH COMING ABOUT HER TESTIMONY, BUT WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THE TIMING OF ALL OF THIS. THEY DIDN'T SUBPOENA KELYANNE CONWAY. IT REALLY DID NOT HAPPEN UNTIL THE 11th HOUR. THE COMMITTEE HAS TO 23I7BISH THEIR FINAL REPORT IN JUST THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS BECAUSE ONCE REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL OF THE MAJORITY, IT'S LIKELY THIS COMMITTEE GOES AWAY. SO THEY MUST HAVE FELT THERE WAS SOMETHING IMPORTANT THAT CONWAY HAD TO SHARE THAT THEY WANT WANTED TO BE IN THE FINAL REPORT.  THANK YOU BOTH. NOW TO THAT WILD SCENE IN ARIZONA WHERE A LAST-MINUTE ATTEMPT TO DISRUPT THE ELECTION PROCESS IN MARICOPA COUNTY SAW RESIDENTS, INCLUDING SUPPORTERS OF DEFEATED CANDIDATE KARI LACK, ATTACK THE BOARD OF SUPERPROVIDERS AS THEY MET TO CERTIFY THE RESULTS.  I CAME HERE TODAY TO GET AN UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL LOOK AT THE SEVEN TRAITORS TO THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION FOR SITTING AT THAT DESK.  THIS WHOLE THING WAS A SHAM. YOU'RE VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION. YOU'RE VIOLATING OUR RIGHTS. WHERE'S YOUR AUTHORITY? WHO DIED AND MADE YOU KING?  WHAT WE SAW ON ELECTION DAY WAS OUTRAGEOUS. TO SAY IT WAS ANYTHING BUT THAT IS EITHER YOU THINK WE'RE STUPID OR YOU'RE JUST THAT ARROGANT.  THE WAY THAT YOU CAN JUST SIT THERE, IT'S DISGUSTING. WATCHING YOU PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO MY FLAG WAS DISGUSTING THE WAY THAT YOU SOLD US OUT.  A LOT OF FING IR POINTING, BUT THE ATTEMPT FAILED. THERE'S NO PROOF OF ANY OF THEIR ACCUSATIONS. SO MARICOPA COUNTY CERTIFIED THE RESULTS ANY WAY JUST AHEAD OF THE MONDAY AFTERNOON DEADLINE. IT WAS A DIFFERENT STORY IN COCHISE COUNTY. THEY ARGUED WITHOUT EVIDENCE THERE WERE ISSUES WITH THE COUNTY'S VOTING MACHINES. VAUGHN HILLYARD IS IN GEORGIA, BUT BEFORE OF THAT, HE FOLLOWED THE ARIZONA ELECTION FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS. ALSO WITH ME IS ELENA BEVERLY, FORM VOTING RIGHTS ATTORNEY. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHERE THINGS STAND WITH ARIZONA'S CERTIFICATION RIGHT NOW.  Reporter: RIGHT. SO MUCH OF THIS ARE THE SPROUTS FROM THE SEEDS THAT WERE LAID FOLLOWING THE 2020 ELECTION. THE FOLKS YOU HEARD THERE THAT WENT BEFORE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, THERE WERE QUESTIONS FROM THE COCHISE BOARD BEFORE ELECTION DAY SUGGESTING THAT THE TABULATING MACHINES WERE NOT TO BE TRUSTED. OF COURSE, THAT'S SO MUCH IN LARGE PART STEMS FROM 2020. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THE TABULATING MACHINES WERE NOT WORKING PROPERLY. AND IN FACT, THEY WERE TESTED REPEATEDLY AHEAD OF TIME AND THE MACHINES, BY ALL ACCOUNTS, WORKED AS THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO. YET WHERE WE ARE NOW IS THAT 14 OF THE 15 COUNTIES YESTERDAY MET THE STATUTORY DEADLINE TO CERTIFY THE ELECTION, BUT ONE OF THEM DID NOT. THE IRONY OF THIS IS THAT IT IS HEAVILY REPUBLICAN DISTRICT THAT VOTED FOR THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES PERCENTAGE POINTS. WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE LAWSUIT FILED, THERE WAS THE DEMOCRAT, SECRETARY OF STATE, HER OFFICE FILED THE LAWSUIT MAKING THE CASE THAT THEY ARE COMPELLED TO CERTIFY THE ELECTIONS PER ARIZONA STATE STATUTE. THERE'S ANOTHER STATE STATUTE THAT SAYS THAT IF BY THE DECEMBER 8th DEADLINE, WHICH IS NEXT WEEK, IN WHICH THE STATE OF ARIZONA, THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND ATTORNEY GENERAL ARE OBLIGATED TO CERTIFY, NOT ALL COUNTY CERTIFIED THEM, THAT ONE COUNTY'S VOTERS WILL NOT COUNT. SO IF THAT WERE THE CASE, THE BIG IMPLICATION IS U.S. HOUSE DISTRICT 6 IN ARIZONA WHERE THE REPUBLICAN NARROW HIS OPPONENT. IF YOU WERE TO ELIMINATE THE SHARE OF COCHISE COUNTY VOTES, THERE'S A 13,000-VOTE SWING, WHICH WOULD HAND THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE THE VICTORY. IT'S HARD TO FATHOM THAT TAKING PLACE, BUT RIGHT NOW, COME NEXT WEEK THE ARIZONA GOVERNOR'S SECRETARY OF STATE AND ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD BE OBLIGATED TOER IS IF I THE RESULTS WITHOUT THAT COUNTY. IT'S UP TO THE SUPERIOR COURT TO HEAR THIS CASE OUT.  WHEN YOU LOOK AT KARI LAKE, THE DAY IN COCHISE COUNTY IS DELAYING IN A COUNTY THAT SHE WON. BIG. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE STRATEGY OR WHAT SHE AND HER SUPPORTERS THINK THEY CAN ACCOMPLISH HERE.  I THINK AS VAUGHN MENTIONED, THIS IS VERY DEEPLY ROOTED IN THE APPROACH THAT DONALD TRUMP TOOK TO 2020 TO MAKE CLAIMS OF FRAUD TORKS MAKE SPECIOUS CLAIMS OF ELECTION DENIAL U. THE NEW STRATEGY IF YOU'RE AN EXTREMIST AND CAN'T WIN, YOU TRY TO GET INDIVIDUAL ELECTION ADMINISTRATORS TO TAKE THE ACTION THEMSELVES TO MUCK UP THE MACHINERY OF THE PROCESS. WE SAW THIS IN 2020. THEY TRIED TO REFUSE THE WAYNE COUNTY VOTE. WE'RE SEAING THIS NOW IN COCHISE COUNTY. WE SAW THIS IT IN PENNSYLVANIA. IT IS WELCOMEING A NEW PAT HERB FOR THE MORE EXTREMIST RIGHT ARM OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IF YOUR CANDIDATE DOES NOT WIN, TO MANIPULATE OR TRY TO MUCK UP THE ELECTION ADMINISTRATION PROCESS. THAT'S WHAT KARI LAKE TRIED TO DO AND THIS IS WHAT'S STARTING TO HAPPEN ACROSS THE BOARD IN A LARGER PATTERN. IT'S PART AND PARCEL PART OF THE SPECTRUM OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING WITH ALSO THOSE VOTERS WHO WENT AND HAD THAT MEETING IN MARICOPA COUNTY. IT'S PART OF THE SPECTRUM. IT'S SUGGESTING THE ELECTION ADMINISTRATION DOES NOT WORK. WHEN THE EXTREMIST PARTS ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MAKING THE ELECTION BEHIND STRAGS NOT WORK.  SO LET ME ASK YOU BOTH THE SAME QUESTION BRIEFLY, IF I CAN. ONE IS A REPORTER, ONE AS SOMEONE THAT'S BEEN A POLITICAL INSIDER. ARE DEMOCRATS JUST SITTING BACK RIGHT NOW LOOKING AT KARI LAKE AND THAT MEETING WITH ALL THE YELLING AND FINGER POINTING AND SAYING, GO AHEAD, IMPLODE.  THIS IS A SITUATION THAT WE FEARED HERE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT METASTASIZES, NOT ONLY ON THE RIGHT FUELLED BY DONALD TRUMP, BUT THOSE ON THE LEFT OR DOWN THE MIDDLE, WHO BECOME QUESTIONING OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE, LIKE FOR INSTANCE, TARVEGED WITH CERTIFYING THE RESULTS. AS BILL GATES SAID HIMSELF, MAIR COAT PA COUNTY'S ELECTION WAS NOT PERFECT. THERE WAS SOME MACHINES THAT, IN FACT, WERE NOT PRINTING OFF ENOUGH INK. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WASN'T A SAFE ELECTION. VOTERS WERE THEN TOLD TO PLACE THEM IN A BOX BEFORE THEY WERE TRANSPORTED TO DOWNTOWN PHOENIX TO BE COUNTED IN THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED. BY ALL ACCOUNTS, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. BUT WHEN VOTERS SHOW UP TO THE POLLING LOCATIONS, THEY ARE TOLD TO BELIEVE IT'S A CONSPIRACY THEORY AT PLAY HERE AND THEY ARE TOLD TO BELIEVE THAT THE VOTING MACHINES ARE HIJACKED AND MEANT TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME. THEY WALK INTO THESE VOTING CENTERS AND CREATE MORE CONSPIRACIES, WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING PLAY OUT NOW.  DO DEMOCRATS THINK THIS HELPS THEM?  DEMOCRATS DON'T THINK INSECURITY ABOUT THE ELECTION HELPS THEM. WHAT THEY ARE TRYING TO DO IS TAKE ON ELECTION DENIERS HEAD ON. WHICH WE SAW DURING THE MIDTERMS. WE SAW THAT THEY LOST IN SWING STATES. BECAUSE DEMOCRATS WERE TAKING THEM HEAD ON AND ALSO SAYING THAT NO MATTER WHAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE EVERY VOTE COUNTS, NO MATTER WHO YOU VOTE FOR. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THE PROCESS IS SAFE AND YOUR VOTE WILL COUNT. THE DEMOCRATS AREN'T TRYING TO GAME THE SYSTEM. THEY ARE TRYING TO WIN ON POLICY.  THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH. > IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES, THE U.S. AND IRAN GO HEAD TO HEAD ON THE WORLD CUP STAGE WITH A CHANCE TO ADVANCE TO THE KNOCKOUT ROUND ON THE LINE. BUT THE STAKES GO FAR BEYOND THAT AS POLITICAL BAD BLOOD BETWEEN THE NATIONS AND UNREST IN IRAN HAS CAST A SHADOW OVER THE MATCHUP.

THE PRESIDENT IS CALLING ON CONGRESS TO QUICKLY APPROVE A LABOR DEAL REACHED IN SEPTEMBER.

THREE YEARS INTO THE PANDEMIC, THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT STRICT POLICIES LED TO THOUSANDS RISING UP IN PROTEST. SUCH A RARE PUBLIC REBUKE OF THE PARTY COULD SLOW CRITICAL PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY FROM THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY.  CHINA IS ONE OF THE HOT POLITICAL TOPICS RAISED BUT POPE FRANCIS, WHO HAS BROKEN WITH TRADITION TO STEER CLEAR OF POLITICS. IN A RARE INTERVIEW, THE LEADER WEIGHED IN ON TWO OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUES OF THE DAY HERE IN THE U.S. POLITICAL POLARIZATION AND ABORTION. ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO LED THAT INTERVIEW IS THE EDITOR AND CHIEF OF AMERICA MAGAZINE AND A BRAND NEW MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR. IT'S YOUR FIRST TIME SIPS YOU BECAME A CONTRIBUTOR. WE'RE THRILLED TO HAVE YOU ON THE PROGRAM.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  YOU INTERVIEWED THE POPE LAST WEEK AT THE VATICAN. SOMETHING NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE CAN SAY. YOU ASKED HIM ABOUT PLIT POLARIZATION AND HE SAID, WHEN THERE'S POLARIZATION A DEVISIVE MENTALITY ARISES. THE MORE POLARIZATION, THE MORE ONE LOSES THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT AND FALL SBOS A SECTARIAN SPIRIT. WHAT WAS YOUR TAKE AWAY? WAS HE THINKING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES AND OUR POLITICAL POLARIZATION?  HE WAS ABSOLUTELY THINKING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES AND OUR POLITICAL POLARIZATION. HIS POINT WAS TWO-FOLD. FIRST, POLARIZATION IS REALLY BAD FOR ANY COUNTRY, BUT IT'S ESPECIALLY BAD IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S NOT HEALTHY FOR ANY DEMOCRACY. AND SECONDLY, IT'S REALLY, REALLY BAD WHEN THE CHURCH JUST PARTICIPATES IN THAT WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT. AND SO HE'S REALLY SENDING A SIGNAL TO AMERICAN CATHOLICS AND PARTICULARLY THE BY SHOPS THAT THEY NEED TO BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION HERE AND NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM.  THERE ARE SEPARATIONS BETWEEN BISHOPS. WE HAVE SEEN THAT IN A NUMBER OF ISSUES. THE POPE WAS ALSO ASKED ABOUT THIS DEEPLY POLARIZING ISSUE OF ABORTION. THIS A COUNTRY WITH A CATHOLIC PRESIDENT, THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IS CATHOLIC, 30% OF CONGRESS ARE CATHOLIC, DOES THE CHURCH HAVE INFLUENCE ON THE DEBATE? DO YOU THINK THE POPE BELIEVES THAT BISHOPS CAN LEAD IN THE DEBATE?  I THINK HE NOT ONLY BELIEVES THEY CAN BUT THEY SHOULD. BUT THEY SHOULD LEAD DIFFERENTLY THAN THEY HAVE BEEN. ONE OF THE THINGS THIS POPE HAS CONTINUALLY STRESSED IS THE IMPORTANCE OF SEEING THE PERSON THAT IS AT THE CENTER OF ALL THESE QUESTIONS. THAT'S ONE OF THE WAYS WE CAN DEPOLARIZE BY PERSONALIZING THE CONVERSATION. AND REMEMBERING THAT AT THE HEART OF THIS QUESTION ARE PEOPLE. USUALLY WOMEN IN CRISIS. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO KEEP OUR EYE ON. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO PRIORITIZE AS A CHURCH IN TERMS OF OUR RESPONSE. SO WHEN OUR BISHOPS OR WHEN PRIESTS ARE ACTING TO MUCH LIKE PO POLITICIANS, INSTEAD OF LIKE PRIESTS, WE GET INTO TROUBLE. WE BECOME PART OF THAT PROBLEM INSTEAD OF THE SOLUTION.  HE'S NOT SAYING ABORTION IS FINE. THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE. WHAT HE'S SAYING IS THE WAY WE APPROACH IT HAS TO CHANGE. HE WAS ASKED IF HE NEEDS TO CHANGE HIS APPROACH. WERE THERE THINGS THAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY OR HE REGRETS. HE SAID IN ENGLISH, ALL. POPES HAVE NOT SPOKEN THE WAY HE HAS EVER.  THAT'S RIGHT. THIS IS AN SBOIRLY NEW GENERA OF COMMUNICATION. NO ONE HAS SAT FOR A SINGLE INTERVIEW, LET ALONE AS MANY AS HE'S GIVEN. I THINK THIS IS WHEN PEOPLE LOVE ABOUT THIS POPE. HE'S HONEST. HE'S STRAIGHT FORWARD. HE SAYS IT LIKE IT IS. I KNOW WHAT WE BELIEVE. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS HAD TO BE APPLIED IN THE REAL WORLD. AND SOMETIMES I GET IT RIGHT AND SOMETIMES I GET IT WRONG.  FATHER MALONE, YOU AND I WILL COVER IF THERE'S ANOTHER CONCLAVE, MAY IT NOT BE SOON.  AMEN.  IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

        "trs": "WELCOME BACK TO POLITICSNATION. WE ARE GOING TO NOW TURN TO MY POLITICAL PANEL FOR THEIR ANALYSIS ON TODAY'S BIG TOPICS. JOINING ME AS DANA MILL BACK, POLITICAL COLUMNIST FOR THE WASHINGTON POST. AND, FORMER REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE CARLOS CURBELO OF FLORIDA. DANA, LET ME GO TO YOUR FIRST. TODAY GEORGIA VOTERS ARE HEADED TO THE POLLS TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS IN THE CRUCIAL SENATE RUNOFF BETWEEN DEMOCRAT INCUMBENT RAPHAEL WARNOCK AND REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER HERSCHEL WALKER. SOME WARNOCK IS ENTERING THE ELECTION WITH A HUGE CASH ADVANTAGE OF MORE THAN $20 MILLION. MEANWHILE, WALKER IS FIGHTING OFF REPORTS OF A SECOND WOMAN ACCUSING HIM OF PRESSURING HER TO HAVE AN ABORTION. ALLEGATIONS HE HAS DENIED. THIS WEEK, HE RELEASED A NEW CAMPAIGN AD TARGETING TRANSGENDER ATHLETES. DESPITE THE MASS SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED AT A GAY CLUB IN COLORADO SPRINGS DAYS BEFORE. WHICH SIDE IT HAS MORE MOMENTUM GOING INTO THE DECEMBER 6TH RUNOFF ELECTION, DANA?  WELL REVEREND, PREDICTIONS IN THE STAY IN HR WAYS PERILOUS BUT HERE IS ALL THE INFORMATION I THINK YOU NEED RIGHT NOW. REPUBLICANS WERE WORKING VERY HARD TO STOP PEOPLE FROM VOTING IN THIS ELECTION. THEY WENT TO, COURT WENT THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM TO TRY TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM VOTING ON THIS VERY DAY, IN FACT. AND THEY LOST THAT BATTLE. SO LET'S JUST SAY, WHEN YOU ARE CONFIDENT ABOUT YOUR PROSPECTS, THINGS ARE LOOKING GOOD IN THE ELECTION, GENERALLY YOU ARE NOT TRYING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM GOING OUT AND VOTING. SO, IT WOULD SEEM AT THIS POINT THAT THE MAIN REPUBLICAN CASE FOR SUPPORTING, HOLDING YOUR NOSE AND SUPPORTING HERSCHEL LOCKER WAS IF THE CONTROL OF THE SENATE WAS IN THE BALANCE. THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE. SO IT IS MORE A SITUATION OF DO YOU REALLY WANT SOMEONE LIKE HERSCHEL WALKER REPRESENTING YOU IN THE SENATE? THE ABORTION NEWS IS REALLY NOTHING NEW. IT'S RELATED MORE OF THE SAME. HIS TENDENCY TO JUST SPOUTED OFF AND SAY REALLY ANY THINGS IS RELIGIOUS MORE OF THE SAME. SO WE ARE JUST SEEING A LOT MORE OF THE SAME HERSCHEL WALKER, AND IT WOULD APPEAR THE REPUBLICANS AT LEAST ARE, BY THEIR ACTIONS TRYING TO LIMIT VOTING ARE PRETTY CONCERNED THAT IF GEORGIANS ACTUALLY GET OUT THERE VOTE THEIR MAN IS GOING TO GO DOWN.  CARLOS, THERE IS NEW FALLOUT FROM DONALD TRUMP'S PREVENT THANKSGIVING DINNER ON TUESDAY AT HIS MAR-A-LAGO CLUB WITH YE, OR YE. AND NICK FAYE WHEN FOR WINTERS. NICK FOR WINTERS IS HIS NAME, AN OUTSPOKEN ANTISEMITE AND RACIST WHO IS ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MOST NOTORIOUS YOUNG WHITE SUPREMACISTS. HE IS A HOLOCAUST DENIER, AND IS IT HELPING TO ADVISE YE IN HIS SECOND PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. TRUMP TOOK TO HIS SOCIAL PLATFORM TO CLAIM THAT HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT HIS VIEWS AND JUST MOMENTS AGO, THE WHITE HOUSE RELEASED A STATEMENT THAT READS IN PART, BIGOTRY, HATE, AND ANTISEMITISM HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PLACE IN AMERICA INCLUDING AT MAR-A-LAGO. HOLOCAUST IN IS REPUGNANT AND DANGEROUS AND MUST BE FORCEFULLY CONDEMNED. AND OF QUOTE. TRUMP IS JUST 11 DAYS INTO HIS THIRD CAMPAIGN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE SITUATION, AND IS THIS THE FIRST IN WHAT WILL NO DOUBT BE A LONG SERIES OF SELF INFLICTING SCANDALS IN HIS LATEST PRESIDENTIAL RUN?  TWO THINGS REV. NUMBER ONE, THIS IS YET ANOTHER REMINDER THAT DONALD TRUMP IS UNFIT FOR PUBLIC OFFICE, ALWAYS WAS, STILL IS AND WILL BE DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE IS ONCE AGAIN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT. NUMBER TWO, THIS SHOWS US HOW DESPERATE DONALD TRUMP IS FOR ATTENTION. ANYONE WHO WANTS TO GO SEE HIM, WHO WILL GIVE HIM SOME ATTENTION, IT WILL LISTEN TO HIM, HE WILL SIT DOWN WITH. AND AGAIN, THAT IS JUST UNHEALTHY. THAT IS UNFORTUNATE IN THIS CASE BECAUSE HE DID IT WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PROMOTING HATE AND BIGOTRY. SO THIS IS ALL JUST ANOTHER REMINDER OF WHO DONALD TRUMP IS, WHY HE WAS SO DANGEROUS FOR THE COUNTRY WHEN HE WAS IN OFFICE, AND WHY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT HE DOES NOT RETURN TO THE PRESIDENCY.  IT IS INTERESTING THAT HE DIDN'T ATTACK YE FOR BRINGING FOUR WINTERS TO DINNER WITH HIM. VERY INTERESTING,.  THAT IS BECAUSE YE SAYS NICE THINGS ABOUT HIM. FOR DONALD TRUMP, THE ONLY THING THAT IS IMPORTANT IS THAT YOU SUPPORT HIM AND SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT HIM. OTHER THAN THAT, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.  CARLOS, STICKING TO YOU. LET'S TURN TO YOUR STATE OF FLORIDA WHERE GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS IS GETTING MAJOR SUPPORT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. EARLIER, ELON MUSK SAID ON FRIDAY HE WOULD SUPPORT TO RON DESANTIS IN 2024 IF THE FLORIDA GOVERNOR WERE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. IS TO SANTAS READY FOR THE INTENSE FOCUS THAT IS GOING TO BE ON HIM AS TRUMP'S MAIN RIVAL NOW THE TRUMP IS A DECLARED CANDIDATE?  THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION, REV. WITHOUT A DOUBT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE UNITING AROUND DESANTIS. THEY VIEW HIM AS THE VESSEL TURNED UP TO TRUMP. THE CHALLENGE FOR DESANTIS IS THAT HE IS ESSENTIALLY GOING UP AGAINST HIS MENTOR. HE CAME UP TO THE TRUMP ARM SYSTEM. HE FOLLOWED THE TRUMP PLAYBOOK, AND NOW HE HAS TO CONVINCE THAT TRUMP BASE THAT THEY SHOULDN'T SUPPORT TRUMP ANYMORE. THAT THEY SHOULD SUPPORT HIM INSTEAD. SO HE IS GOING TO STAY QUIET HERE FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR. HE HAS A LEGISLATIVE SESSION COMING UP AT THE BEGINNING OF S TO D DANA, THIS WEEK PRESIDT BIDEN REITERATED HIS CALL TO BAN ASSAULT RIPENS. ASSOCIATED PRESS REPORTS, QUOTE, A WEAPONS BAN A CLOSELY DIVIDED CONGRESS. BUT BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY EMBOLDENED IN PUSHING FOR STRONGER GUN CONTROLS, AND DOING SO WITH NO CLEAR ELECTORAL CONSEQUENCES, AND QUOTE. HOW OPTIMISTIC ARE YOU THE DEMOCRATS CAN GET A BILL DONE IN THE LANE DUCK PERIOD?  WELL IT WOULD HAVE TO BE IN THE LATE DUCK PERIOD BECAUSE, CLEARLY EVEN IF THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A FOUR TO VOTE MAJORITY, THE ONLY WAY TO GET THAT THROUGH THE HOUSE WOULD BE WITH SOME KIND OF A DISCHARGE POSITION, AND THAT IS EXTREMELY UNLIKELY. LOOK, EVERY TIME PEOPLE HAVE BET AGAINST GUN CONTROL IN THE LAST DECADE OR SO, THEY HAVE COME OUT ON TOP. BECAUSE EVEN WHEN IT LOOKS GOOD, EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE HAD ONE HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AFTER ANOTHER, THE MOMENTUM EVENTUALLY FIZZLES. THE NRA AND ITS ALLIES EVENTUALLY TRIUMPH. SO IF DEMOCRATS WANT TO DO IT, THEY HAVE TO ACT QUICKLY. THE CALENDAR HOWEVER IS WORKING AGAINST THEM. SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO SAY IT IS UNLIKELY. BUT DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE DOING THIS, NOT BECAUSE THE POLITICS FAVORITE OR DON'T FAVORITE, BUT BECAUSE IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT WHAT TRAGEDY IS NOT EVEN EVERY WEEK, WE'RE SEEING THEM EVERY FEW DAYS.  THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING WITH US. NEXT, FOOTBALL IS A THANKSGIVING TRADITION FOR MANY AMERICANS. COMING UP, WE WILL TACKLE THE PERSISTENT LACK OF DIVERSITY AT THE HIGHEST RANKS OF NFL COACHING IN WAKE OF A SHOCKING NEW INVESTIGATION.

        "trs": " IF SENATE REPUBLICANS WANT TO ENTER THE NEW CONGRESS AT A SPLIT SENATE, AND MAINTAIN A POWER SHARING AGREEMENT, GIVING THEM EQUAL SAY ON COMMITTEES, THEY MUST GET GEORGIA VOTERS TO ELECT THIS MAN.  FIRST OF ALL, THIS ELECTION IS MORE THAN HERSCHEL WATER. THIS ELECTIONS ABOUT THE PEOPLE. AND I SAID WE THE PEOPLE, NOT WITH THE GOVERNMENT.  THAT WAS AN UNFORTUNATE MISPRONUNCIATION OF THE WORD ELECTION. ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING WALKERS CURRENT CONTROVERSIES, ASIDE FROM HERSCHEL WALKER'S MANY GAPS, NEW REPORTING SUGGEST THAT THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE IN GEORGIA COULD BE SHIFTING LESS THAN TWO WEEKS FROM THE SENATE RUNOFF. TODAY, THE GEORGIA SUPREME COURT REINSTATED A BAN ON ABORTIONS AFTER SIX WEEKS OF PREGNANCY. LESS THAN A WEEK AFTER A LOWER COURT OVERTURNED THAT BAN. MID EXIT POLLING DATA FROM MSNBC NEWS FOUND THAT AMONG DEMOCRATIC VOTERS IN GEORGIA, ABORTION WAS THE TOP ISSUE THE BROUGHT THEM TO THE POLLS. ADDITIONALLY, A MAJORITY OF GEORGIA VOTERS SAY THAT ABORTIONS SHOULD BE LEGAL. RAPHAEL WARNOCK, WHO IS ALSO A REVEREND, MADE ABORTION RIGHTS A CORE TENANT OF HIS CAMPAIGN, AND EARNED NEARLY 38,000 MORE VOTES THAN PARTIAL WALKER IN GEORGIA'S GENERAL ELECTION. ORGANIZERS IN GEORGIA ARE HOPING THAT VOTERS WILL AGAIN AWARD RAPHAEL WARNOCK MORE VOTES TO DEFEND REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN THE RUNOFF ELECTION. ONE GROUP REPRESENTING VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES RELEASED THIS ADVERTISEMENT THIS WEEK.  IT IS A SIMPLE CHOICE, REALLY. EITHER YOU AND I GET OUT TO VOTE TO PROTECT THE FREEDOMS THAT WE HAVE FOUGHT FOR, OR WE GET A SENATOR WHO WILL VOTE TO BAN ABORTION AT THE FIRST CHANCE HE GETS.  EARLY VOTING IN GEORGIA WILL START THIS SATURDAY IN AT LEAST 22 COUNTIES. GEORGIA'S REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE TRIED TO BLOCK THAT, BECAUSE OF A GEORGIA LAW THAT BARS SATURDAY VOTING IF THERE IS A HOLIDAY WITHIN TWO DAYS BEFORE IT. SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK AND GEORGIA'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY SUED, ARGUING THAT THAT RESTRICTION DID NOT APPLY TO RUNOFFS. THE COURTS AGREED. JOINING US NOW, NATASHA BROWN, COFOUNDER OF THE GEORGIA-BASED ORGANIZATION, THE BLACK VOTERS MATTER FUND. ALSO WITH US, STUART STEVENS, A VETERAN OF FIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS. HE IS A PRINCIPAL WITH RESOLUTE -- THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. NATASHA, BLACK VOTERS MATTER WAS ON THE GROUND IN GEORGIA TODAY, DISTRIBUTING FOOD AHEAD OF THANKSGIVING, STRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RUNOFF ELECTION. AS YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE IN THE CITY, DOES ENTHUSIASM FEEL HIGH?  ONE, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. WE HAVE BEEN ON THE GROUND, AND ARE HEARING FROM VOTERS, AND THEY ARE DETERMINED ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. WE ARE LOOKING AT HERSCHEL WALKER WITH SO MANY PEOPLE [INAUDIBLE] THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HERSCHEL WALKER, NOT ONLY BUT BEING EMBARRASSING. AND ALSO AS A [INAUDIBLE] I DON'T KNOW IF THE WORD, BUT PEOPLE ARE VERY RESOLUTE. THEY'RE GOING TO COME OUT AND VOTE, AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE [INAUDIBLE]  RESOLUTE AS THAT IS, THAT IS THE RIGHT WHERE. STUART, HOW DO YOU FEEL THIS RULING, REINSTATING THE STATES SIX-WEEK BAN ON ABORTION WILL IMPACT THIS RACE. AND CONVERSELY, HOW MOTIVATED ARE CONSERVATIVES TO COME OUT FOR WALKER, GIVEN THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ALREADY WON CONTROL OF THE SENATE?  THE WHOLE WALKER CANDIDACY WAS ABSURD. IN THE GENERAL ELECTION, HE GOT 200,000 FEWER VOTES THAN TEMPTED, AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET. THIS WAS JUST A BAD IDEA, IT'S SORT OF PLAYING ITSELF OUT INEVITABLY. I THINK THAT THE ONLY EXCUSE TO VOTE FOR WALKER, IF YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN WAS CONTROL OF THE SENATE. THAT IS GONE NOW. I DON'T THINK THIS WILL BE PARTICULARLY CREST, THE ONLY DANGER WOULD BE IF GEORGIA VOTERS THOUGHT THAT WARNOCK HAD IT IN THE BAG. ALL OF THE EFFORTS GOING ON ON THE GROUND WE'LL COUNTER THAT. I DON'T THINK IT'LL GET HIM THE VOTES.  AND NATASHA, SENATOR WARNOCK'S LATEST AD WAS ABOUT THANKSGIVING. LET'S PLAY SOME OF IT.  POLITICS THESE DAYS IS OFTEN USED TO DIVIDE US. THANKSGIVING OFFERS US AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONSIDER ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE SHARE IN COMMON. WE ALL WANT BETTER LIVES FOR OUR CHILDREN, WE ALL WANT TO LIVE IN SAFE AND SECURE COMMUNITIES. WE ALL WANT TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. LET'S PAUSE THIS THANKSGIVING, AND CELEBRATE OUR VALUES THAT INSPIRE US ALL.  NATASHA, THAT HAD MADE ZERO MENTION OF HERSCHEL WALKER OR THE RUNOFF ELECTION, AND ENDED WITH A PRAYER. HOW DO YOU FEEL THAT AD WILL PLAY AMONG GEORGIA VOTERS WHO LOCAL REPORTS SUGGEST HAVE BECOME FATIGUED AND ARE TIRED OF THE NONSTOP ATTACK ADS?  [INAUDIBLE] AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S OUR POLITICS. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS SENATOR WARNOCK MAKING A REAL HUMAN CONNECTION. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT HOW THE PEOPLE IN GEORGIA -- THIS IS NOT ABOUT A POLITICAL RACE. THIS IS ABOUT OUR POWER, INCLUDING A PERSON IN OFFICE MEETING IN AGENDA.  AND BEFORE WE GO, NEW REPORTING FROM THE TEXAS TRIBUNE BUT FOUND THAT HERSCHEL WALKER HAS BEEN CLAIMING ATTACKS IGNITION IN TEXAS THAT HE CAN ONLY QUALIFY FOR IF HE IS A PRIMARY RESIDENT OF TEXAS. WALKER TOOK THAT EXEMPTION THIS YEAR, EVEN AFTER LAUNCHING HIS SENATE BID. MSNBC REACHED OUT FOR A COMMENT, BUT HAS NOT RECEIVED A RESPONSE. MY QUESTION TO YOU, STEWART, DO YOU THINK THAT AT THIS POINT IN THE RACE, THAT DEVELOPMENT WILL HAVE ANY IMPACT, WHETHER LEGALLY OR POLITICALLY ON HERSCHEL WALKER'S CANDIDACY?  IN THIS RUNOFF, AT THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, WE WANT TO WIN EVERY DAY, AND THE FACT THAT IT COMES, OUT WE DON'T REALLY LIVE IN THE STATE WERE RUNNING FOR, -- YOU JUST HAVE TO MENTION, WHAT WAS IT LIKE IN THE ROOM? WE SHOULD GET HERSCHEL WALKER TO RUN FOR THE SENATE OF GEORGIA. IT IS A RIDICULOUS IDEA, NOBODY IN THE U.S. SENATE -- IF HE DID GET ELECTED, WHATEVER, SAY I'M GOING TO ASK HERSCHEL WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT THIS ISSUE. GEORGIA HAS HAD TREMENDOUS SENATORS IN THE PAST, AND THEY HAVE TWO GREAT SENATORS NOW. I THINK THAT THAT AD BY WARNOCK WAS TERRIFIC. HE IS A VERY GOOD ADVERTISERS, RUNNING A VERY GOOD CAMPAIGN. AND SO I THINK THAT THIS IS ONE WHERE THE BETTER CANDIDATE RUNNING THE BETTER KICK CAMPAIGN IS GOING TO WIN IT.  WE'LL FIND OUT FOR SURE ON DECEMBER 6TH. NATASHA BROWN, STUART STEVENS, THANK YOU BOTH AS ALWAYS. NANCY PELOSI HAS LONG BEEN A TRAIL BLAZER ON LGBTQ RIGHTS.

WE NOW HAVE TO BREAKING NEW ELECTION CALLS. NBC NEWS JUST PROJECTED THAT REPUBLICAN SENATOR LISA -- THERE IS THE MUSIC, WITH PUBLIC AND SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI HAS WON REELECTION. AND DEMOCRAT MARY PELTOLA IS THE WINNER OF THE AT LARGE CONGRESSIONAL SEAT. NOW, CONGRESSMAN PELTOLA, THE FIRST INDIGENOUS ALASKAN TO SERVE IN CONGRESS, DEFEATED. FORMER GOVERNOR AND REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE SARAH PALIN WITH NEARLY 55% OF THE VOTE. THAT IS A LIVE STREAM, I IMAGINE, OF THE RANKED CHOICE VOTING THAT THEY BEAM OUT TO THE WORLD AS THEY TABULATE THERE. THE ALASKA -- ELECTIONS. THIS HAS BEEN ANOTHER NOT-SO-GREAT RUN UP TO THANKSGIVING FOR PALIN, 14 YEARS AFTER HER INFAMOUS TURKEY PARDONING GAFFE, WITH A WEAK STOMACH, YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK AWAY.  OH, WELL THIS WAS NEAT. I WAS HAPPY TO GET TO BE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS, AND, YOU KNOW. FOR ONE, YOU NEED A LITTLE BIT OF LEVITY IN THIS JOB, ESPECIALLY WITH SO MUCH THAT HAS GONE ON IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS THAT HAS BEEN SO POLITICAL, OBVIOUSLY. IT IS NICE TO GET OUT AND DO SOMETHING TO PROMOTE A LOCAL BUSINESS AND JUST PARTICIPATE IN SOMETHING THAT ISN'T SO HEAVY-HANDED POLITICS. THAT INVITES CRITICISM. CERTAINLY WE ARE GETTING CRITICISM FOR EVEN DOING THIS TOO, BUT THIS WAS FUN.  NOW, ON A SERIOUS, NOTE THIS IS ALL HAPPENING NOW, TWO WEEKS AFTER THE ELECTION, BECAUSE ALASKA HAS GOT THIS NEW VOTING SYSTEM, ALASKA VOTERS NOW RANK UP TO FOUR CANDIDATES IN EACH RACE INSTEAD OF USING ONLY ONE. IF NO CANDIDATE RECEIVES THE 50% PLUS ONE OF THE VOTE, AS WAS THE CASE IN THE LAST ACT CONGRESSIONAL -- MOVE ON TO COUNT THE VOTERS SECOND CHOICES.  THE CANDIDATE WHO GETS THE LEAST NUMBER OF FIRST CHOICE BOATS IS ELIMINATED. THEN, TABULATION STARTS IN ROUNDS. IF YOU ARE FIRST CHOICE WAS NOT ELIMINATED, YOUR VOTE STAYS WITH THEM AND GETS COUNTED IN THE NEXT ROUND. IF YOUR FIRST CHOICE WAS ELIMINATED, YOUR SECOND CHOICE IS NOW COUNTED. THIS KEEPS HAPPENING IN ROUNDS UNTIL TWO CANDIDATES ARE LEFT. AND THE ONE WITH THE MOST VOTES WINS.  A BUNCH OF PLACES USE THIS, MAIN USE, IT NEW YORK CITY ACTUALLY USED IT FOR ITS PRIMARY HERE. TONIGHT, THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED FOR DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN MARY PELTOLA WHO WILL SERVE IN THIS NEXT CONGRESS IN THE SEAT FORMERLY HELD BY DON YOUNG, FOR THIS MOMENTOUS NIGHT OF RANCH CHOICE. -- OPINION COLUMNIST FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES. IT'S AN AMAZING TRAJECTORY FOR SARAH PALIN. YOU AND I ARE STILL IN THE SAME AGE COHORT, RIGHT? WE BOTH COVERED THAT RACE IN 2008. AND SHE WAS LIKE A SHOOTING STAR THAT LIT UP THE NIGHT SKY. I MEAN, IT WAS JUST, SHE WAS A SENSATION. A STAR. UNINTENTIONAL SENSATION, EVERYONE WAS THINKING ABOUT, HER TALKING ABOUT, HER SNL, SHE WAS EVERYWHERE. AND EVERYONE HAD THEIR EYES ON HER.  RIGHT, SHE SET THE STAGE FOR DONALD TRUMP, OR AT LEAST IN MANY WAYS WAS THE MODELED FOR DONALD TRUMP. AND THE FACT THAT SHE HAS BEEN SORT OF LOSING HER SHINE FOR YEARS NOW IS ONE REASON WHY I'M A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP'S HOLD ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS ETERNAL. RIGHT? I MEAN, I CERTAINLY THINK THAT WE SHOULDN'T ASSUME THAT HE IS JUST GOING TO GO AWAY, BUT THIS STICK DOES GET OLD. YOU KNOW, PEOPLE DO LOSE THEIR NOVELTY AND THEIR LAWYER. AND THINGS ARE JUST ALWAYS CHANGING. AND THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK IS INTERESTING ABOUT SARAH PALIN, SHE COULD'VE HAD SUCH A DIFFERENT CAREER. AS YOU SAID, WHEN SHE WAS CHOSEN, THERE WAS, YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS WERE TERRIFIED. SHE SEEMED ELECTRIC. THE MEDIA WAS KIND OF IN LOVE WITH HER UNTIL THOSE VERY EMBARRASSING INTERVIEWS. AND HAD SHE SORT OF PURSUED THE PATH THAT SHE HAD PURSUED SOMEWHAT AS GOVERNOR, I MEAN, SHE WAS VERY RIGHT-WING WHICH WASN'T AS MUCH OF A, KIND, OF FULL-TIME PROVOCATEUR WHEN SHE WAS GOVERNOR OF ALASKA. SHE COULD HAVE HAD A HUGE CAREER ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. RIGHT? I, MEAN THE FACT THAT SHE WENT ON WAS A CHOICE.  YEAH, SHE COULD HAVE PROBABLY HAD A GOOD SHOT OF BEING THE NOMINEE. BUT SHE STOPPED BEING THE GOVERNOR, SHE DECIDED TO BE A KIND OF, LIKE, FULL-TIME SORT OF RIGHT-WING CELEBRITY. I THINK A LITTLE EARLIER BEN THAT WAS A PLAUSIBLE PATH TO PRESIDENCY. WHICH, AGAIN, THE PROOF OF CONCEPT THAT DONALD TRUMP ENDS UP PROVING. BUT SHE WAS VERY MUCH, YOU KNOW, THIS KIND OF TROUBLE POLITICS, I WILL NEVER FORGET BEING IN THAT ROOM OF THE RNC INTO THOUSAND EIGHT IN TWIN CITIES WHEN SHE WAS GIVING HER SPEECH. AT ONE POINT SHE TURNED TO TALK ABOUT THE, I DON'T KNOW, SHE DIDN'T CALL IT THE, FAKE NEWS, BUT THE MEDIA. EVERYONE, THE PLACE WENT NUTS. EVERYONE STARTED POINTING AND CURSING AND GIVING THE MIDDLE FINGER AND PRAYING UP AT THE CAMERA BOOTHS. AND IT WAS VERY MUCH TRUMP BEFORE TRUMP. I REMEMBER BEING IN THAT MOMENT, LIKE, OH, SOMETHING REAL DARK AND UNSETTLING IS BEING UNLEASHED IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW.  RIGHT, AND THEN WE HAVE SEEN THE CONSEQUENCES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS OF, YOU KNOW, THAT BEING UNLEASHED AND KIND OF GROWING AND GROWING AND GROWING UNTIL IT NEARLY BROUGHT THE COUNTRY TO ITS KNEES. BUT I DO THINK IT IS INTERESTING THAT THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW HER THE MOST, RIGHT, THE PEOPLE WHO WATCHED HER UP CLOSE, A VERY, YOU KNOW, 50 5:45 IS NOT A NORMAL MARGIN IN A SWING 'S CONGRESSIONAL RACE. LIKE, YOU DON'T SEE PEOPLE IN SWING DISTRICTS WINNING BY 12%.  BY THE, WAY IT WAS LAME STREAM MEDIA, THANK YOU FOR THE LADY IN MY AIRLESS -- PALIN COVERED SHE HAS DONE IN HIS LIFE. THE LAME STREAM MEDIA. BUT AGAIN, THAT IS A GREAT POINT. I REMEMBER WHEN SHE SAID, WHEN DON YOUNG DIED, IN OFFICE, AND THERE WAS GONNA BE A SPECIAL ELECTION. THERE WAS A WHOLE BUNCH OF CANDIDATES. SHE DECLARED, LIKE, I WAS, OH, WE ARE GONNA JUST HAVE ZERO PALIN AS A POLITICAL FIGURE. IN MY HEAD I WAS LIKE, SHE WILL PROBABLY WIN. SHE WON STATEWIDE, WE ARE GONNA HAVE SARAH PALIN. SO REPUBLICAN. WE ARE GONNA HAVE SARAH PALIN, MAYBE WE WILL NOW HAVE, LIKE, IS THIS THE SARAH PALIN TWO POINT OH. SHE'S GONNA RUN FOR CONGRESS, WHO KNOWS WHAT ELSE. IN TWO CONSECUTIVE ELECTIONS, FOURTH ALASKANS TO BE, LIKE NO, WE DON'T WANT TO STICK. WE WANT THE WOMAN WHO IS REALLY FOCUSED ON OUR FISHERIES. AND OUR HEALTHY FISH POPULATION AND SOMEONE WHO IS, LIKE, THE OPPOSITE OF SARAH PALIN IT SEEMS. VERY LIKED AND RESPECTED ON ALL SIDES. NOT A POLARIZING CHARACTER. IT'S REALLY A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING POLITICS.  I ALSO THINK THAT, LIKE, RANKED CHOICE VOTING AS KIND OF THE POLARIZING.  YEP. THAT IS THE IDEA BEHIND.  IT IT IS THE POLARIZING, BOTH BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT SORT OF THE MOST PIVOTAL THING ISN'T WHO WINS THE PRIMARY, YOU DON'T KIND OF OUTSOURCE THESE DECISIONS ENTIRELY TO THE RABID BASE IN PRIMARY ELECTIONS. BUT IT ALSO IS THE POLARIZING BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU AN INCENTIVE TO TRY TO WIN OVER THE ENTIRE ELECTORATE AS OPPOSED TO JUST TURNING OUT YOUR BASE. BECAUSE EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NOT VOTE FOR YOU IN THE FIRST ROUND --  COULD GET YOU IN A SECOND.  RIGHT.  RIGHT, SO EXACTLY, THE IDEA OF -- RIGHT, THE POLITICAL LOGIC WHICH PROPELLED DONALD TRUMP IN THAT PRIMARY IN 2016, WHICH WAS THAT I HAVE GOT THIS INCREDIBLE HOLD ON 30% OF THE POPULATION. EVERYONE CAME AROUND. BUT I CAN HOLD THIS PLURALITY. IT'S THE SAME THING HE HAS RIGHT NOW, LARGER THAN 30%. IT IS THE OPPOSITE MOUTH OF, LIKE, CAN I BE BROADLY APPEALING TO A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE. WHICH USED TO BE ONE OF THE KEY RECIPES OF POLITICS THAT HAS BEEN KIND OF LOST. BUT I THINK IT RESURRECTED A LITTLE BIT IN THESE MIDTERMS.  RIGHT, PART OF RICKSHAW'S VOTING IS PART OF THE STORY HERE. PART OF THE BROADER STORY, I THINK, IS A REJECTION OF SARAH PALIN STYLES OF POLITICS. TRUMPIST POLITICS, OBVIOUSLY. THE LOSS OF ALL OF THESE STOP AND STEAL CANDIDATES. AND I THINK, I DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN UNDERESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF ABORTION AND THE DOBBS DECISION IN THIS RACE. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT SHE RAN, MARY PORTOLA, RAN AS THE PRO-CHOICE PRO FISHERIES CANDIDATE.  RIGHT, SHE WAS PRO-CHOICE AND SHE WAS PRO FISHERIES. SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST FASCINATING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, I THINK, IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND SHE NOW HAS BEEN REELECTED IN A SHORT SPAN. SHE WILL BE REPRESENTING THE STATE OF ALASKA IN THERE AT LARGE SEAT HELD FOR DECADES BY DON YOUNG. MICHELLE GOLDBERG, GREAT TO HAVE YOU, THANKS AGAIN.  THANK YOU.

        "trs": "TRUMP ENDORSED SENATE NOMINEE IN GEORGIA, HERSCHEL WALKER, HAS BEEN ON IN THE WEST POLITICAL CANDIDATES WE HAVE EVER SEEN RUN FOR SENATE. JUST YESTERDAY, THE SECOND WOMAN TO SAY THAT WALKER ALLEGEDLY PRESSURED HER INTO HAVING AN ABORTION IN A PRESS CONFERENCE. SHE SHARED ON CAMERA THAT YOU DID NOT DISCLOSE THE NAME. AT THE PRESS, OR SHE CAME FORWARD WITH WHAT SHE CLAIMS TO BE NEW EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THEIR RELATIONSHIP, YOU SEE THAT PICTURE. THERE SHE TELLS YOU -- THAT WALKER SAYS THIS WOMAN IS LYING, NBC NEWS HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO VERIFY THEIR CLAIMS. WALKER HAS SAID THAT HE SUPPORTS A NATIONAL BAN ON ABORTION, HE HAS CALLED ABORTION MURDER AND DOES NOT SUPPORT EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE OR INCEST. THIS IS PRECISELY THE KIND OF VETTING PROBLEM THAT EVERYONE IN REPUBLICAN CIRCLES WAS WARNING ABOUT BACK WHEN DONALD TRUMP AND PICK THE FORMER FOOTBALL STAR AND CELEBRITY APPRENTICE CONTESTANT TO BE HIS CHOSEN SENATE CANDIDATE IN GEORGIA. BUT IT IS NOT THE ONLY BIG PROBLEM WITH WALKER'S CANDIDACY, THERE ARE MANY. BUT ANOTHER ONE IS THAT HE DOESN'T REALLY LIVE FULL-TIME IN GEORGIA. LIKE, FAILED PENNSYLVANIA REPUBLICAN SENATOR CANDIDATE MITT, ALICE WALKER IS A -- WALK OR A STRONG RIDGE INSTEAD OF GEORGIA. IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL, UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA, WON THE HEISMAN TROPHY. BUT TODAY, A NEW REPORT SHOWS THAT WALKER IS GETTING A TAX BREAK ON HIS HOUSE IN DALLAS, TEXAS. ONE THAT IS INTENDED ONLY FOR PRIMARY RESIDENCE. WALKER'S CAMPAIGN DID NOT RESPOND TO A REQUEST FOR COMMENT FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES. WE HAVE ALSO REACHED OUT AND NOT HEARD BACK. THE NEW INFORMATION CALLED INTO QUESTION WALKER STANDING AS A REAL RESIDENT, RUNNING FOR SENATE IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. -- LIVES IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA. HE'S A COLUMNIST FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES. HERSCHEL WALKER'S CAMPAIGN AND HE JOINS ME NOW. YOU KNOW, CHARLES, I REMEMBER WHEN WALKER WAS BEING FLOATED VERY EARLY ON, BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM AND HAD HIM ON HIS SHOW. AND SORT OF, LIKE, YOU KNOW, FIXED IDEA WAY WAS LIKE, WALKER, WALKER SHOULD RUN IN GEORGIA. AND AT THE TIME I REMEMBER READING A BUNCH OF ARTICLES BEING, LIKE, WELL HE DOESN'T LIVE IN GEORGIA? THAT IS INSIDE DALLAS. LIKE HE PROBABLY SHOULD LIVE IN GEORGIA. AND THAT ISSUE IS STILL THERE, EVEN THOUGH IT DOES SEEM LIKE IT WENT AWAY. IT IS NOT LIKE WARNOCK TRY TO DO TO WALK OR WHAT FETTERMAN DID TO US.  YEAH, YOU KNOW, WARNOCK IS JUST NOT THAT KIND OF AN ATTACK DOG. HE IS NOT YOUR TRADITIONAL POLITICIAN. HE IS A PASTOR OF A CHURCH. YOU GET THAT SENSIBILITY FROM HIM. PEOPLE HERE IN GEORGIA ALWAYS KNEW THAT THEY WERE KIND OF BRINGING HERSCHEL WALKER BACK INTO GEORGIA TO RUN. HE WAS A CARPETBAGGER FROM THE BEGINNING. THAT IS THE LEAST OF THE PROBLEMS, HOWEVER, WITH THE RUNNING OF HERSCHEL WALKER. HE IS COMPLETELY, COMPLETELY ILL EQUIPPED TO BE A SENATOR OR ELECTED OFFICIAL OF ANY SORT ON ANY LEVEL. AND EVERYONE HERE KNOWS THAT, EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO VOTE FOR HIM KNOW THAT. BUT THEY ARE LOCKED IN. NOW, THEY HAVE NO OTHER CANDIDATE. WHEN THEY HAD A CHANCE TO REALLY CHALLENGE HERSCHEL WALKER, -- PRIMARIES. NO ONE DID, BECAUSE HE WAS DONALD TRUMP'S PICK. ALL OF THIS WOULD HAVE COME, OUT THEY PROBABLY WOULD'VE HAD A STRONGER CANDIDATE, THERE WAS A LOT OF RESENTMENT OR FEAR OF STACEY ABRAMS, WHICH DROVE A LOT OF VOTE TO CAMP. I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE REMEMBER THIS, BUT WHEN MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE ONCE SAID, I THINK IT WAS A PODCAST WHERE HER VOTERS WERE TELLING HER, THEY WERE MOVED OUT OF THE STATE RATHER THAN BEING GOVERNED BY STACEY ABRAMS. THE IDEA OF A BLACK PERSON, A BLACK WOMAN, STACEY ABRAMS GOVERNING THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA? IT FREAKS PEOPLE OUT. SO KEMP HAD THAT ADVANTAGE. WALKER IS THE CANDIDATE WHO IS IN THE REPUBLICAN SEAT ON THE SENATE SIDE COULD ALSO ADD IT, BUT HE IS TERRIBLE. SO HE DIDN'T HAVE IT. SO THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM. THIS IDEA OF HIM BEING A CARPETBAGGER AND GETTING A TAX BREAK IN TEXAS ONLY ADDS A MARGINALLY TO THAT. BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH OTHER STUFF. IT ALL DISQUALIFIES HIM FROM BEING --  YEAH, THE SENATOR -- THERE IS WHERE I DO THINK THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF A SIMILARITY WITH MEHMET OZ. IT'S LIKE, WHAT MEHMET OZ IS RUNNING FOR SENATE IN PENNSYLVANIA I WAS LIKE, WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT? WHAT IS THE LOGIC? MEHMET OZ, PENNSYLVANIA SENATOR. RIGHT? LIKE, PAT TOOMEY, HE WAS A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN BEFORE. YOU KNOW, KATIE BRITT, JUST GOT ELECTED IN ALABAMA. IT WORKED IN ALABAMA POLITICS, I BELIEVE SHE WAS A PREACHER AND SHELBY STAFFER IN ALABAMA. RIGHT? SO, YOU KNOW, IF YOU OR HAVE A CERTAIN LOGIC THERE. IT'S LIKE, WHY IS THIS PERSON GONNA BE THE SENATOR FOR THIS PLACE. THERE IS LITERALLY NO REASON OTHER THAN NAME RECOGNITION AND DONALD TRUMP LIKES. AND THAT IS IT, THE SUM TOTAL OF THE ARGUMENT FOR WHY THIS INDIVIDUAL SHOULD REPRESENT THIS STATE IN THE U.S. SENATE.  I MEAN, I THINK THEY CAN MAKE A SLIGHTLY STRONGER CASE IF IN FACT HE HAD ANY OTHER REASONS TO BE A SENATOR, WHICH HE DOES NOT. I THINK THEY COULD PROBABLY MAKE A SLIGHTLY STRONGER CASE BECAUSE HE'S A PERSON GEORGIA, RIGHT. HE WAS BORN HERE, RACED HERE. HE GOES TO COLLEGE, HE GOES TO HIGH PERFORMANCE COLLEGE HERE. SO IT'S NOT LIKE HE IS COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA, HE IS JUST DISCONNECTED FROM REALITY. LIKE, HE IS DISCONNECTED FROM INTELLECT. HE IS DISCONNECTED FROM QUALIFICATIONS. THAT IS THE BIGGER PROBLEM.  THERE IS ALSO, I MEAN, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE ABORTION DESTRUCTION HERE, WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN THE FIRST REPORTING IN WHICH A WOMAN SAID THAT -- ACTUALLY HAD A SON WITH HERSCHEL WALKER. SAID THAT IN ONE CASE HE PRESSURED HER FOR AN ABORTION, ACTUALLY PRESSURED HIM FOR A SECOND, REJECTION, GUETTA SHE -- THERE WAS A RECEIPT FROM THE ABORTION CLINIC WHERE SHE RECEIVED THE ABORTION. YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THIS IS SORT OF, THE WAY THAT IT HAS KIND OF BEEN CHARACTERIZED IS, LIKE, THESE DARK STORIES FROM HIS PAST. BUT FOR ME THE KEY THING IS, HE WOULD VOTE FOR A NATIONAL ABORTION BAN. LIKE, THAT IS THE POSITION THAT HE IS RUNNING ON. THAT IS THE PARTY THAT HE WANTS TO BE A PART OF. AND THIS DEMONSTRATES THE FUNDAMENTAL HYPOCRISY OR AN SERIOUSNESS ABOUT THAT. I WONDER WHAT ROLE YOU THINK, EVEN ON THIS DAY WE HAVE NEWS THAT GEORGIA SUPREME COURT IS NOW REINSTATED THE STATES BAN OF ABORTION AFTER SIX WEEKS. WHAT ROLE YOU THINK ABORTION HAS PLAYED IN THIS RACE? WHAT ROLE YOU THINK IT WILL PLAY IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF THE RUNOFF?  I THINK IT HAS PLAYED A ROLE IN THIS RACE IN THE SAME WAY THAT IT HAS PLAYED ANOTHER RACES. BECAUSE IT IS NOT A SEPARATE LINE ON THE BALLOT. IT PLAYS A LITTLE BIT LESS OF A ROLE. YOU HAVE TO VOTE BY PROXY. THAT THIS PERSON IS WITH THE PARTY THAT OPPOSES THE THING THAT I AM IN FAVOR OF. I THINK THE BIGGER QUESTION. THE THING THAT WE DON'T TALK ENOUGH ABOUT IS THAT THAT CHILD IS A LIE. RIGHT? THIS IS THE PARTY THAT TALKS INCESSANTLY ABOUT ABSENT BLACK FATHERS. AND HERSCHEL WALKER IS BY ALL MEASURES AN ABSENT BLACK FATHER. TO THAT CHILD. THE REPUBLICANS IN THIS STATE HAVE MADE TWISTED THEMSELVES INTO KNOTS, INTO KNOTS! TRYING TO PUT HERSCHEL WALKER INTO THE -- DEFILER BLACK PEOPLE IN. RIGHT? IF ANYBODY, IF ANY OTHER BLACK PERSON ON THE LIBERAL SIDE WAS SHOWING UP AND NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE A SENTENCE, THEY WOULD ATTACK HIM AND LIMBAUGH ASKED THAT PERSON. BUT NOW RUSSIA WALKER IS SAYING WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR. AND ANOTHER BLACK PERSON WHO WAS AN ABSENTEE FATHER WHO WAS ADVOCATING FOR ABORTIONS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO HE IMPREGNATED WOULD BE LAMBASTED BY THESE PEOPLE. BUT BECAUSE HE IS SAYING THEY WANT TO -- THEY EXCUSE IT. HE IS ANY OTHER BLACK PERSON WHO BEHAVED IN THE WAY THAT HERSCHEL WALKER BEHAVES, BUT HAPPENED TO BE LIBERAL AND SUPPORTED POLICIES THAT HELPED BLOCK PEOPLE, HE WOULD BE LAMBASTED BY THE GEORGIA REPUBLICAN WHO ARE NOW SUPPORTING AND EXCUSING AND MAKING EXCUSES FOR HERSCHEL WALKER.  YEAH, I MEAN, THE WAY THAT I HAVE RUN THE THOUGHT EXPERIMENT I HAD IS TO JUST TAKE 30 SECONDS TO CONSIDER. WHO WILL BE THE ELECTORAL RESULTS IN THE DIVIDED STATE OF GEORGIA IF THE BLACK DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR STATEWIDE OFFICE HAD HERSCHEL WALKER'S PACKAGE? I MEAN, IT IS JUST LIKE, OBVIOUSLY IT IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN. YOU NOW HAVE THE FULL TEAM TRYING TO PULL THE FINISH LINE, INCLUDING GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP WHO I THINK HELPED HIM PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME AROUND BECAUSE HE IS RELATIVELY POPULAR. WAS ON THE BALLOT. HE IS NOT THIS TIME. HE WILL BE CAMPAIGNING FOR HIM. I WONDER IF YOU THINK, HOW MUCH THAT MATTERS. A, IT IS A RUNOFF. WITHOUT ANY OTHER OFFICES. OR B, THAT KEMP IS CAMPAIGNING?  LISTEN, CAMP HAS TO DO THIS TO STAY IN THE GOOD GRACES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP ALREADY HATES HIM. SO THE ONLY OTHER PART OF THE PARTY THAT HE CAN APPEAL TO IS THE SENATE REPUBLICANS, MITCH MCCONNELL AND THE LIKE WHO NEED HELP. THEY WANT TO HAVE THE EXTRA'S. EVEN THOUGH THAT MEANS, DOESN'T MEAN THEY WILL GET CONTROL OF THE SENATE. IT DOES STRENGTHEN THEIR HAND IN THE SENATE. KEMP IS TRYING TO STAY IN THE RACES. KEMP WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH HERSCHEL WALKER. AND HE PROVED THAT DURING HIS CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR. AND NO ONE WANTS TO TOUCH HERSCHEL WALKER, BUT THEY HAVE TO STAY IN THE GOOD GRACES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. SO THEY DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE. THEY DO WHAT THE PARTY IS ASKING THEM TO DO.

        "trs": "> GEORGIA GOP SENATE CANDIDATE HERSCHEL WALKER GOING VIRAL FOR ALL OF THE WRONG REASONS. AND AT THE WORST POSSIBLE TIME. TODAY, THE STATE SUPREME COURT BLOCKING A REPUBLICAN EFFORT TO ELIMINATE EARLY VOTE THING SATURDAY. SO VOTERS ARE HITTING THE POLLS, CHOOSING BETWEEN WALKER AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK. AS ANOTHER WALKER VERBAL SLIP-UP MAKES HEADLINES. IT HAPPENED ON FOX NEWS, NO LESS. TED CRUZ AND LINDSEY GRAHAM APPEARING WITH WALKER, TRYING TO PROP HIM UP. TRUST ME, IT DIDN'T HELP.  FIRST OF ALL, THIS ELECTION IS MORE THAN HERSCHEL WALKER, BUT IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A VAMPIRE, I WANTED TO BE A WEREWOLF. I'M THINKING THEY BETTER GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE. SOMEBODY IS FLOATING ON YOUR CEILING, GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE.  I'M SORRY, I'M A LITTLE BIT STUCK OF, WHEN I WAS JUST LISTENING TO FROM HERSCHEL WALKER, TALK OF VAMPIRES AND WEREWOLVES. HARD TO IMAGINE WHO HE IS TRYING TO APPEAL TO. WARNOCK HAS A SLIGHT EDGE OVER WALKER, 51% VERSUS 47%. THAT'S WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR. DEMOCRATS CLINCHING THE SENATE, BUT A WARNOCK VICTORY WOULD STOP JOE MANCHIN AND KYRSTEN SINEMA TO HOLD THINGS UP. AND TODAY, THE GEORGIA SUPREME COURT REINSTATED THE STATE'S ABORTION LAWS. WALKER, WHO CLAIMS TO BE ANTI-ABORTION, FACING ALLEGATIONS FROM MULTIPLE WOMEN THAT HE PAID FOR THEIR ABORTIONS. HE HAD DENIED THOSE ALLEGATIONS. JOINING ME NOW IS A POLITICAL REPORTER, GREG, ALWAYS AN HONOR TO HAVE YOU WITH US. ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, HERSCHEL WALKER'S GAFFES GET PLENTY OF ATTENTION, BUT HOW ARE THEY PLAYING WITH THE VOTERS IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA?  GREAT QUESTION, BECAUSE THEY'RE PLAYING INTO -- WELL, SENATOR WARNOCK'S ARGUMENT THAT HERSCHEL WALKER IS UNFIT FOR OFFICE. HE'S BEEN USING THESE GAFFES, THESE SLIP-UPS, THESE LIES FROM HERSCHEL WALKER TO BUILD THAT CASE THAT THE REPUBLICAN JUST ISN'T FIT FOR OFFICE, THAT HE SHOULDN'T BE A U.S. SENATOR. THAT THE JOB IS TOUGH AND DEMANDS SOMEONE SERIOUS IN THAT OFFICE. AND IN WARNOCK'S CASE, IT'S HIM.  SO POLLS GIVING WARNOCK A SLIGHT EM, AHEAD WITH INDEPENDENTS. DOES HE HAVE ENOUGH MOMENTUM AT THIS POINT?  HE HAS THE SLIGHT EDGE, BUT IT'S HARD TO POLL THE ELECTORATE THAT WILL SHOW UP ON DECEMBER 6th. IT'S JUST SO UNCERTAIN RIGHT NOW. IT'S AFTER THANKSGIVING, THERE'S ALWAYS A LOWER TURNOUT IN RUNOFFS IN GEORGIA. SENATE CONTROL ISN'T AT STAKE. BUT DEMOCRATS ARE VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE FACT IS THAT THIS HELPS THEM. SENATE WARNOCK ALWAYS WANTED TO MAKE THIS A ONE ON ONE BATTLE. WHEREAS HERSCHEL WALKER WANTS TO MAKE THIS RACE A REFERENDUM ON DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE SENATE. NOW THAT'S OFF THE TABLE, THAT COULD HELP WARNOCK MAKE HIS CASE BETTER.  LET'S TALK ABOUT PEOPLE AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO SHOW UP FOR A RUNOFF ELECTION. THE GEORGIA SUPREME COURT REINSTATING THAT ABORTION BAN AT SIX WEEKS. IT WAS SUCH A HUGE ISSUE. DO YOU THINK VOTERS WILL SAY I'VE GOT TO GO BACK, I HAVE TO GO BACK FOR THIS RUNOFF, BECAUSE NOW THE FUTURE OF ABORTION RIGHTS IN GEORGIA IS ONCE AGAIN AT STAKE?  YEAH, DEMOCRATS THINK IT'S FOOD NEWS, BECAUSE IT RESHIFTS ATTENTION BACK TO ABORTION, THIS ISSUE THAT IS SO GALVANIZING. IT WASN'T THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN THE POLLS, IT WAS TWO OR THREE, BUT THAT DIDN'T MEAN IT WASN'T CONSEQUENTIAL TO SO MANY VOTERS. THIS, AGAIN, WILL PLAY INTO SENATOR WARNOCK'S ARGUMENT. HE WANTS TO REPEAL ABORTION RESTRICTIONS IN GEORGIA AND ELSEWHERE.  WE KNOW THAT FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA COMING TO HELP HERSCHEL -- EXCUSE ME, RAPHAEL WARNOCK DECEMBER 1 IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. HE'S HEADING BACK TO CAMPAIGN FOR THEM. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT BARACK OBAMA SAID BEFORE THE MIDTERMS.  THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE DEMOCRACY IS IF WE, TOGETHER, NURTURE IT AND FIGHT FOR IT. AND THAT STARTS WITH ELECTING PEOPLE WHO KNOW YOU AND SEE YOU AND CARE ABOUT YOU. PEOPLE WHO WILL STRUGGLE ALONGSIDE YOU. YOU DID IT TWICE WHEN YOU VOTED TWICE TO SEND REVEREND WARNOCK TO THE U.S. SENATE. SO NOW YOU NEED TO DO IT AGAIN.  WHAT DOES IT SAY, GREG, THAT THE DEMOCRATS ARE DEPLOYING BARACK OBAMA ONCE AGAIN INTO THE STATE OF GEORGIA?  IT SHOWS YOU HOW IMPORTANT THIS BATTLE IS, THIS ELECTION BATTLE IS, HOW CONSEQUENTIAL IT IS. SENATOR WARNOCK RIGHT NOW IS TRYING TO REV UP THE BASE WITH BARACK OBAMA. BUT HE'S ALSO TRYING TO WIN BACK THE SPLIT TICKET VOTERS WHO SIDED WITH GOVERNOR KEMP AND HIM IN THE MIDTERMS. SO HE'S DOING THIS UNIQUE TWO STEP THAT HE THINKS HE CAN PULL IT OFF.  GREG, THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO JOIN US THIS EVENING. > AND AHEAD, THERE ARE CALLS FOR JUSTICE AFTER A HORRIFIC JAIL CELL BEATING IN GEORGIA. IT WAS CAUGHT ON TAPE. THREE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED. I HAVE THIS SPECIAL INTERVIEW. BUT FIRST, A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO FOR KEVIN McCARTHY. ANOTHER REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER BREAKING FROM HIM. THIS IS SNOWBALLING. THAT'S NEXT.

        "trs": " TODAY, THE SECOND WOMAN ALLEGING SHE HAD AN ABORTION AT THE URGING OF TRUMP ENDORSED SENATOR CANDIDATE HERSCHEL WALKER CAME FORWARD WITH WHAT SHE CLAIMS TO BE NEW EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THEIR RELATIONSHIP. SHE APPEARED ON CAMERA ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT DISCLOSE YOUR NAME. SHE SAID SHE WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH WALKER FOR SIX YEARS AND DECIDED TO COME FORWARD AFTER SHE HEARD HIS DENIALS.  HERSCHEL, I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD DENY KNOWING ME OR OUR RELATIONSHIP. ARE YOU REALLY WILLING TO DO ANYTHING INCLUDING LYING TO THE VOTERS IN GEORGIA TO BECOME A SENATOR?  I SHOULD NOTE, THIS WOMAN UNLIKE THE FIRST WOMAN THAT ACCUSED WALKER OF THIS, DIDN'T PRESENT EVIDENCE SPECIFICALLY SHOWING THAT WALKER PUSHED OR PAID FOR AN ABORTION AS HIS PREVIOUS ACCUSERS DID. HOWEVER, SHE DID PRESENT PREVIOUSLY VIEWED NOT VIEWED PHOTOS OF WALKER AND HERSELF, AS PROOF OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP. WALKER SAYS BOTH WOMEN ARE LYING. NBC NEWS HAS NOT INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED HER CLAIMS. ALL THIS COMES JUST TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE GEORGIA RUNOFF BETWEEN WALKER AND INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK. THE THING IS, THAT RACE IS NO LONGER ABOUT WHICH PARTY WILL CONTROL THE U.S. SENATE, BUT WHAT DEMOCRATS CAN DO WITH THE 51 VOTE MAJORITY. AS WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST GREG SERGEANT WRITES TODAY, HAVING 51 SENATORS AS OPPOSED TO 50 WOULD GIVE DEMOCRATS SOLE CONTROL OVER INVESTIGATIONS SUCH AS TRUMP'S CORRUPTION WAS THEY CAN DO TO COUNTER THE CROWN SHOW HEARINGS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AND CONGRESS. IF WE'RE INVESTIGATING LEGITIMATE ISSUES WHILE THEY'RE FIXATED ON HUNTER BIDEN'S LAP TOP, WE'LL BE DOING OUR JOB, AND WILL BE WINNING THE BATTLE PUBLIC OPINION. JOINING US NOW IS A FORMER SENIOR ADVISER OF THE LATE SENATOR HARRY REID OF NEVADA. HE'S CURRENTLY SENATOR ADVISER FOR SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS FROM VERMONT. FAZI, YOU'VE WORKED IN THE SENATE FOR MANY YEARS IN DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS IN TERMS OF THE MAJORITY AND MINORITY. FOR FOLKS WHO DON'T KNOW THE INSTITUTION, HOW BIG A DIFFERENCE WOULD IT BE TO GO FROM THE 50 VOTE MAJORITY OF THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE TIE BREAKING VOTE OF KAMALA HARRIS TO A 51 VOTE MAJORITY.  IT MATTERS A BIG DEAL, CHRIS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COMPOSITION OF THESE COMMITTEES, WHETHER TALKING THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE, ON A SECURITY COMMITTEE, HEALTH LABOR PENSIONS COMMITTEE. WHEN YOU ARE 50/50, THE VOTES AND BUDGETS ARE SPLIT. NOW IMAGINE IF YOU HAD 51 SENATORS IN THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS. THE VOTES ON THE COMMITTEE CHANGE. THEY BECOME A MAJORITY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY BECOME A MAJORITY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE COMMITTEES, THEY GET TO SET THE RULES OF THESE COMMITTEES? NOW WHEN YOU THINK OF ONE OF THE RULES OF THE COMMITTEES, DOES A COMMITTEE HAVE SUBPOENA POWER FOR INSTANCE? COULD IT CALL THE HEAD OF A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY AND TESTIFY ABOUT THE ARRANGES COST OF INSULIN FOR INSTANCE? YES YOU COULD DO THAT UNDER A DEMOCRATIC SENATE WITH 51 VOTES BECAUSE THE COMPOSITION OF VOTES WOULD ALLOWED THE RULES TO BE GOVERNED FOR DEMOCRATS.  LAST TIME AROUND, THERE WAS THIS REALLY WEIRD INTERIM PERIOD, I THINK WAS JANUARY 5TH THAT THE GEORGIA RUN OFF HAPPENED, AND THEY BOTH HEADWINDS FOR DEMOCRATS. SO THERE WAS GONNA BE A 50 SEAT SLIMMEST MAJORITY FOR DEMOCRATS. THERE WAS THIS DEAL THAT HAD TO BE WORKED OUT WITH MCCONNELL BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD POWER, THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT OUTRIGHT MAJORITY, AND IT MEANT THAT THERE WERE SOME LIMITATIONS TO WHAT THE NORMAL WORKINGS OF A MAJORITY WOULD LOOK LIKE?  YES THAT'S RIGHT. IN MANY WAYS THE COMMITTEES WERE HAMPERED BY THIS BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T BE A VERY ACTIVE COMMITTEE, BUT NEVERTHELESS DEMOCRATS PERSEVERED THROUGH IT AND AS WE ALL KNOW, THEY HAD A GOOD LEGISLATIVE SESSION, WHICH SEES A BUNCH OF RECONCILIATION TO THEIR ADVANTAGE, SOMETHING THEY COULD PASS WITH 50 VOTES. IT BECOMES A LITTLE STRONGER WITH 51 VOTES, BUT YOU'RE STILL HAMPERED BY THE FACT THAT IN THE HOUSE THERE WOULD BE A HOUSE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY. THE OTHER THING WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT CHRIS'S NOMINATIONS. A LOT OF THESE NOMINEES WOULD BE PUT UP FOR VOTES. WHEN YOU HAVE 51 VOTES, TO FILL AN FCC AND HAVE A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY THERE. TO HAVE JUDICIAL NOMINEES PASS, IT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CUSHION. SOMETIMES EVEN FOR ATTENDANCE REASONS, CHRIS. IF SOMEONE HAPPENS TO BE SICK RIGHT? THEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AT LEAST 50 VOTES.  AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN THE SENATE AND I KNOW YOU'RE CLOSE TO SENATOR SANDERS AND WORKED FOR SENATOR REID, HOW DO YOU VIEW THIS PERIOD? WHETHER IT'S 50 OR 51 AND 51 WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE OF THIS DEMOCRATIC-CONTROLLED SENATE FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS, WHICH HONESTLY, I'M NOT SURE A TON OF PEOPLE WERE BANKING ON, THEY WERE HOPING FOR NOT BANKING.  WE SHOULD ALL FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE FACT THAT A BIDEN COALITION SHOWED UP VOTER NOT ONLY 2020 BUT ALL, ALSO IN 2022. THERE'S LOTS TO BE PLEASED ABOUT THE STATE OF THE SITUATION. I THINK WHEN YOU HEAD INTO THE NEXT TWO YEARS AS PLEASED AS I AM, WE GOTTA THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE POPULAR VOTE WENT AGAINST US IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO STILL RECKON WITH IF THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. HOW DO WE IMPROVE? I THINK THE PATH FOR DEMOCRATIC MAJORITIES TO BUILD ON THAT AND IN THE HOUSE AND MAINTAIN THE PRESIDENCY THROUGH WORKING CLASS VOTERS. ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT IS, THINK THE CONTRAST IS CLEAR NOW, BECAUSE IF YOU THINK BACK IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, JOE BIDEN HAD TO LARGELY CHALLENGE HIS OWN PARTY AT EVERY TURN TO TRY TO GET THE VOTES NEEDED TO PASS AN AGENDA. NOW YOU'VE GOT A FOIL AND A CONTRAST OUT OF KEVIN MCCARTHY THAT'S GONNA BE A BIT OF A CLOWN SHOW ON THE HOUSE SIDE. IF YOU HAVE YOUR ACT TOGETHER AND YOU'RE RUNNING WHAT YOU THINK IS THE APPROPRIATE AGENDA THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC CARES ABOUT. YOU'RE INVESTIGATING THINGS LIKE, CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY, TICKETMASTER, LET'S GO EXPOSE THEIR GREED AND THEIR CORRUPTION AS A MONOPOLY, LET'S GO TO GAS PRICES IN STOCK DIVIDENDS THAT OCCUR FROM OIL COMPANIES. THESE ARE ALL OPPORTUNITIES TO SHOWCASE: HERE'S AN AGENDA THAT ACTUALLY SPEAKS TO YOUR PAIN AND SUFFERING AND HERE'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO, AND OVER THERE IS A JOKE ON THE OTHER SIDE.  THAT'S A GOOD POINT. IT ALSO MAKES ME REALIZE HOW LITTLE, HOW STRONG THOSE COMMITTEES WERE DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS, WHICH HAD REALLY SERVED. EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF LEGISLATING BEING DONE AND A LOT OF NOMINEES, PARTICULARLY JUDICIAL NOMINEES GETTING CONFIRMED, HOW MUCH DO YOU-- WHERE DO YOU THINK THE NEXT TWO WEEKS, WHO THIS CAMPAIGN SITUATION FAVORS IN GEORGIA BETWEEN WARNOCK AND WALKER?  WE ARE IN A VERY STRONG POSITION. IT'S ALL REALLY A MATTER OF TURNOUT. IT SEEMS LIKE THE POLLS EACH DAY CONTINUE TO SHOW STRENGTH ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. THE TURNOUT OPERATION HAS THUS FAR BEEN GOOD AND TESTED A COUPLE OF TIMES IN GEORGIA AS YOU KNOW IN 2020. CHRIS, WHEN YOU THINK BACK TO 2020, WHEN JOHN OSSOFF, AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK WON IN GEORGIA, REMEMBER WE HAD A STIMULUS CHECK DEBATE DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME. I THINK IT'S CONTINUALLY IMPORTANT FOR DEMOCRATS TO CONTINUALLY OFFER WORKING CLASS SOLUTIONS AND IDEAS THAT THEY WANT TO PUT FORWARD THAT A PROACTIVE. DON'T JUST LOOK ON THE FACT THEY HAVE A LOONY BIN TO KIND OF DEBATE ON THE OTHER SIDE. YES THAT'S WORKING TO OUR VANTAGE, BUT LET'S CONTINUE TO PRESS THE CASE AND HERE'S A WORKING CLASS AGENDA LIKE THE STIMULUS CHECKS OF 2020, THAT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO PROMISE AND DELIVER ON FOR YOU.  ONE MORE THING TO THROW INTO THE HEART OF THE INVESTIGATIONS, AS WAS NOTED. EXAMINING THE EXAMINATIONS OF A SUPREME COURT LAKE. THINK A LITTLE MORE OVERSIGHT OF THE COURT WOULD BE GOOD. MORE OVERSIGHT OF THE COURT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA THANKS VERY MUCH  THANK YOU, CHRIS.  THAT IS ALL IN ON THIS TUESDAY NIGHT, \"ALEX WAGNER TONIGHT\" STARTS WITH AYMAN MOHYELDIN IN FOR ALEX. GOOD EVENING, AYMAN.  GOOD EVENING, CHRIS THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ALEX A HAS THE NIGHT OFF. DURING THE 2016 CAMPAIGN, DONALD TRUMP GAVE A PLETHORA OF EXCUSES AS TO WHY HE WOULD BREAK DECADES OF PRECEDENT AND NOT RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS. HE SAID REPEATEDLY, I'M BEING AAUDITED SO I CAN'T. THEN THIS CLASSIC ONE QUOTE, I DON'T THINK ANYONE CARES.T THE ONLY ONES THAT MATTER ABOUT MY TAX RETURNS ARE THE REPORTERS. EVEN SAID A HANDFUL OF TIME, QUOTE, THERE'SL  NOTHING TO LEA FROM THEM. DEMOCRATS DID NOT AGREE WITH ANY OF THAT, IN FACT, DURING HIS PRESIDENCY, THERE WERE MULTIPLE HOUSE COMMITTEE REQUESTSPL OF TRUMP'S TAX RETUR, ALL TO NO AVAIL, BUT ONE COMMITTEE, THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE, A VERY POWERFUL COMMITTEE IN THE CONGRESS, BECAUSE IT IS A COMMITTEE THAT ACTUALLY OVERSEES TAX POLICIES AND TAXES IN GENERAL, THEY HAD SOMETHING OTHER G COMMITTEES DI NOT HAVE. IT A WRITTEN IN FEDERAL LAW THAT THE CHAIRMAN COULD REQUEST ANY TAXPAYERS' TAX RETURNS. SO, THEY HAD THE LAW ON THEIR SIDE WITH THEIR REQUEST. INR  APRIL, 2019, WHEN THE HOUS WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIR REQUESTED SIX YEARS OF THEN PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS ENTERPRISE TAX RETURNS, IT SEEMED LIKE AT THE TIME AN OPEN ANDAT SHUT CASE. CHAIRMAN RICHARD NEAL EXPLAINED AT THE TIME THAT HIS COMMITTEE NEEDS TO REQUEST TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS FOR QUOTE, LEGITIMATE, LEGISLATIVE, LEGAL AND OVERSIGHT PURPOSES. TO EXAMINE THE TAX RETURNS OF SITTING PRESIDENTS TO SEE WHAT, IF ANY, LAWS NEEDED TO BE AMENDED OR CLARIFIED. TO NO ONE'S SURPRISE, THE TRUMP TREASURY DEPARTMENT REFUSED TO HAND THEM OVER. AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE, A LEGAL BATTLE ENSUED. BUT THEN SOMETHING HAPPENED IN 2021. A NEW PRESIDENT TOOK OFFICE. AND THE DEAL WAS REACHED FOR THE COMMITTEE TO FINALLY GET THOSE TAX RETURNS. AND THEN, AS AGAIN, YOU CAN IMAGINE, TRUMPYO SUED THE COMMITTEE TO BLOCK THEM FROM OBTAINING THOSE TAX RETURNS. AND FINALLY, TODAY, AFTER A LONG COURT BATTLE, TODAY, JUST TODAY, THE COMMITTEE FINALLY GOT THEIR ANSWER. THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IN A TWO-SENTENCE ORDER DENIED TRUMP'S REQUEST TO BLOCK THE TAX RETURNS FROM BEING HANDED OVER. TRUMP'S LAST-DITCH ATTEMPT TO STOP THE COMMITTEE FROM OBTAINING THOSE TIGHTLY HELD TA RETURNS FAILED. AND NOW, THE COMMITTEE IS CLEAR TO GET THOSE SIX YEARS' WORTH OF TAX RETURNS FROM DONALD TRUMP AND SOME OF HIS BUSINESSES. BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY CLEAR AS TO WHEN THEY WILL GET THOSE TAX RETURNS. WHILE THAT ALL IS ALL WELCOME NEWS FOR HOUSE DEMOCRATS, THE REALITY IS THE CLOCK IS TICKING IN TERMS OF WHAT LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES THE COMMITTEE CAN RECOMMEND BYTI EXAMINING'S TRUMS TAX RETURNS. IN JUST 42 DAYS, THE NEW REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED CONGRESS WILL BE SWORN IN, AND DEMOCRATS WILL OFFICIALLY BE IN THE MINORITY,E  MEANING IN TERMS, T REPUBLICANS WILL SHUTER DOWN TH REQUEST FOR THE TAX RETURNS. TICKTOCK. OVER IN ONE OF THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS, INTO TRUMP, TODAY, A FEDERAL APPEALS COURT IN ATLANTA HEARD ARGUMENTS IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S APPEAL OF THE SPECIAL MASTER APPOINTMENT. YOU KNOW, THE SPECIAL MASTER THAT WASSTE  REVIEWING THE GOVERNMENT RECORDS FOUND AT MAR-A-LAGO. NOW, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TODAY, CALLING THE APPOINTMENT AN INTRUSION, ARGUING THAT THE TRUMP-NOMINATED JUDGE IN FLORIDA SHOULDMI NEVER HAVE APPOINTED A SPECIAL MASTER IN THE FIRST PLACE.RS THE THREE-JUDGE PANEL OF THE 11th CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEAL SEEMED POISE TO TOSS OUT THAT ORDER. HERE'S \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" REPORT ABOUT TODAY'S ARGUMENTS IN PART, READING, CHIEF JUDGE WILLIAM PRYOR SEEMED TO CRITICIZE TRUMP'S TEAM FOR ASKING FOR A SPECIAL MASTER WITHOUT PROVING THAT THE INITIAL SEARCH WAS ILLEGAL. IF YOU CAN'T ESTABLISH THAT IT WAS ANUNLAWFUL, HE SAID, THEN WT ARE WE DOING HERE? OUCH. WELL, WE DON'T KNOW WHEN A RULING WILL BE HANDED DOWN. IT COULD COME AT ANYTIME. BUT THE FACT IN THE LAST 42 DAYA OF BEING IN THE MAJORITY, DEMOCRATS HAVE FINALLY CLEARED THE WAY TO OBTAIN SIX YEARS OF TRUMP AND THEIR BUSINESSES AND THEIR TAX RETURNS. THAT IS A BIG DEAL, PERIOD. WHAT COULD THEY LEARN? WHAT DO THEY PLAN ON DOING WITH THAT INFORMATION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, WHEN WILL THEY GET THEIR HANDS ON THOSE TAX RETURNS? JOINING HE NOW IS CONGRESSMAN BILL PASQUAL HE'S A MEMBER OF THE WAYS AND MEANS AND CHAIR OF THE HOUSE OVERSIGHT. CONGRESSMAN PASCUAL, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. A VERY INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT TODAY. LET ME START ITI WITH THE PRESS QUESTION ON EVERYONE'S MIND. WHEN DO YOU EXPECT YOUR COMMITTEE TO RECEIVE DONALD TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS AND WILL IT BE BEFORE THE END OF THIS SESSION OF CONGRESS?  IT BETTER BE, AYMAN. IT BETTER BE, WE WAITED 1,329 DAYS, SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE LEGISLATION. I'M TELLING YOU, THAT'S GOING TO BE THE FIRST SUBJECT THAT COMES COMES UP WHEN WE GET BACK FROM THANKSGIVING. IT HAS TO HAPPEN. I TALKED TO RICHIE NEAL, HE'S DONE A GREAT JOB USING A DELIBERATIVE APPROACH, A FAIR APPROACH. THIS ISN'T ABOUT ONE MAN. THIS IS ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION. WE SAY IT ALL THE TIME. DO WE MEAN IT? AND WE'REAN SHOWING THAT WE MEA IT. I STARTED THIS QUEST IN FEBRUARY OF 2017. I INTRODUCED, WITH MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE CONGRESS 18 RESOLUTIONS. I ASKED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE AT THAT TIME, I VERY GOOD FRIEND FROM TEXAS, I ASKED THE CHAIRMAN, LET'S DO THIS TOGETHER. IN FEBRUARY OF 2017, THE PRESIDENT HAS ALREADY BEEN SWORN IN, LET'S DO IT TOGETHER. ANY QUESTION OF PARTISANSHIP. HE LAUGHED AT ME, I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER. BUT I PURSUED IT. BECAUSE THAT'S MY JOB. WHEN I'M ELECTED, WHEN I WAS ELECTED 25 YEARS AGO, MY JOB WAS TO WORK FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOT ONLY IN A DISTRICT I WAS ELECTED TO, BUT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. WE DON'T HAVE A CONSTITUTION FOR EVERY DISTRICT. THIS IS THE SAME CONSTITUTION. FOR THE ENTIRE NATION. AND I'M PROUD OF WHAT WE'VE DONE. AND I INTEND TO PURSUE GUARANTEED A WEEK FROM TODAY, WHEN WE GET BACK INTO THE CONGRESS, THAT WILL BE THE FIRST QUESTION ON MY MIND WHEN WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE MEETS. WE'RE NOT JOKING AROUND. NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW. HEAR ME, READ MY LIPS, MR. PRESIDENT, FORMER.  YEAH, VERY IMPORTANT WORDS. OBVIOUSLY, OVERSIGHT IS AN INCREDIBLE PART OF THIS. YOU JUST OUTLINED THAT THIS HAS BEEN YEARS IN THE MAKING, MY QUESTION TO YOU REALISTICALLY, WHEN DEMOCRATS GET THEIR HANDS ON THIS, OR WHEN THE CONGRESS OR COMMITTEE GETS THEIR HANDS ON THIS, YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO BE IN POWER FOR A FEW MORE WEEKS. REALISTICALLY, WHAT CAN WAYS AND MEANST  DO WITH THE INFORMATION THAT THE COMMITTEE GLEANS FROM THE TAXHE RETURNS.  6103, SUBSECTION J -- SUBSECTION F, I'M SORRY, IS VERY CLEAR. WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO SCREAM TO THE HEAVENS WHEN WE GET THIS DOCUMENT. WE HAVE TO HONOR IT, IT'S CONFIDENTIAL. WE WILL DECIDE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHAT WILL BE MADE OF IT. AND I BELIEVE THE ENTIRE NATION SHOULD HAVE THE MAIN KNOWLEDGE OFMA THIS REPORT OF WHAT HAPPEN AND HOW DID THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES USE THE JIBE ABOUT HANDING AN ORDER OF HIS OWN, PREVENT HIM FROM TELLING US, OR SHOWING US, LIKE EVERY PRESIDENT SINCE RICHARD NIXON, SHOW -- HAVE HIS INCOME TAX, TAX RETURNS, MADE PUBLIC. WE'LL DECIDE THAT. WE CAN'T JUST GO WILLY-NILLY, AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO IT. WE'VE HONORED THE LAW, THAT'S WHY WHEN I DUSTED OFF 6103, BACK IN 2017, NO ONE UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE HECK I WAS TALKING ABOUT. BECAUSE THAT -- WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH TAXEN LAW.  YEAH.  YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT HOW YOU PUT A BUDGET TOGETHER. ORDG WHETHER YOU TAX PEOPLE OR DON'T. IT'S THE LAW ITSELF. THERE ARE SOME CAVEATS, THAT ARE SOME VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGES IN THE TAX CODE. THAT'S OVER 100 YEARS OLD. BEFORE WE EVEN HAD THE INCOME TAX. OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS BACK THEN KNEW WHEN THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT. THE PUBLIC NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED. SOO  WHEN NIXON SAID I'M NOT A CROOK, WELL, SHOW US THEN YOUR TAX RETURNS. WE WANTTA TO KNOW IF THERE'S AN SPECIAL INTEREST IN THERE,W  TH PUBLIC HAS THE RIGHT TO KNOW HT THAT. THE PUBLIC HASO  A RIGHT TO KNO WHERE YOU'RE VESTED IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. THIS COUNTRY KNOWS RIGHT NOW WHAT THE DOLLARS PUT IN THE PAPERS WITHOUT HAVING THE TAXES IN FRONT OF US, WE KNOW THAT RICHARD NIXON, DONALD TRUMP MADE DEALS WITH THE OLIGARCHS IN EUROPE, ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND WHAT ARE THE COMMITMENTS THAT HE MADE?  RIGHT.  TO MR. PUTIN, OR THE OLIGARCHS INTH THE SOVIET UNIONS WHAT ARE THOSE COMMITMENTS. THAT'S ANOTHER DAY, SO I'M TELLING YOU, IN ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION, WE'LL BE ON IT, NEXT WEEK, WE'RE ALREADY ON IT DISCUSSING, BUT WHEN WE GET BACK TO COMMITTEE FORM, WE WILL DO THIS, AYMAN, THIS IS CRITICAL TO THE NATION. THIS ISTI A BIG DEAL. THIS IS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT.  INDEED, ALL VERY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AND ALLEGATIONS WORTH LOOKING INTO. AND WE'LL SEE AFTER NEXT WEEK WHAT COMES OF THESE TAX RETURNS. CONGRESSMAN BILL PASCRELL, MEMBER OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS AND CHAIR OF THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, THANK YOU, SIR, FOR JOINING US, APPRECIATE IT.  I WANT TO TURN TO A FORMER ACTING SOLICITOR FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. PROFESSOR AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY. NEAL, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. LET ME HONE IN ON TRUMP'S TAX RETURNS FOR YOU. IS IT SURPRISING TO YOU THAT THE COURT CLEARED THE WAY FOR THE HOUSE FOR THIS?  IT'S NOT SURPRISING. NOT A SINGLE JUDGE DISSENTED TODAY WHICH SAYS A LOT ABOUT TRUMP'S APPLICATION. IT REMINDS ME WHEN CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS WAS IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AND ONE DAY HE CALLED HIS CLIENT, I'VE GOT BAD NEWS, WE LOST 9-0, AND THE CLIENT SAYS, HOW COULD THAT BE? AND JUSTICE ROBERTS SAID THAT'S BECAUSE THERE WASN'T TEN SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ON THE COURT. NOTE NOTABLY LOSING ON THE JF COMMITTEE ON EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE 8 TO 1, AND IT'S SIGNIFICANT, BECAUSE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO HIDE THE TAX RETURNS FOR 8 1/2 YEARS. FIRST MODERN PRESIDENT TO DO SO AND THE SUPREME COURT IS HAVING NONE OF IT, NOT SURPRISING.NO  IN THE HEARING IN THE 11th CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS WITH THE SPECIAL MASTER CASE ANOTHER CASE WE'VE BEEN TRACKING, YOU TWEETED YOU DON'T THINK YOU'VE HEARD AN ORAL ARGUMENT GO WORSE FOR L SOMEONE. WHY DO YOU THINK THE HEARING WENT SO POORLY FOR TRUMP? YOU HAVE THIS ONE TODAY, YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT AS PRETTY BAD?  YEAH, YES, JUST FOR THE HE VIEWERS' SAKE, THIS IS A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING THAN THE TAX RETURNS. THIS ISHE ABOUT THE MAR-A-LAGO INVESTIGATION WHERE TRUMP STOLE A BUNCH OF DOCUMENTS, HIGHLY CLASSIFIED AND OTHERWISE. AND HESI 20 A JUDGE THAT HE BASICALLY SHOPPED FOR TO SAY I NEED A SPECIAL MASTER. AND HE GOT THAT SPECIAL MASTER BUT THESP GOVERNMENT SAID, HEY, WE'RED, GOING TO APPEAL THIS THING. AND TODAY WAS THE APPEAL. I'D SAY THAT THIS IS A TRAIN WRECK BUT I DON'T THINK THAT DOES JUSTICE FOR JUST HOW BADLY THAT WENT FOR TRUMP TODAY. IN THE PERIL OF EVERYTHING THAT TRUMP'S LAWYERS SAID. AND I DON'TS  THINK IT'S ABOUT TRUMP'S LAWYER BY THE WAY, TRUMP'S LAWYER IS A GOOD LAWYER, IT'S NOT THAT. N IT'S JUST HIS ARGUMENT WAS HORRIBLE. HE HAD TO DEFEND THE INDEFENSIBLE. HE HAD TO DEFEND THIS JUDGE, JUDGE CANON, WHO WROTE A RULING THAT WAS TOTALLY BONKERS. WE CAN PREDICT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHICH IS THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO GET WHAT IT WANTS TO END IS THE SPECIAL MASTER ENTHING. THEY'RE NOT AFRAID OF THE SPECIAL MASTER. THE SPECIAL MASTER IS A GREAT JUDGE, JUDGE DEARIE, NOBODY GETS TO HAVE A FEDERAL JUDGE AS A SPECIAL MASTER OVERSEE THEIR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. THERE'S LITERALLY NO PRECEDENT FOR IT. TRUMP COULD COME UP, OR A LAWYER COME UP IN A SINGLE TIME IN AMERICAN HISTORY THAT'S EVER HAPPENED SO THEY'RE GOING TO LOSE. THE SPECIAL MASTER WILL BE OVER. AND THEN THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION INTO DONALD TRUMP ABOUT STEALING THESE CLASSIFIED AND NATIONAL SECURITY DOCUMENTS CAN PROCEED.  IF I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, AND YOU CERTAINLY KNOW MORE ABOUT HIS LEGAL STRATEGY THAN I DO, IT SEEMS LIKE THIS WILL PROBABLY GET APPEALED TO THE SUPREME COURT. SO, HOW SOON WOULD YOU EXPECT TO GET A RULING FROM THE 11th CIRCUIT? AND DO YOU ANTICIPATE, AS HE HAS DONE TIME AND TIME AGAIN, AS A DELAY TACTIC, NOT AS A LEGAL ARGUMENT THAT HE WILL TRY TO TAKE THIS TO THE SUPREME COURT JUST TO PUT A PAUSE ON IT?  YEAH, HE'S GOING TO TRY. I SUSPECT HE'LL LOSE EXACTLY LIKE HE LOST TODAY, 9-0, HERE THERE'S MORE TIME THAN THE TAX RETURN THING BECAUSE HERE, AYMAN, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS AT LEAST D UNDER MERRICK GARLAN FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND PRESIDENT BIDEN SO THERE'S NO WRAY TO TRUNCATE THAT CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. WITH THE TAX RETURNS,CA THAT YO WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE IT CONGRESSMAN, THE HOUSE IS GOING TO SWITCH SECONTROL, AND THESE X RETURNS ARE ONLY BEING GIVEN TO THE HOUSE. THAT SUGGESTS TO ME TWO THINGS. NUMBER ONE, IT SEEMS TO ME THE HOUSE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO WORK WITH THE SENATE TO TRANSFER THIS TAX INVESTIGATION TO THE SENATE WHEN CONTROL CHANGES, SO THAT THIS INFORMATION WON'T ALL BE BURIED AND NEVER SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY. AND NUMBER TWO, WITH RESPECT TO THE WOCONGRESSMAN, I PREET THAT HE'S SO FORTH RIGHT, BUT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T SEE WHY THEY'RE WAITING FOR THANKSGIVING. I THINK THEY SHOULD BE IN THERE TOMORROW, DEMANDING THESE DOCUMENTS, CANCEL THANKSGIVING. THESE DOCUMENTS ARE IMPORTANT. THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING THROUGH THESED  DOCUMENTS RIGHT NOW. THE CLOCK IST  TICKING.  PART OF ME WISHES I WOULD HAVE SPOKEN TO YOU BEFORE BILL PASCRELL SO I COULD TURN AROUND AND ASK HIM, WILL YOU TRANSFER THOSE TAX DOCUMENTS TO THE SENATE TOTH CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION. NEAL, WE'RE ALWAYSVE APPRECIATI OF YOUR INSIGHTS, RIGHTFULLY SO, YOU CAN SEE. ALWAYS A PLEASURE, MY FRIEND, GOOD TO SEE YOU.  THANK YOU.  NEAL COX ACTING SOLICITOR GENERAL DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION NOW AT GEORGETOWN. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. IN JUST A MOMENT, WE'RE GOING TO TALK LIVE TO RICHARD JAMES, ONE OF THE HEROES THAT HELPED SUBDUE THE GUNMAN THAT NIGHT. AND SAVED MANY, MANY MORE LIVES.

        "trs": "TODAY THE SECOND WOMAN ALLEGING SHE HAD AN ABORTION AT THE URGING OF TRUMP ENDORSED SENATOR CANDIDATE HERSCHEL WALKER CAME FORWARD WITH WHAT SHE CLAIMS TO BE NEW EVIDENCE COURTING THEIR RELATIONSHIP. SHE APPEARED ON CAMERA ALTHOUGH SHE DID NOT DISCLOSE YOUR NAME. SHE SAID SHE WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH WALKER FOR SIX YEARS AND DECIDED TO COME FORWARD AFTER SHE HEARD HIS DENIALS.  HERSCHEL, I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD DENY KNOWINGLY OR OUR RELATIONSHIP. ARE YOU REALLY WILLING TO DO ANYTHING INCLUDING LYING TO THE VOTERS IN GEORGIA TO BECOME A SENATOR?  I SHOULD NOTE, THIS WOMAN UNLIKE THE FIRST WOMAN THAT ACCUSED WALKER DIDN'T PRESENT EVIDENCE SPECIFICALLY SHOWING THAT WALKER PUSH FOR PAID FOR AN ABORTION AS HIS PREVIOUS ACCUSERS DID. HOWEVER, SHE DID PRESENT PREVIOUSLY VIEWED NOT VIEWED PHOTOS OF WALKER AND HERSELF, AS PROOF OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP. WALKER SAYS BOTH WOMEN ARE LYING. AND D.C. NEWS IS NOT INDEPENDENTLY VERIFIED HER CLAIMS. ALL THIS COMES JUST TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE GEORGIA RUNOFF BETWEEN WALKER AND INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK. THE THING IS, THAT RACE IS NO LONGER ABOUT WHICH PARTY WILL CONTROL THE U.S. SENATE, WHAT DEMOCRATS CAN DO WITH THE 51 VOTE MAJORITY. AS WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST GREG SERGEANT WRITES TODAY, HAVING 51 SENATORS AS OPPOSED TO 50 WOULD GIVE DEMOCRATS SOLE CONTROL OVER INVESTIGATION AS TRUMP'S CORRUPTION WAS THEY CAN DO TO COUNTER THE CLOWN SHOW HEARINGS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY AND CONGRESS. IF WE'RE INVESTIGATING LEGITIMATE ISSUES WHILE THEY'RE FIXATED ON HUNTER BIDEN'S LIP TOP, WE'LL BE DOING OUR JOB, AND WILL BE WINNING THE BATTLE PUBLIC OPINION. JOINING US NOW IS A FORMER SENIOR ADVISER OF THE LATE SENATOR HARRY REID OF NEVADA. HE'S CURRENTLY SENATOR ADVISER FOR SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS FROM VERMONT. YOU'VE WORKED IN THE SENATE FOR MANY YEARS IN DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS IN TERMS OF THE MAJORITY AND MINORITY. FOR FOLKS WHO DON'T KNOW THE INSTITUTION, HOW BIG A DIFFERENCE WOULD BE TO GO FROM THE 50 VOTE MINORITY OF THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE TIE BREAKING VOTE OF KAMALA HARRIS TO A 51 VOTE MAJORITY.  IT MATTERS A BIG DEAL CHRIS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COMPOSITION OF THESE COMMITTEES, WHETHER TALKING THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE, ON A SECURITY COMMITTEE, HEALTH LABOR PENSIONS COMMITTEE. WHEN YOU 50/50, THE VOTES ARE SPLIT. NOW IMAGINE IF YOU HAD 51 SENATORS IN THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS. THE VOTES ON THE COMMITTEE CHANGE. THEY BECOME A MAJORITY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY BECOME A MAJORITY ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE AND EVERY ONE OF THOSE COMMITTEES, THEY GET TO SET THE RULES OF THESE COMMITTEES. NOW WHEN YOU THINK OF ONE OF THE RULES OF THE COMMITTEES, DOES A COMMITTEE HAVE SUBPOENA POWER FOR INSTANCE? COULD IT CALL THE HEAD OF A PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY TO TESTIFY ABOUT THE ARRANGES COST OF INSULIN FOR INSTANCE? YES YOU COULD DO THAT UNDER A DEMOCRATIC SENATE WITH 51 VOTES BECAUSE THE COMPOSITION OF VOTES WOULD BE ALLOWED TO GOVERN FOR DEMOCRATS.  LAST TIME AROUND, THERE WAS THIS REALLY WEIRD INTERIM PERIOD, I THINK WAS JANUARY 5TH THAT THEY STARTED TO RUN OFF HAPPENED, AND THEY BOTH HEADWINDS FOR DEMOCRATS. SO THERE WAS GONNA BE A 50 SEAT SLIMMEST MAJORITY FOR DEMOCRATS. THERE WAS A DEAL THAT HAD TO BE WORKED OUT WITH MCCONNELL BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD POWER, THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT OUTRIGHT MAJORITY IN IT MEANT THAT THERE WERE SOME LIMITATIONS TO WHAT THE NORMAL WORKINGS OF A MAJORITY WOULD LOOK LIKE?  YES THAT'S RIGHT. IN MANY WAYS THE COMMITTEES WERE HAMPERED BY THIS BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T BE A VERY ACTIVE COMMITTEE, BUT NEVERTHELESS DEMOCRATS PERSEVERED THROUGH IT AND AS WE KNOW, THEY HAD A GOOD LEGISLATIVE SESSION, WHICH SEES A BUNCH OF RECONCILIATION TO THEIR ADVANTAGE, SOMETHING LIKE A PASSIVE 50 VOTES. IT BECOMES A LITTLE STRONGER WITH 51 VOTES, BUT YOU'RE STILL HAMPERED BY THE FACT THAT IN THE HOUSE THERE WOULD BE A HOUSE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY. THE OTHER THING WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT CHRIS'S NOMINATIONS. A LOT OF THESE NOMINEES WOULD BE PUT UP FOR VOTES. WHEN YOU HAVE 51 VOTES, FILLON FCC AND HAVE A DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY THERE. TO HAVE JUDICIAL NOMINEES PASS, IT'S ALWAYS HELPFUL TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A CUSHION. SOMETIMES EVEN FOR ATTENDANCE REASONS CHRIS. IF SOMEONE HAPPENS TO BE SICK RIGHT? THEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AT LEAST 50 VOTES.  AS SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN THE SENATE AND KNOW YOUR CLOSE TO SENATOR SANDERS AND WORKED FOR SENATOR REID, HOW DO YOU VIEW THIS PERIOD? WHETHER IT'S 50 OR 51 AND 51 WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE OF THIS DEMOCRATIC-CONTROLLED SENATE FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS, WHICH HONESTLY, I'M NOT SURE A TON OF PEOPLE WERE COUNTING ON, THEY WERE HOPING FOR NOT BACKING. ANNA  WE SHOULD ALL FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE FACT THAT A BIDEN COALITION SHOWED UP VOTER NOT ONLY 2020 BUT ALL, ALSO IN 2022. THERE'S LOTS TO BE PLEASED ABOUT. THE STATE OF THE SITUATION. I THINK WHEN YOU HEAD INTO THE NEXT TWO YEARS AS PLEASED AS I AM, WE GOTTA THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE POPULAR VOTE WENT AGAINST US IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO STILL RECKON WITH THE THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. HOW DO WE IMPROVE? I THINK THE PATH FOR DEMOCRATIC MAJORITIES TO BUILD ON THAT AND IN THE HOUSE AND MAINTAIN THE PRESIDENCY IS THROUGH WORKING CLASS VOTERS. ONE OF THE WAYS YOU CAN DO THAT IS A THINK THE CONTRAST IS CLEAR NOW, BECAUSE IF YOU THINK BACK IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, JOE BIDEN HAD TO LARGELY CHALLENGE HIS OWN PARTY AT EVERY TURN TO TRY TO GET THE VOTES NEEDED TO PASS AN AGENDA. NOW YOU'VE GOT A FOIL AND A CONTRAST OUT OF KEVIN MCCARTHY THAT'S GONNA BE A BIT OF A CLOWN SHOW IN THE HOUSE SIDE. IF YOU HAVE YOUR ACT TOGETHER AND YOU'RE RUNNING WHAT YOU THINK IS THE APPROPRIATE AGENDA THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ADDICT CARES ABOUT. YOU'RE INVESTIGATING THINGS, CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY, TICKETMASTER, LET'S GO EXPOSE THEIR GREED AND THEIR EXCUSE CORRUPTION AS A MONOPOLY, LET'S GO TO GAS PRICES IN STOCK DIVIDENDS THAT OCCUR FROM OIL COMPANIES. THESE ARE ALL OPPORTUNITIES TO SHOWCASE HERE'S AN AGENDA THAT ACTUALLY SPEAKS TO YOUR PAIN AND SUFFERING AND HERE'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO, AND OVER THERE IS A JOKE ON THE OTHER SIDE.  THAT'S A GOOD POINT. IT ALSO MAKES ME REALIZE HOW LITTLE, HOW STRONG THOSE COMMITTEES WERE DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS, WHICH HAD REALLY SERVED. EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A LOT OF LEGISLATING BEING DONE AND A LOT OF NOMINEES, PARTICULARLY JUDICIAL NOMINEES GETTING CONFIRMED, HOW MUCH -- WHERE DO YOU THINK THE NEXT TWO WEEKS, WHO THIS CAMPAIGN SITUATION FEVERS IN GEORGIA BETWEEN WARNOCK AND WALKER?  WE ARE IN A VERY STRONG POSITION. IT'S ALL REALLY A MATTER OF TURNOUT. IT SEEMS LIKE THE POLLS EACH DAY CONTINUE TO SHOW STRENGTH ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. THE TURNOUT OPERATION HAS THUS FAR BEEN GOOD AND TESTED A COUPLE OF TIMES IN GEORGIA AS YOU KNOW IN 2020. CHRIS, WHEN YOU THINK BACK TO 2020, WHEN JOHN OSSOFF, AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK WON IN GEORGIA, REMEMBER WE HAD A STIMULUS CHECK DEBATE AT THAT TIME. I THINK IT'S CONTINUALLY IMPORTANT FOR DEMOCRATS TO CONTINUALLY OFFER WORKING CLASS SOLUTIONS AND IDEAS THAT THEY WANT TO PUT FORWARD THAT A PROACTIVE. NOT JUST REST IN THE FACT THEY HAVE A LOONY BIN TO KIND OF DEBATE ON THE OTHER SIDE. YES THAT'S WORKING TO OUR VANTAGE, BUT LET'S CONTINUE TO PRESS THE CASE AND HERE'S A WORKING CLASS AGENDA LIKE THE STIMULUS CHECKS OF 2020, THAT WE'RE GONNA END|20221123015955|2022-11-23_0100_US_MSNBC_All_In_With_Chris_Hayes ",

        "trs": "\u266a\u266a > IN MY EXPERIENCE AROUND POLITICS, WHEN YOU FIND HYPOCRISY IN THE DAYLIGHT, LOOK FOR POWER IN THE SHADOWS. THE TERM FOR THIS ANONYMOUS FUNDING POURING BY THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO POLITICS IS DARK MONEY. THIS SHOWS CONSIDERABLE EFFORT WHEN SOMEBODY GOES TO THAT MUCH TROUBLE TO CREATE THAT MANY ORGANIZATIONS TO HIDE HOW MUCH MONEY THEY'VE SPENT TO CONTROL THE NOMINATION PROCESS TO THE COURT. > HI, AGAIN, EVERYONE. IT'S 5:00 IN THE EAST. FOR YEARS SENATOR SHELDON WHITEHOUSE HAS BEEN WARNING ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF DARK MONEY IN THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. HOW DONORS HAVE CONTRIBUTED MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY TO SERVE WHO GETS TO CONTROL FOR LIFE ON THE BENCH. HE'S MADE SPEECHES ON THE SENATE FLOOR. HE ADDRESSED IT DURING SUPREME COURT CONFIRMATION HEARINGS. HE WROTE A BOOK ABOUT IT WHICH IS WHY \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" POSTED REPORTING ABOUT AN ALLEGED LEAK BY A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE. HE TWEETED, AT SCOTUS THE PROBLEMS RUN DEEP. THIS IS A STORY WE COVERED AT THIS MOMENT IN THE SHOW YESTERDAY. WE'RE GOING TO BACK TO IT AND GO DEEPER TODAY BECAUSE OF ITS IMPORTANCE TO THE HEALTH OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND ITS DEMOCRACY. THE TIMES REPORTS THE ACTIONS OF THE REVEREND ROB SHANK. HE SAID HE WAS TOLD OF A SUPREME COURT DECISION WEEKS BEFORE IT WAS ANNOUNCED AUTHORED BY JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO THAT RULED IN FAVOR FOR HOBBY LOBBY FOR THE RIGHT TO CONTRACEPTIVES. FAST FORWARD TO THE SUMMER AND SHANK TOLD CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS ABOUT THIS LEAK SAYING HE WAS PASSING IT ALONG IN CASE IT HELPS WITH ROBERTS' INVESTIGATION INTO THE LEAK OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE. WHAT WAS SO STRIKING IS HOW IT DETAILS SHANK'S PLANNING TO WOO AND INFLUENCE THE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES. QUOTE, MR. SHANK RECRUITED WEALTHY DONORS, ENCOURAGING THEM TO INVITE JUSTICES TO MEALS, THEIR VACATION HOMES OR PRIVATE CLUBS. HE ADVISED ALLIES TO CONTRIBUTE MONEY AND TO MINGLE WITH JUSTICES AT THEIR FUNCTIONS. HE INGRATIATED HIMSELF WITH COURT OFFICIALS. MR. SHANK WANTED THE CONSERVATIVES ON THE COURT TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO HAILED THEM AS HEROS IF THEY SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STRIKE DOWN ROE. THE GOAL HE SAID WAS TO, QUOTE, EMBOLDEN THE JUSTICES, TO LAY THE LEGAL GROUNDWORK FOR A REVERSAL BY DELIVERING UNAPOLOGETIC CONSERVATIVE DISSENTS. SENATOR WHITEHOUSE AND HANK JUSTICE WROTE A LETTER DEMANDING ANSWERS. THIS IS WHERE WE BEGIN WITH SENATOR WHITEHOUSE OF RHODE ISLAND. IN SOME WAYS IT'S EMBARRASSING HOW RIGHT YOU HAVE BEEN AND HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN RIGHT ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT. IN THAT SPIRIT, I DO HAVE TO ASK YOU IF YOU BELIEVE CHANGE IS POSSIBLE, IF YOU BELIEVE THESE TWO STORIES WILL HELP CHANGE AN INSTITUTION SO AVERSE TO REFORM?  I THINK SO. I THINK THAT AS PUBLIC PRESSURE BUILDS AND AS PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING BUILDS OF THE ACTUAL PROBLEMS AT THE SUPREME COURT THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND LISTED, THEN THE COURT IS GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS OWN ETHICS AND OWN BEHAVIOR AND COME OUT OF THE ETHICS-FREE ZONE IT'S INHABITED AND BE RESPONSIBLE ABOUT ASSURING THAT, WHEN ETHICS CONCERNS ARE RAISED, THERE'S SOME KIND OF PROCESS WHERE COMPLAINTS CAN GO, WHERE FACTS ARE FOUND, WHERE DETERMINATION ARE MADE AND REPORTS ARE PRODUCED THAT EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING ON AND CLEARLY THE QUESTION OF THIS LEAK IS SOMETHING THAT MERITS SCRUTINY. SO, BY THE WAY, DOES THE LARGER PROBLEM OF THIS SCRIPTED AND ORCHESTRATED SERIES OF DINNERS DESIGNED TO MANIPULATE THE COURT. THIS FROM JUSTICE ALITO AND HIS LARGER CAMPAIGN OF INFLUENCE, WHICH IS JUST ONE THREAD, ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED INTO. THAT'S THE POINT.  YOU KNOW, WITHOUT YOUR EXPERTISE, FROM THE OUTSIDE, THE COURT SEEMS TO HAVE SORT OF A THREE-RING CIRCUS OF PROBLEMS THAT JEOPARDIZE ITS TRUST IN THE PUBLIC VIEW. ONE IS WHAT YOU FOCUSSED ON FOR SO LONG, THE DARK MONEY AND THE FUNNELING OF MONEY FROM RICH INDIVIDUALS TO PEOPLE WHO ARE PART OF THE FEDERAL SOCIETY WHO HAVE ZERO OVERSIGHT WHO MAINLINE AND PULL THE STRINGS OF THE PROCESS. THE SECOND IS WHAT JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR TALKED ABOUT THE STENCH OF PUBLIC LEGISLATORS SAYING THEY'RE PASSING THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE OF THE JUDGES THAT TRUMP HAS APPOINTED. FIRST, YOUR TAKE ON THE MONEY.  THE CURE TO THE MONEY PROBLEM IS DISCLOSURE. IT SHOULDN'T BE OKAY FOR SOMEBODY TO SPEND $15 MILLION OR $17 MILLION AND SEND IT TO THE JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK AND HAVE THE JUDICIAL CRISIS NETWORK, WHICH IS RIGHT DOWN THE HALL FROM THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY, RUN TV ADS FOR NOMINEES WHO GET ON THE BENCH AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT BUSINESS THE CHECK WRITER, THE 15 OR $17 MILLION CHECK WRITER HAS BEFORE THE COURT. THAT IS POTENTIALLY BY THE COURT'S OWN TERMS A DUE PROCESS PROBLEM. THE FIRST STEP TO CURING IT IS TO DISCLOSE IT AND THAT INFORMATION SHOULD BE PUBLIC JUST IN THE INTEREST OF THE COURT'S INTEGRITY.  ON THAT, HAS THE COURT EVER INDICATED ANY -- HAS IT EVER BEEN RECEPTIVE TO REFORMING A SIMPLE ISSUE OF TRANSPARENCY THAT THE OTHER BRANCHES ARE HELD TO?  NOT AT ALL. THEY'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THE RULE IT IS WAY THEY ARE. THEY WOULDN'T EVEN TRY TO CLEAN UP DISCLOSURE OF WHO IS BEHIND THE GROUPS THAT FILE AMICUS BRIEFS SO YOU DON'T HAVE SPECIAL INTERESTS SENDING THINGS THROUGH EIGHT OR TEN OR FIFTY AT A TIME. LUCKILY THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS HAS TAKEN INTEREST IN THAT AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT THAT SAYING IT'S WRONG, WE HAVE TO FIX IT. AT THE SUPREME COURT, JUST SCREAMING SILENCE.  IT'S AMAZING. THE SECOND PIECE IS OBVIOUSLY LINKED TO THAT. I MEAN, I REMEMBER WHEN JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR TALKED ABOUT THE STENCH. SHE WASN'T INSULTING HER FELLOW JUSTICES. SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE REPUBLICANS AND STATE LEGISLATORS PASSING ABORTION BANS BECAUSE GORSUCH, KAVANAUGH AND CONEY BARRETT WERE NOW JUSTICES. SHE TALKED ABOUT THE STENCH OF THE STATE LEGISLATIVE POLICY BECAUSE OF THAT. CASEY AND ROE WERE DECIDED BY JUSTICES NOMINATED BY REPUBLICANS. WE'VE NEVER HAD THESE VOTING BLOCKS BEFORE. HOW DO YOU FIX THAT?  THE GROUPS AROUND THEM AREN'T EXACTLY SUBTLE ABOUT DECLARING VICTORY AND POINTING OUT WHAT THEY WANT TO ACHIEVE POLITICALLY. THEY'RE DEGRADING THE COURT'S AUTHORITY AS THEY DO THAT, BUT THEY CAN'T RESIST BECAUSE IT'S STUFF THEY FAILED AT DEMOCRATICALLY FOR SO LONG. NOW WITH A CAPTURED COURT THEY CAN GET DONE WHAT THEY WANTED WITHOUT DEMOCRATIC SCRUTINY AND THEY CAN DO IT THROUGH PEOPLE WHO HAVE JOBS FOR LIFE AND NO CONSEQUENCES. THE CHEERING SECTION IS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE COURT. THE COURT ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTES TO THIS BY ALLOWING SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS TO RUSH CASES TO THEM OFTEN UPON THE INVITATION OF SOME OF THE JUSTICES. THEY'VE CREATED A FAST LANE FOR CASES TO COME TO THE COURT WITH WEIRD SIGNALS LIKE PLAINTIFFS WHO COME INTO THE DISTRICT COURT AND SAY, PLEASE, YOUR HONOR, I WOULD LIKE TO LOSE AND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND GO UP TO THE CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS SAYING YOUR HONOR WE WANT TO LOSE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THEY'RE IN A RUSH TO GET IN FRONT OF FRIENDLY JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COURT. THAT'S NOT WHAT REAL LITIGATION LOOKS LIKE. IT'S A STENCHY SIGNAL THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG. THAT SOMETHING THE COURTS PARTICIPATE IN.  IT'S AMAZING. THEY GO OUT AND GIVE SPEECHES AND SEEM BOTH POUTY AND SURPRISED.  AT THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY.  AND COMPLAIN THAT THE PUBLIC DOESN'T LIKE THEM AS MUCH AS THEY DID IN 2000 WHICH ON THE HEELS OF BUSH V GORE, 60% OF AMERICANS APPROVED OF THE COURT AND NOW THEY'RE DOWN TO 28%. DO YOU SEE ANY RECOVERY OF THEIR REPUTATION WITHOUT REFORMING EITHER OF THESE TWO BUCKETS?  NO. I THINK THEY NEED TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT REFORM. PRETENDING THAT NOTHING IS GOING ON THERE IS NOT WORKING FOR THEM. THEY NOW FACE A CHOICE THAT MANY OF THEM WISH THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO FACE. THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE THEIR MASTER. THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY'LL SERVE THE DONOR WHO PUT THEM ON THE COURT OR SERVE THE PATH OF JUSTICE AND CALL BALLS AND STRIKES FOR REAL AND HONOR PRECEDENT AND FOLLOW ORIGINALISM WHEREVER IT LEADS, EVEN IF IT LEADS AWAY FROM CORPORATE INTERFERENCE AND DARK MONEY. THIS IS GOING TO BE AN EPIC CHOICE FOR THEM. IT'S THE FUTURE INTEGRITY AND LEGITIMACY OF THE COURT WILL DEPEND ON IN LARGE MEASURE.  YOU LOOK AT CLARENCE THOMAS AND HIS WIFE GINNI THOMAS AND HER ADMITTED PARTICIPATE IN THE FAKE ELECTOR SCHEME. SPOUSES CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT I SUPPOSE. THE PROBLEM AND THE STENCHY PART OF IT SEEMS TO BE JUSTICE THOMAS' VOTING RECORD AND HIS PARTICIPATION IN THE JANUARY 6th SELECT COMMITTEE. WHAT DO YOU DO ABOUT JUSTICE THOMAS?  THIS IS A DOUBLE DECKER PROBLEM. THE FIRST PROBLEM IS HIS EXCUSE FOR NOT RECUSING HIMSELF IN THE ORIGINAL CASE WAS THAT HE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT HIS WIFE WAS UP TO IN THE INSURRECTION PLOT. BELIEVE THAT OR NOT, IT IS A FACTUAL QUESTION. FACTUAL QUESTIONS LEND THEMSELVES INTO INQUIRY. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INQUIRY INTO THAT. IF CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS CAN LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHO LEAKED THE ALITO/DOBBS DRAFT, HE CAN LAUNCH AN INVESTIGATION INTO WHAT JUSTICE THOMAS KNEW AND WHEN HE KNEW IT. THERE'S A PROBLEM REFUSING TO ENFORCE THE CODE OF ETHICS OR LOOK AT THE FACTS TO SEE WHERE THIS FITS AGAINST THE CODE OF ETHICS. THEN YOU GET TO THE RECENT CASE WHERE HE VOTED AGAIN IN A RELATED MATTER. NOW WE KNOW THAT HE DOES KNOW WHAT HIS WIFE WAS UP TO BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW WHAT HIS WIFE WAS UP TO BECAUSE IT'S BEEN FRONT PAGE NEWS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. STILL NO RECUSAL. THAT RAISES A DIFFERENT PROBLEM, BUT BOTH NEED ADDRESSED BY THE COURT AND BOTH CAN BE FACILITATED IF THERE WAS SOME PROCESS WHERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LEGITIMATE CONCERN COULD GET A LEGITIMATE INQUIRY AND LEGITIMATE REPORT.  I DIDN'T PRODUCE IT FOR TODAY, BUT THE RECENT MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT ALL AFFIRM THEIR COMMITMENT TO PRECEDENT. THEY DESCRIBE ROE AS PRECEDENT, LAW OF THE LAND. THEY ALL VOTED TO OVERTURN IT. WOULD YOU CONSIDER BOYCOTTING CONFIRMATION HEARINGS? HAVE THEY BEEN RENDERED MEANING LESS? WHAT CAN THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH DO TO NOT BE PLAYED BY THESE NOMINEES WHO GO IN AND SAY WHATEVER THEY SAY BUT DON'T ABIDE BY IT ONCE THEY GET TO THE BENCH?  THE PROBLEM AT HEART IS THE PROBLEM OF DARK MONEY. IF YOU ACCEPT MY PROPOSITION THAT THE SAME INTERESTS THAT SPENT MORE THAN $500 MILLION TO GET A MAJORITY ON THE SUPREME COURT THAT WOULD DO ITS BIDDING AND THAT THEY ALSO CONTRIBUTE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF DARK MONEY THROUGH OUTSIDE EXPENDITURES AND SUPER PACKS TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, PARTICULARLY TO MITCH McCONNELL'S SENATE SPENDING GROUPS, THEN YOU HAVE THIS SORT OF PERFECT STORM IN WHICH HEARINGS AREN'T GOING TO BE REAL BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S STRINGS ARE BEING PULLED BY THE SAME DONORS. IT'S HARD TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM UNLESS YOU PUT THE LIGHTS ON AND SHOW WHERE THE DARK MONEY IS COMING FROM AND EVERYBODY HAS TO BE ACCOUNTABLE.  I'M SO GLAD YOU MENTIONED MITCH McCONNELL. IT'S A PIECE OF POETIC SOMETHING THAT THE SUPREME COURT WAS SUCH A POLITICAL DEAD WEIGHT THAT HE REMAINS MINORITY LEADER OF THE U.S. SENATE. SENATOR WHITEHOUSE, THANK YOU FOR SPENDING TIME WITH US AND TALKING ABOUT THIS.  THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON. > JOINING OUR CONVERSATION JOYCE VANCE AND CHARLIE SYKES. THEY ARE BOTH MSNBC CONTRIBUTORS. IT MATTERS, CHARLIE, THAT MITCH McCONNELL IS THE PUPPET MASTER OF THIS EXACT COMPOSITION OF THE SUPREME COURT AND IT COST HIM A SENATE MAJORITY. IT MATTERS BECAUSE TO THE SENATOR'S POINT IT'S ALL CONNECTED. THEY'RE ALL THE SAME DONORS.  IT IS. LEONARD LEO PLAYED A MASSIVE ROLE THERE. THIS IS A REAL ETHICAL CRISIS FOR THE SUPREME COURT THEY CAN'T AVOID. JOHN ROBERTS IS AN INSTITUTIONALIST WHO CAME TO THE CHIEF JUSTICE POSITION DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE COURT AND YET LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT JUST THE STORY OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. IT'S A STORY OF STATE SUPREME COURTS, LOWER COURTS ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY, THE INFLUENCE OF BILLIONAIRES, RICH DONORS AND THE IRONY HERE THAT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MITCH McCONNELL IS NOT THE MAJORITY LEADER IS BECAUSE THIS COURT HAS BECOME SO IDEOLOGICAL. THE SENATOR RAISED FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF THE COURT, WHETHER YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT, LIBERAL, REPUBLICAN OR INDEPENDENT, YOU OUGHT TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ISSUES HE'S RAISING. THE FACT THERE'S NO DISCLOSURE. THE FACT WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE WRITING THESE MASSIVE CHECKS HAVE BUSINESS IN FRONT OF THE COURT. WHETHER THE COURT HAS BEEN SO POLITICIZED THAT IT'S BEING INFLUENCED. THESE ARE REAL ISSUES NOT GOING AWAY. I'M GLAD THAT OTHER JUDGES ARE TAKING IT MORE SERIOUSLY. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO SHINE THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE RELUCTANCE OF THE SUPREME COURT TO GET SEER KYLE RITTENHOUSE ABOUT HAVING AN ETHICS CODE THAT APPLIES TO ITSELF.  THE SENATOR SAID HE HAS SOME OPTIMISM REFORMS ARE POSSIBLE. DO YOU THINK THEY'RE LIKELY, JOYCE?  IT'S A TOUGH CALL. EVERYTHING THAT SENATOR WHITEHOUSE SAYS IS ABSOLUTE COMMON SENSE. IF YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THE SUPREME COURT, IF YOU'VE RISEN TO THAT HIGH OFFICE, WOULDN'T YOU WANT THE PUBLIC TO HOLD THAT COURT IN HIGH CONFIDENCE? WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO HAVE THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN YOUR INTEGRITY? BY REFUSING TO HAVE AN ETHICAL CODE, A CODE THAT EVERY OTHER JUDGE IN THE COUNTRY LIVES WITH, THE JUSTICES HOLD THEMSELVES OUT FOR THE SITUATION THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN, WHERE PUBLIC RESPECT HAS PLUMMETED. HERE'S THE PROBLEM, THERE'S NOT REALLY A STICK IN THAT AREA BECAUSE THE SEPARATION OF POWERS WOULD MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR CONGRESS TO COME IN AND WRITE AN ETHICS CODE THAT THEY WOULD FORCE ON TO THE COURT. UNLESS THE JUSTICES THEMSELVES AGREE TO ADOPT AN ETHICS CODE, THERE'S NOT ANYONE WHO CAN FORCE THEM TO DO IT. IT'S TOUGH TO BELIEVE THE CHIEF JUSTICE HAS NOT BROACHED THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH HIS COLLEAGUES. IT MUST BE THAT THERE ARE ONE OR MORE JUSTICES UNWILLING TO ADOPT A CODE. IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR A COURT TO HAVE A DIVIDED VOTE HERE. YOU CAN IMAGINE THE RANCOR AND HOW THAT WOULD SPILL OVER ANDY DIMINISH PUBLIC CONFIDENCE. I THINK SENATOR WHITEHOUSE IS CORRECT. SOMETHING MUST BE DONE HERE. THE SITUATION HAS BOILED OVER INTO THE PUBLIC IN SUCH AN EXTREME WAY THAT HOW THE CHIEF JUSTICE IS GOING TO FINESSE THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.  I WILL JUST SAY I HAVE WORKED IN INSTITUTIONS, NEVER AS LOW AS 28%, BUT WITH LOW PUBLIC ESTEEM IN MY CAREER IN REPUBLICAN POLITICS. IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING CRISIS MEETINGS 24/7 TO DEAL WITH HAVING 28% APPROVAL, THEN YOU'RE PART OF THE CRISIS OF THAT INSTITUTION. I WOULD BE SHOCKED IF THERE AREN'T ACTIVE CONVERSATIONS. IT'S NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE COURT OR ANYONE ON IT OR THE COUNTRY FOR THEM TO BE OKAY SITTING AT 28%. THAT'S HALF THE PEOPLE WHO IDENTIFY AS INDEPENDENT. IT'S AN ASTONISHINGLY LOW NUMBER OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE COURT. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU BOTH TO STICK AROUND. WE HAVE MORE TO GET TO. > WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'LL TALK LINDSEY GRAHAM. HE'S TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF A GRAND JURY IN GEORGIA. WHAT WE'RE LEARNING TODAY ABOUT THE FULTON COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S CASE. > PLUS THE BIGGEST JANUARY 6th PROSECUTION TO GO TO TRIAL IS IN THE HANDS OF A WASHINGTON, D.C. JURY.

        "trs": "> JUST DAYS AFTER SECURING THE HOUSE MAJORITY, POTENTIAL SPEAKER KEVIN McCARTHY IS PROMISING TO INVESTIGATE THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE AND KICK LEADING DEMOCRATS OFF OF THEIR COMMITTEE POSTS. AMONG THEM, INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND TRUMP IMPEACHMENT MANAGER ADAM SCHIFF, WHO WAS ASKED ABOUT McCARTHY'S THREAT ON ABC ON SUNDAY.  I SUSPECT HE WILL DO WHATEVER MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE WANTS HIM TO DO. HE WILL ADHERE TO THE WISHES OF THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR. IF THAT PERSON WANTS TO REMOVE PEOPLE, THAT'S WHAT THEY WILL DO. IT'S GOING TO BE CHAOS WITH REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP.  JOINING ME NO -- IT'S BOSTON GLOBE SENIOR OPINION WRITER KIMBERLY ADKINS STORE AND PETER BAKER. FIRST OF ALL, HOW IS THE WHITE HOUSE PREPARING, PETER, FOR THESE INCOMING ATTACKS? WE SHOULD POINT OUT ADAM SCHIFF IS ON THE JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE. HE IS A TRIFECTA OF OPPONENTS OR ADVERSARIES AS FAR AS THE TRUMP TEAM AND KEVIN McCARTHY ARE CONCERNED.  THAT'S RIGHT. THE WHITE HOUSE HAS KNOWN IS WAS COMING. THEY EXPECTED THERE TO BE A MORE ROBUST REPUBLICAN MA JUROR. THEY HAVE BEEN HIRING AND RETHINKING THEIR -- THE COUNSEL'S OFFICE HAS BEEN RETHINKING THEIR STRATEGY FOR A WHILE. WE SAW A REFUSAL TO PARTICIPATE IN CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT WHEN TRUMP WOULD ARGUE, WHY SHOULD I ABIDE BY SUBPOENAS? THE BIDEN PEOPLE WILL THINK THIS IS ALL POLITICAL, TOO. ARE THEY GOING TO ABIDE BY SUBPOENAS AND CITE THE TRUMP PRECEDENT? ARE THEY GOING TO ABIDE BY THEM AS PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS HAVE IN KEEPING WITH TRADITION AND THE NORMS GOING FORWARD? THE REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE HAVE ONLY THEMSELVES TO LOOK AT IF, IN FACT, BIDEN STIFFS THEM. THEY ACCEPTED AND SUPPORTED PRESIDENT TRUMP WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP STIFFED THE DEMOCRATS WHEN THEY WERE IN CHARGE. WE ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT OVERSIGHT WILL LOOK LIKE. IT'S ALWAYS POLITICAL. IT LOOKS EXCEPTIONALLY NOW, PARTICULARLY WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP RUNNING AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN AND SEEMINGLY PULLING THE STRINGS WITH KEVIN McCARTHY. THERE'S A REALLY LARGER QUESTION HERE ABOUT THE SYSTEM AND WHETHER THE SYSTEM WILL BE PERMANENTLY BROKEN OR NOT.  ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE, PETER AND KIM, IS HOW MUCH THIS FREEZES THE WHITE HOUSE? FROM TALKING TO OFFICIALS IN CLINTON AND OBAMA ADMINISTRATIONS, JUNIOR STAFF HAD TO HIRE LAWYERS. NOBODY HELPED THEM PAY FOR THAT. NOTHING ELSE COULD GET DONE IF THEY JUST GET A BLIZZARD OF SUBPOENAS. KIM?  THAT'S RIGHT. IT CAN MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THINGS DONE. IT CAN BE TIME CONSUMING AND EXPENSIVE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE SUBJECT OF SOME OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS. ONE THING I CAN EXPECT THAT HOUSE MEMBERS -- THE HOUSE MAJORITY WOULD DO IS TARGET THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. THEY HAVE SET TO DO THAT. WE HAVE SEEN MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE CALLING TO DE-FUND THE PART OF THE DOJ THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INVESTIGATIONS INTO TRUMP. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE A HEADACHE NOT JUST FOR THE WHITE HOUSE BUT FOR DOJ AND MERRICK GARLAND AS WELL. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE JUST HOW LEADERSHIP HANDLES THESE CALLS TO GO AFTER THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND ANYONE WHO HAS SEEN FIT TO INVESTIGATE DONALD TRUMP, ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE MIDTERM RESULTS. IT WAS NOT AS BIG OF A MAJORITY AS THEY WERE PLANNING ON. WE SAW VOTERS NOT ONLY RESPOND TO ISSUES LIKE INFLATION AND IMMIGRATION BUT REALLY REJECT THIS SORT OF POLITICKING IN POLITICS THAT LED TO THIS IDEA THAT THE DOJ OR OTHERS WERE ACTING IN AN IMPERMISSIBLE WAY AND REALLY SUPPORTING DEMOCRACY. IF THEY GO FULLY ON THAT, IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SEE THAT KEVIN McCARTHY WON'T BE ABLE TO SEE, THIS IS GOING TO BE BAD NEWS FOR US IN 2024 IF WE DON'T TRY TO WORK WITH THE DEMOCRATS TO PASS SOMETHING ON ECONOMIC POLICY, SOMETHING ON IMMIGRATION POLICY, INSTEAD OF JUST BEING ON THE ATTACK OR JUST OBSTRUCTING JOE BIDEN. VOTERS DIDN'T SEEM TO LIKE THAT IN 2022. I CAN'T IMAGINE THEY LIKE IT MORE IN 2024.  PETER, ALSO IN ADDITION TO WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE FROM KEVIN McCARTHY, IN ORDER TO GET TO 218 AND BECOME SPEAKER, HE WILL HAVE TO MAKE A LOT OF DEALS WITH PEOPLE LIKE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. ALSO, YOU HAVE THE 2024 WANNA-BES. MIKE PENCE SAYING LAST SUNDAY TO CHUCK TODD THAT THE SUPREME COURT ABORTION RULING, THE DOBBS RULING WAS THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ACHIEVEMENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION. MIKE POMPEO, THE FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE, WHO KNOWS ABOUT FOREIGN ENEMIES AND ADVERSARIES, DEMONIING THE HEAD OF THE TEACHERS UNION AND CALLING HER THE MOST DANGEROUS PERSON IN THE WORLD. REALLY? MORE DANGEROUS THAN KIM JONG-UN?  YEAH. MIKE POMPEO NEGOTIATED WITH THE TALIBAN THAT BECAME THE BASIS FOR WHAT PRESIDENT BIDEN DID. HE KNOWS ABOUT NEGOTIATING WITH BAD ACTORS. IT DOES SEEM LIKE HE THINK THAT. THERE'S POLITICS GOING ON. POMPEO IS TRYING TO POSITION HIMSELF AS CHAMPION OF CONSERVATIVES IN AN INCREASINGLY CROWDED PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY FIELD. SAME WITH MIKE PENCE. HE WANTS TO OWN THE DOBBS DECISION FOR A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY ELECTORATE. YOU CAN MAKE THE CASE THAT THE TRUMP/PENCE ADMINISTRATION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DOBBS DECISION, HAVING PUT THREE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES ON THE COURT WHO OVERTURNED ROE V. WADE FOR AN ANTI-ABORTION CONSTITUENT CONSTITUENTS. WE HAVE SEEN THERE'S A BACKLASH AMONG SOME VOTERS TO THE OVERTURNING OF ROE V. WADE. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING WHERE MIKE PENCE WOULD HAVE EXPLAINING TO DO IF HE GOT THERE. WE ARE A LONG WAYS AWAY FROM THAT. YOU ARE SEEING EARLY POSITIONING OF THE FIELD WITH ONE LARGE FIGURE STILL LOOMING OVER IT. THAT'S DONALD TRUMP.  INDEED. KIMBERLY AND PETER, THANK YOU. HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES. > AT WHITE HOUSE, DR. FAUCI AND WHAT HE SAYS IS HIS LAST APPEARANCE IN THE BRIEFING ROOM AND THIS JOB AS HE PREPARES TO LEAVE THE ADMINISTRATION IN DECEMBER AFTER SERVING UNDER SEVEN PRESIDENTS, THE HEAD OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, URGING AMERICANS TO GET THEIR COVID BOOSTERS AND THEIR FLU SHOTS.  WHEN I SEE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE DIVISIVENESS IN OUR COUNTRY OF NOT GETTING VACCINATED FOR REASONS THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH PUBLIC HEALTH BUT HAVE TO DO BECAUSE OF DIVISIVENESS AND IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES, AS A PHYSICIAN, IT PAINS ME. BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYBODY GET INFECTED. I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYBODY HOSPITALIZED. I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYBODY DIE FROM COVID. WHETHER YOU ARE A FAR RIGHT REPUBLICAN OR A FAR LEFT DEMOCRAT, IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE TO ME.  THAT'S BECAUSE HE IS A DOCTOR. HE IS A SCIENTIST. DR. FAUCI HAS DEDICATED MORE THAN 50 YEARS OF HIS LIFE TO GOVERNMENT SERVICE FROM THE FIGHT AGAINST HIV TO, OF COURSE, THE COVID PANDEMIC. > NEXT, WORLD CUP CONTROVERSY.

        "trs": "> I AM NOT A ROLE MODEL. I'M NOT PAID TO BE A ROLE MODEL. I AM PAID TO WREAK HAVOC ON THE BASKETBALL COURT. PARENTS SHOULD BE ROLE MODELS. JUST BECAUSE I DUNK A BASKETBALL DOESN'T MEAN I SHOULD RAISE YOUR KIDS.  THAT WAS HALL OF FAMER CHARLES BARKLEY IN 1993. HE WROTE THAT SCRIPT HIMSELF. HE PLAYED FOR 16 SEASONS IN THE NBA 1984 TO 2000. HE WAS A SMALL POWER FORWARD HEIGHT WISE. BUT THE 1993 MVP AND 11-TIME ALL-TIME KNOWN AS MUCH MORE THAN AN ATHLETE. JOINING US NOW TIMOTHY BELLA WITH \"BARKLEY: THE BIOGRAPHY.\" YOU WRITE CHARLES WADE BARKLEY IS AS TRANSCENDENT AS HE IS IRREVERENT. HIS BASKETBALL LEGACY IS AS CLOSE AS SOMEONE WITHOUT A CHAMPIONSHIP RING CAN GET TO BEING UNASSAILABLE. HE CHANGED HOW FANS WATCHED THE GAME. HE DOESN'T LIKE TO BE CALLED CONTROVERSIAL. TO MANY HE RESURRECTED WHAT IT MIGHT TO BE THE VOICE OF THE AMERICAN ATHLETE NOT SEEN FOR DECADES IN A WORLD HE CONSIDERED TOO POLITICALLY CORRECT, GUARDED AND COMFORTABLE. I THINK THERE'S A GENERATION OF PEOPLE WHO KNOW HIM AS THE GUY ON TNT THAT WITH THE REST OF THE GUYS THERE WITH KENNY AND ERNIE REVOLUTIONIZED ANALYSIS OF SPORTS BY TELLING IT LIKE IT IS. MAN, HE WAS A TRANSCENDENT BASKETBALL PLAYER. DOMINANT AT THE POSITION.  IT'S TRUE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME. HE REALLY WAS THIS GUY WHO WHEN I WAS GROWING UP I SAW HIM. I WAS A SHORT, FAT KID WHO LOVED PLAYING BASKETBALL. I'M LIKE HOW DOES HE DO THAT? FROM THERE I SAW THIS GUY WHO JUST GRABBED HIS REBOUNDS AND JUST GO COAST TO COAST AND JUST SLAM DUNK AND HANG ON THE RIM LIKE HE'S THE INCREDIBLE HULK ON A SWING SET AND JUST BLOWN AWAY BY THIS MAN. SO PART OF THIS BOOK IS JUST REMINDING PEOPLE TO ONLY SEE HIM ON TNT THAT HE WAS A PROBLEM BACK THEN, A REALLY SPECIAL PLAYER.  IT IS SO INTERESTING. YOU TALK TO NBA FANS NOW AND THEY LOOK BACK TO PLAYERS IN WHAT I CONSIDER THE GOLDEN ERA IN THE '80s AND '90s AND THEY GO LARRY BIRD CAN NEVER PLAY WITH THIS PERSON WHY THE GREAT E PLAYERS ARE LIKE ARE YOU KIDDING? HE WOULD BE MY FIRST PICK WITH MAGIC. CHARLES BARKLEY FILLS OUT THAT ROLE. I LOVE THIS CHUCK D. QUOTE. THESE NEW GENERATIONS DON'T UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEY CAN'T BELIEVE IT BUT CHARLES BARKLEY WAS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. HE WAS ON THE COURT, MAN. IF YOU WERE GOING UP AGAINST HIM OR PEOPLE LIKE BIRD, THOSE PEOPLE WERE NOT NONSTOP PROBLEMS. 24 HOURS A DAY.  YEAH. IN THE CASE OF DR. J, WHEN HE PRACTICED WITH CHARLES FOR THE FIRST TIME HE KNOCKED INTO HIM AND HE GOT KNOCKED INTO THE STANDS AND AFTER THAT DR. J TOLD ME HE STAYED OUT OF CHARLES' WAY BECAUSE HE WAS SO PHYSICAL, NO FORCEFUL. HE PLAYED WITH SO MUCH ENERGY, PASSION THAT YOU JUST COULD NOT CONTAIN HIM. IT REALLY RESONATED WITH SO MANY PEOPLE FOR SO LONG.  YOU KNOW, TIM, THE AD WE CAME IN, THE OLD 1993 NIKE AD, I AM NOT A ROLE MODEL. YOU SHOULD RAISE YOUR CHILDREN. PEOPLE TODAY, MOST PEOPLE TODAY WOULD ASSUME, KNOW HIM FROM TV. HEARING THE ANALYSIS AS WILLIE POINTED OUT WITH ERNIE. CHARLES BARKLEY'S GIFT IS IT NOT TO PRESENT THAT HE'S SEARINGLY HONEST?  HE IS. I DO THINK THAT IT IS HIS BLESSING OF BARKLEY IN A LOT OF WAYS THAT HE IS HONEST AND THAT SOMETIMES MEANS HE IS GOING TO SCREW UP AND I DO THINK THAT HIS KIND OF THE BEAUTY OF WHO HE IS, HE IS GOING TO SAY THINGS THAT SOME PEOPLE AGREE WITH. OTHERS WILL HATE AND CALL JUST INAPPROPRIATE BUT HE IS ALWAYS HIMSELF WHETHER IT BE SPEAKING TO REPORTERS OR ON TNT EACH WEEK. EVEN WHEN HE IS CALLED TO APOLOGIZE SOMETIMES HE JUST WON'T. BUT IN A LOT OF WAYS HE IS THIS UNCLE THAT AMERICA KEEPS COMING BACK TO. IN A LOT OF WAYS HE IS TEFLON.  YEAH. SEEMS LIKE HE WAS ALSO AHEAD OF HIS TIME THAT BARKLEY WAS THIS UNFILTERED VOICE ALMOST FORESHADOWING WHAT ATHLETES COULD DO NOW. BE OUTSPOKEN AND TURNED THAT INTO A SUCCESSFUL TV BROADCAST. AS A FINAL QUESTION, AS YOU REPORTED OUT THIS BOOK WHAT DO PLAYERS IN THE NBA THINK OF HIM NOW? THERE'S A MIST, LARRY BIRD NOT ATHLETIC AND NBA HANDS KNOW HE IS GREAT. WHAT BARKLEY LACKED IN HEIGHT HE MADE UP FOR IN WILL.  IT'S REAL SPLIT. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO HEAR WHAT SHAQ AND KENNY SAY AND TAKE IT AS TOTAL GOSPEL AND THEN OTHER GUYS LIKE KEVIN DURANT PUBLICLY GOING BACK AND FORTH WITH CHUCK ABOUT SOME COMMENTS OF BEING A BUS RIDER INSTEAD OF A BUS DRIVER. THERE REALLY IS THIS SPLIT AMONGST HIS CURRENT GENERATION OF PLAYERS TOWARD CHARLES BARKLEY BUT I THINK THE RESPECT IS ALWAYS THERE. CHARLES NOW IS IN BROADCASTING LONGER THAN HE WAS A PLAYER. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT NO ONE COULD HAVE POSSIBLY ANTICIPATED BUT HE IS BETTER AT THIS AND THAT THERE IS THAT DIVIDE THERE BUT THERE IS A REALLY HEALTHY AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR WHAT HE'S DONE AND WHAT HE STILL SAYS.  YOU ARE RIGHT. STILL SAYING. IN A WORLD TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT TO SAY THINGS IN PUBLIC KYRIE IRVING, THE NBA QUIET. THE PLAYERS WAS. BARKLEY SAID ON TV, QUOTE, HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED. THEY MADE A MISTAKE. I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IDIOT. END QUOTE. \"THE WASHINGTON POST\" TIMOTHY BELLA, CONGRATULATIONS ON THE BOOK. IT LOOKS GREAT. THANK YOU.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, GUYS. APPRECIATE IT. > JUST PAST THE TOP OF THE HOUR ON THIS TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 22. JONATHAN, MIKE, CLAIRE ALL STILL WITH US. JOINING THE DISCUSSION IS STAFF WRITER AT \"THE ATLANTIC\" DAVID FROMM AND DAVID FRENCH. GOOD MORNING TO YOU BOTH. DAVID FROMM WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE NEW PIECE TITLED ANOTHER FLOP FROM GOP PRODUCTIONS WRITING THIS. THE COMING HOUSE HEARINGS ON BIDEN WILL BE A REPEAT DOSE OF WHITE WATER DELUSION. WILL NOT IMPRESS VOTERS. THERE ARE REAL QUESTIONS TO INVESTIGATE IN THE COMING SESSION OF CONGRESS. WHY WAS THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION CAUGHT SO BY SURPRISE AT THE COLLAPSE OF THE AFGHAN GOVERNMENT? WHAT CAN ACTUALLY BE DETERMINED ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC? BUT ALL THE QUESTIONS LEAD TO ISSUES OF POLICY AND POLICY IS TANGLED, COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT WHY WHAT REPUBLICANS WANT IS AN EXCUSE FOR THE ENABLING OF TRUMP. THEY YEARN TO SPREAD THE FANTASY NARRATIVE THAT BIDEN'S ATTEMPTS ARE TRUMP FAMILY'S LOOTING OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. FANTASIES DO NOT SURVIVE CONTACT WITH THE REALITY. JOE?  YEAH. DAVID, HOW MANY TIMES DO THEY HAVE TO LEARN THIS? WE HEARD ABOUT THE DURHAM INVESTIGATION AND GOING TO EXPOSE THE DEEP STATE. DURHAM MADE A FOOL OF HIMSELF TIME AND TIME AGAIN. A LOT OF MEDIA OUTLETS THAT I RESPECT ON THE RIGHT MADE FOOL OF THEMSELVES TIME AND TIME AGAIN TALKING ABOUT DURHAM AND WHAT HE WAS GOING TO UNCOVER. THE ELECTION DENIERS TALKING ABOUT CHARLES BARKLEY. EVERY ONE OF THEM DUNKED ON LIKE CHARLES BARKLEY. IT IS A BUBBLE YOU TALKED ABOUT AND YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT WHEN I MET YOU IN WASHINGTON, D.C. THAT TIME 1994. '95 AND '96 WE WERE IN A BUBBLE. RIGHT? I RAN. I WAS SUPPOSED TO LOSE. I GET 62%. I GO TO WASHINGTON. ABOUT 50 OR 60 MEN AND WOMEN JUST LIKE ME. WE ARE IN THIS BUBBLE AND CONSTANTLY SELF REINFORCING. WE TURN AROUND AND BILL CLINTON AT 60% AND REPUBLICANS ARE HAMMERED IN '96 AND '98. WE NEVER REALLY LEARNED THE LESSON. THAT'S HAPPENING HERE WITH THESE REPUBLICANS AND ASTOUNDING TO WATCH FROM OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE. BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS SO DISCONNECTED FROM WHAT VOTERS JUST TOLD THEM A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.  HERE'S A WAY TO MEASURE THAT. SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR THE HOUSE CHANGED HANDS FOUR TIMES. 1994, 2004, 2006, 2016, 2018. TWO TIMES TO REPUBLICANS. TWO TIMES TO DEMOCRATS. THE TWO TIMES FLIPPING TO THE DEMOCRATS, THE DEMOCRATS WON THE PRESIDENCY TWO YEARS LATER. TWO TIMES IT FLIPPED TO THE REPUBLICANS, THEY LOST THE PRESIDENCY TWO YEARS LATER. WHY? MANY EXPLANATIONS, OF COURSE. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT IS DEMOCRATS USED THE SEIZURE OF THE HOUSE TO SET THEMSELVES UP FOR THE GENERAL ELECTION TO FOLLOW. REPUBLICANS IN 1994 AND 2010 TALKED TO THEMSELVES. IT MAKES ME THINK OF A FAVORITE SAYING OF POLITICS. SHE TELLS THE STORY ABOUT BEING ON A BEACH IN TEXAS SEEING A PLANE PULLING A SLOGAN AND SAID SOMETHING LIKE, JILL, COME BACK. JACK. TOO MUCH ABOUT YOU AND NOT ENOUGH ABOUT HER. THAT IS WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WILL GO ON AGAIN. TOO MUCH ABOUT YOU. NOT ENOUGH ABOUT HER. THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO COMMIT TO THE FANTASY NARRATIVE ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN. SAD THINGS BUT NOT POLITICALLY INTERESTING AND POLITICALLY INTERESTING THINGS THAT REPUBLICANS CAN SAY ABOUT BIDEN BUT THEY'RE NOT TRUE.  YEAH. REPUBLICANS RAN SAYING JOE BIDEN DIDN'T HAVE AN ANSWER ON INFLATION. THEY RAN SAYING HE DIDN'T HAVE AN ANSWER ON CRIME. HE DIDN'T HAVE AN ANSWER ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER. OKAY, GREAT. BY THE WAY, YOU ARE EXACTLY RIGHT. HAVE THAT INVESTIGATION INTO AFGHANISTAN. HOW DID THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY GET IT SO WRONG? HOW DID AFGHANISTAN FORCES COLLAPSE OVERNIGHT? I WANT TO KNOW THAT. I WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT COVID. HOW WAS THAT BOTCHED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING? HOW WAS THE COMMUNICATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT BOTCHED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AS BADLY AS IT WAS? AND IT WAS. YEAH. YOU ARE RIGHT. THE SOUTHERN BORDER. INVESTIGATE. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ABSOLUTE CHAOS AND THE HUMANITARIAN CRISIS ON THE SOUTHERN BORDER. DAVID FRENCH, WE ARE NOT HEARING ANYTHING ABOUT THAT. WE ARE NOT HEARING ABOUT A HEALTH CARE PLAN TO REPLACE AND REPAIR AND REPLACE OBAMACARE WHICH THEY PROMISED FOR A DOZEN YEARS. HUNTER BIDEN. LIKE I CAN TELL NOW HOW THE STORY ENDS FOR THEM. VERY BADLY. I HAVE BEEN THERE. IT ENDS BADLY.  WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN MANY WAYS IS A POST POLICY GOP. THIS IS A PARTY WITH NO PLATFORM IN 2020 SO AS DAVID SAID EARLIER TALKING ABOUT POLICY IT IS TANGLED AND COMPLICATED. WHAT ARE THE SOLUTIONS? THE HUNTER BIDEN THING IS DEEPLY CONNECTED TO ANGER OVER 2020. IT IS VERY CONNECTED TO ANGER OVER TWITTER SUPPRESSING NEWS OF HUNTER BIDEN. THERE'S A SENSE THAT THIS IS THE TIME TO GET REVENGE. YOU CAN'T IGNORE HIM NOW BECAUSE WE ARE IN CHARGE. BUT NOBODY OUTSIDE OF THE VERY ONLINE SPACES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS CONCERNED ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN. THEY DIDN'T VOTE FOR HIM. THEY KNOW HE HAS NO AUTHORITY IN GOVERNMENT. SO THE GOP WILL HAVE TO REDISCOVER POLICY AND BREAK FROM THE HOLD, THE VERY ONLINE WORLD HAS ON IT. THAT VERY ONLINE WORLD TRANCE LATES INTO FOX PRIME TIME AND THIS CLOSED COMMUNITY OF CONSERVATIVE INFO-TAINMENT THAT DRIVES THE GOP BUT THERE'S STOCK TAKING GOING ON. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MORE OPEN TO QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COURSE OF THE PARTY THAN I SAW AFTER 2020. IT IS CONNECTED TO THAT ANGER OVER THE 2020 ELECTION.  IN THAT PARTICULAR --  WE HAVE SEEN THIS STORY BEFORE. TEN YEARS AGO 2012. MITT ROMNEY WATCHED FOX NEW THAT IS TOLD HIM HE WAS TO WIN. THE GALLUP POLLS SAID HE WAS GOING TO WIN. RIGHT WING MEDIA TOLD HIM HE WAS GOING TO WIN. ONLINE. THAT'S WHY HALFWAY THROUGH THE NIGHT THE ROMNEYS WERE ABSOLUTELY STUNNED TO DISCOVER WHAT THE REST OF US KNEW. I HAVE KNOWN MITT FOR A LONG TIME. I LOVE HIM AND ANN AND THE FAMILY. DURING THE RACE, HE STOPPED COMING ON OUR SHOW AND HE STOPPED COMING ON OUR SHOW NOT BECAUSE I WAS TOUGHER ON HIM THAN ANYBODY ELSE BUT THAT WAS OUTSIDE THE BUBBLE. THIS IS WHAT REPUBLICANS DID IN '12. IT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.  YOU VERY KINDLY ON THE THURSDAY AFTER THAT TUESDAY VOTE HAD ME ON THE SHOW TO PROMOTE A BOOK I WROTE CALLED \"WHY ROMNEY LOST.\" NOW I WRITE FAST BUT I DON'T WRITE THAT FAST. I HAD SPENT THREE MONTHS WRITING A BOOK CALLED \"WHY ROMNEY LOST.\" IT WAS OBVIOUS TO ME WHY HE LOST. THE BOOK BECAME SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE OF YOU. HOW COME I SAW IT AND THE ROMNEY CAMPAIGN DID NOT?  I REMEMBER IN THE SUMMER THE WORSE BARRAGE I HAVE EVER GOTTEN ON TWITTER SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT ROMNEY'S CAMPAIGN NOT GOING WELL AND I WAS A COMI. I THINK AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER. IT WAS SO INTELLIGENCE. I WAS SHOCKED BECAUSE WHAT I WAS SAYING IS IN EARLY SEPTEMBER THE CAMPAIGN IS IN TROUBLE AND BLASTED BY PEOPLE ON FOX NEWS PRIME TIME CALLING ME ALL KINDS OF STUFF. I WAS REPORTING. I LOVE ROMNEY. BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HEAR IT. AGAIN, IT IS THIS BUBBLE. JONATHAN, YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS NOW. NOT THE SENATE REPUBLICANS. THERE ARE A LOT OF SENATE REPUBLICANS THAT ARE ALREADY SENDING UP WARNING SIGNALS SAYING TO THE HOUSE BROTHERS AND SISTERS, YOU GUY NEED TO CUT THIS OUT BUT YOU LOOK AT THE BUBBLE AND BOTH THE DAVIDS ARE TALKING ABOUT IT SO WELL. THESE PEOPLE LIVE IN A BUBBLE OF ELECTION DENIERS. ENDS UP THAT DOESN'T RATE SO WELL. THAT DOESN'T FILL THE SEATS IN THE THEATER. YOU LOSE IF YOU'RE AN ELECTION DENIER. IN THE BUBBLE THAT'S ALL YOU HEARD SINCE 2020. HUNTER BIDEN SINCE 2020. THEY'RE ANGRY. YES, WHY DON'T WE FIGURE OUT WHY WOULDN'T TWITTER ALLOW A \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" ARTICLE ABOUT THE LAP TOP TO GO ON THERE? HAVE THAT INVESTIGATION. TALK ABOUT HOW SOME THINGS WENT DOWN THE WAY THEY DID IN 2020 BUT FOR THAT TO BE THE SINGULAR FOCUS WHEN AMERICANS ARE STILL CONCERNED AFTER THE ELECTION ABOUT INFLATION, QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES, CRIME, ABOUT THE SOUTHERN BORDER. TALK ABOUT THEM! THAT'S THE STRENGTHS BUT THEY WON'T DO IT.  YEAH. THERE'S PRESSURE NOW OF THE REPUBLICANS TO DO SO BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTROL THE HOUSE BY A FEW SEATS TO BE SURE BUT THEY ARE IN CHARGE. A LOT OF PEOPLE I SPEAK TO IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE DEMOCRATS FEEL LIKE THIS IS LITIGATED BEFORE. DONALD TRUMP TRIED TO INJECT HUNTER BIDEN INTO THE 2020 ELECTION. HE TRIED TO --  JONATHAN, REALLY QUICKLY, THERE WERE ACTUALLY IN THAT DEBATE WHEN HE STARTED TO TALK ABOUT BIDEN, THERE WERE SOME FIRE BREATHING CONSERVATIVES THAT WROTE ENTIRE COLUMNS ABOUT HOW THEY WERE OFFENDED THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS ATTACKING A SON WHO HAD SOME SERIOUS, SERIOUS PROBLEMS. AND IT HAD SERIOUS PROBLEMS HIS ENTIRE LIFE. THIS IS JUST BUILT TO BACKFIRE. I'M NOT DOING THIS TO PROTECT HUNTER BIDEN BUT TO TELL THE REPUBLICANS PLAY TO THE STRENGTHS. HE IS NOT THE STRENGTH.  YEAH. THEY TRY TO MAKE HAY A FEW WEEKS AGO ABOUT THIS NEWLY UNCOVERED VOICEMAIL OF JOE BIDEN BUT IT WAS THE FATHER IN PAIN WORRIED ABOUT THE TROUBLED SON AND DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SOMETHING -- THIS IS PLAYING TO A SMALL AUDIENCE. CERTAIN FOX NEWS PRIME TIME HOSTS AND THAT'S ABOUT IT AND SEEMS THAT AMERICANS DON'T CARE. CLAIRE, HOW'S THIS GOING TO PLAY OUT? REPUBLICANS ARE SPENDING EARLY CAPITAL ON THIS. WAVING POSTERS AND SAYING THERE WILL BE INVESTIGATIONS AND START A PROCESS THAT COULD LEAD TO THE IMPEACHMENT OF JOE BIDEN. HOW DO YOU THINK IT WILL BACKFIRE?  YOU WILL HAVE IF McCARTHY MAKES IT ONE OF THE WEAKEST SPEAKERS IN OUR LIFETIME BECAUSE FIRST HE WENT AND GROVELING WITH TRURN AND NOW MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. HE IS GIVING HER WHAT HE IS ASKING FOR TO GET THE TITLE SPEAKER. THAT'S NOT GOING TO END WELL FOR HIM AND THE REPUBLICANS. ONE THING I THINK WE HAVEN'T YET REALLY HIT ON HARD AND THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING ON TRIAL IS ADDICTION. ADDICTION IS A PAINFUL THING IN MOTOR VEHICLE. THERE IS NOT A FAMILY IN AMERICA THAT IS NOT IMPACTED BY ADDICTION. AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEONE IS ADDICTED. AND THE PAIN AROUND THAT. SO WHEN THEY DO THESE SHOW TRIALS ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN WHAT A LOT OF MOTHERS AND FATHERS WILL BE SEEING IS SEEING THE LOVED ONE ON TRIAL FOR ADDICTION AND THAT I THINK WILL BE MORE POWERFUL TO TURN PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAN ANYTHING ELSE THEY CAN DO.  YEAH. DAVID FRENCH, YOU HAVE WRITTEN A NEW OP-ED IN \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" AND YOU TALKED ABOUT THE BARGAIN THAT THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT MADE WITH DONALD TRUMP AND PAID DEARLY FOR THAT BARGAIN. OF COURSE, ABORTION BECOMING A KEY ISSUE IN THIS MIDTERM IN A WAY THAT THE PRO LIFE COMMUNITY NEVER IMAGINED. TALK ABOUT IT AND ALSO -- WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT OUR CHURCH. EVANGELICAL MOVEMENT. HAD ANDY STANLEY TALKING ON TALKING ABOUT HOW DEPRESSED HE WAS ON DIVIDING THE CHURCH ON WEARING MASKS AND BASIC SCIENCE. SEEN DAN DARLING FIRED FOR TALKING ABOUT BASIC SCIENCE. I'M STARTING TO HEAR FROM EVANGELICAL LEADERS THAT THEY REGRET MAKING THE DEAL WITH TRUMP. WE COULDN'T SAY ANYTHING. YOU COULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING. I'M WONDERING. OBVIOUSLY TRUMP'S DESTROYED THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OF MY YOUTH AND PUT A PRETTY GOOD DENT IN THE EVANGELICAL CHURCH. AM I MISTAKEN OR DOES THERE SEEM TO BE SOME SELF CORRECTION, SOME UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS GUY AS I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR SIX YEARS IS ANTITHESIS OF EVERYTHING THAT JESUS CHRIST SAID IN THE NEW TESTAMENT?  YEAH. THERE IS A REAPPRAISAL GOING ON. SADLY IT IS TIED TO ELECTORAL OUTCOMES THAN MORALITY. I'M SEEING IT ON THE GROUND. I LIVE IN A TRUMP CENTERED PART OF THE COUNTRY BUT THE 2022 ELECTION IS MAKING THEM RETHINK 2020 AND 2018. 2018 THEY WROTE OFF STANDARD MIDTERM LOSSES. NOW THEY KNOW IT'S NOT SO STANDARD. 2020 WROTE OFF WITH THE HAZE WITH STOP THE STEAL. 2022 WITH INFLATION AND CRIME HIGHER THEY COULDN'T WRITE OFF AT ALL ANY WAY, SHAPE OR FORM AND WHAT IT DID FOR PEOPLE IS RETHINK 2020 AND 2018. AND MADE THEM SAY TO THEMSELVES THIS GUY IS NOT IN FACT THE MODEL FOR THE FUTURE. THIS GUY IS NOT A RELENTLESS WINNER. I WISH THE REPRAISALS OCCURRED EARLIER. AT LEAST JANUARY 6, 2021, SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE REAPPRAISAL. WE NEED TO HAVE ONE AND GLAD IT'S HAPPENING NOW AND RELATED TO MORE THAN JUST MIDTERMS AND THE ARTICLE UP THERE IS A LEADER TALKING TO VERY TRUMPY REPUBLICANS AND SAID SOME HARD TRUTHS TO THEM AND RELATES HOW THE ROOM GOT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. SOMETHING IS BREAKING RIGHT NOW. WE DON'T ALWAYS HAVE FEVERS BREAK FOR THE REASON WE WANT THEM TO BREAK. RIGHT? BUT WHEN A FEVER BREAKS IT'S POSITIVE RESULTS. AND I THINK WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THE POSITIVE RESULTS NOW.  I'M A BAPTIST. WE ARE IN THE CONVERSION BUSINESS. DOESN'T MATTER. WE ARE PLAYING \"JUST AS I AM\" ALL 16 VERSES. LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THIS. AND THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE TO TALK ABOUT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S CONCERNED ME SO MUCH ABOUT ABORTION IN CONSERVATIVE POLITICS AND EVANGELICAL POLITICS IS AS I HAVE SAID ON THIS SHOW THE SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH IS PRO CHOICE BASICALLY. THROUGHOUT THE 1970s. THEY PASSED TWO DECLARATIONS. ONE IN '70 AND ONE IN '74. THAT CHANGED. THEY BECAME PRO LIFE. I THINK MY FRIEND RUSSELL MOORE IN 2003 PUT SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR OF THE SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONVENTION THAT CHANGED IT. DOESN'T GO BACK I BELIEVE TO THE BIBLE, TO JESUS' TEACHING THOUGH I UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE WOULD BE PRO LIFE. I ONLY BRING THAT UP TO SAY I'VE ALWAYS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE COMING FORWARD LIKE DONALD TRUMP AND SEEN IT THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE. THE WORST HUMAN BEINGS ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH, PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT CONSERVATIVE ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS WAVE THE BLOODY BANNER OF ABORTION AND PEOPLE AND CHURCHES FALL. HE IS A MAN OF GOD. AND TRUMP PLAYED THEM LIKE A FIDDLE. HERE'S A GUY PRO CHOICE LIKE ALL THE WAY. BUT WHEN HE DECIDED TO RUN HE IS LIKE WAIT A SECOND. THE MORE PRO LIFE I SOUND THE EVANGELICALS THROW IN WITH ME. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THINGS ARE CHANGING NOW. ARE WE GOING TO SEE THE SAME THING FIVE AND TEN YEARS FROM NOW. WILL EVANGELICALS BE A BIT WISER IN FOLLOWING THE FALSE IDOLS?  ONE, I HOPE SO. I DON'T KNOW. HERE'S SOME REASON FOR HOPE ON THAT POINT. FOR A LONG TIME THE PRO LIFE MOVEMENT WAS FOCUSED ON THE NINE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES. BECAUSE OF THE ROE DECISION WHICH I PROFOUNDLY DISAGREED WITH. IT WAS LIMITED IN ITS ABILITY TO PROTECT UNBORN LIFE. NOW AMERICAN LAW CAN PROTECT UNBORN LIFE. THE SECOND PART OF THE CHALLENGE KICKS IN WHICH IS THERE'S TO A PRO LIFER CULTURE IN THE UNITED STATES WITHOUT PERSUADING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO CHANGE THE MINDS ABOUT THIS ISSUE. AND ONE THING FROM A PRO LIFE PERSPECTIVE FOR ME THAT'S SO DISCOURAGING IS OF 27% OF AMERICANS, SECOND HIGHEST PRIORITY WITH ABORTION FRONT OF MIND 76% VOTED AGAINST THE PRO-LIFE POSITION. SO THAT MEANT AND WHAT THAT TOLD ME IS THERE'S MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF HEARTS AND MINDS HAVE TO BE CHANGED AND THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THAT THROUGH ANIMOSITY AND VENGEANCE. SO THAT'S WHY I WROTE WHAT I WROTE AND CALLED PEOPLE BACK TO JOHN PAUL II'S BOOK AND IN 1995 ABOUT A PRO-LIFE THEOLOGY USES THIS PHRASE. THE VALUE OF THE HUMAN PERSON. THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORTH OF THE HUMAN PERSON FROM CONCEPTION UNTIL NATURAL DEATH AND A MOVEMENT OF ANIMOSITY AND VENGEANCE DOESN'T DO THAT. THAT COURSE HAS TO CHANGE.  DAVID FROMM, FINAL THOUGHT ON THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS AND WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE OR ARE NOT LEARNING FROM IT?  I SET IT UP IN THE ARTICLE AS A PLAY. I TOOK YOU BACK IN TIME TO THE 1990s WHERE THE REPUBLICANS SAID DO YOU KNOW THAT BILL CLINTON IS AN UNFAITHFUL HUSBAND? YEAH. DO YOU CARE? NO. THE REPUBLICANS SAID, WHAT IF WE TOLD YOU THAT THEY WERE THE MASTER MINDS OF A GLOBAL CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY WITH DRUG SMUGGLING? THE VOTERS SAID WE WOULD SAY YOU'RE DELUSION MANIACS. THAT IS GOING ON NOW TODAY WITH HUNTER BIDEN. WHAT IF WE TOLD YOU HE'S A MESS? THAT IS TRUE. DO YOU CARE? NO. WHAT IF HE'S THE MASTER MIND OF AN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY? THE ANSWER IS GOING TO BE THE SAME.  DAVID FROMM, DAVID FRENCH, CLAIRE McCASKILL, THANK YOU. > MIKE POMPEO'S STANLTS ABOUT WHO HE CONSIDERS THE MOST DANGEROUS PERSON IN THE WORLD. > PLUS DONALD TRUMP THREATENED A THIRD PARTY RUN SEVERAL TIMES IN THE PAST. WILL HE DO IT? WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT COULD MEAN FOR THE PARTY AND THE RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU'RE WATCHING \"MORNING JOE.\"  I REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT LOOKING AT ME AND HE POINTED OUT THE WINDOW AT THE CROWD GATHERING. HE SAID DID YOU SEE THAT CROWD OUT THERE? I SAID, I DID, MR. PRESIDENT. HE SAID, THOSE PEOPLE LOVE US. I SAID, THOSE PEOPLE LOVE YOU. HE SAID, WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE.  THE SADDEST BOOK TOUR OF ALL TIME. 20221122132720.067|20221122133127.080",

        "trs": " IN THE WINNERS CIRCLE TONIGHT, THE GOVERNOR ELECT WHO SAVED DEMOCRACY AND SAVED THE INTEGRITY OF THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN ARIZONA.  THIS ELECTION, ARIZONANS CHOSE SOLVING OUR PROBLEMS OVER CONSPIRACY THEORIES. WE CHOSE A BETTER ARIZONA, AND WE CHOSE DEMOCRACY. THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT THAT MADE AMERICA THE BEST AND MOST PROSPEROUS COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. WITH THE ATTACKS ON DEMOCRACY WON'T AND TODAY WITH THIS VICTORY. SO, IT IS ON ALL OF US TO CONTINUE TO DEFEND IT.  IT HAS BEEN EXACTLY ONE WEEK SINCE NBC NEWS CALLED THE ARIZONA GOVERNOR'S ELECTION FOR DEMOCRAT KATIE HOBBS. SHE DEFEATED TRUMP'S CHOSEN CANDIDATE ELECTION LIAR, KARI LAKE, BY MORE THAN 70,000 VOTES. KARI LAKE IS, OF COURSE, REFUSING TO ADMIT SHE LOST. KARA LIKE AN DONALD TRUMP SUGGESTED A PRINTER ISSUE IN MARICOPA COUNTY, SLOWED THE TABULATION OF SOME BALLOTS AND BRIEFLY LEAD TO LONG LINES AT SOME POLLING PRECINCTS, DISENFRANCHISED AND DISPROPORTIONATELY EFFECTED REPUBLICAN AREAS OF THE COUNTY. BILL GATES, THE REPUBLICAN CHAIR OF THE MARICOPA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, SAYS THE PRINTER ISSUE HAD NO EFFECT.  WE'VE REVIEWED THIS ISSUE. WE FOUND THAT THE 70 VOTE CENTERS THAT WERE IMPACTED BY THE PRINTER ISSUES WERE SPREAD ALL ACROSS MARICOPA COUNTY, AND THEY DID NOT IMPACT ONE PART OF THE VALLEY MORE THAN THE OTHER.  MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE CONFIRMED TODAY THAT BILL GATES HAS BEEN MOVED TO AN UNDISCLOSED LOCATION FOR HIS SAFETY, AND IS BEING ACCOMPANIED BY A SECURITY DETAIL FOLLOWING THREATS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THE MARICOPA COUNTY SHERIFF WAS ASKED ABOUT THESE THREATS TODAY.  AS THE INTENSITY EFFORTS RIGHT NOW AFTER THIS ELECTION MORE INTENSE, LESS INTENSE ABOUT THE SAME AS IT WAS IN 2020?  THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. I JUST THINK THAT THERE HAS BEEN A NATURAL ESCALATION BECAUSE THE FOLKS FEEL EMBOLDENED, AND THEY HAVE PEOPLE IN OFFICE, OR RUNNING FOR OFFICE WHO ARE EMPOWERING THEM, AND IT NEEDS TO STOP.  AND JOINING US NOW, ARIZONA SECRETARY OF STATE, KATIE HOBBS, WHO, IN JANUARY, WE'LL TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE AS ARIZONA'S 24TH GOVERNOR. GOVERNOR ELECT HOBBS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. IT IS GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK WITH US, AS A WINNER. I WANT TO SPEND A MOMENT ON THE CAMPAIGN BECAUSE I KNOW, BECAUSE HE REFUSED TO DEBATE KARI LAKE, THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WANTED YOU TO WIN, WHO THOUGHT YOU MADE A MISTAKE, YOU THOUGHT YOUR CAMPAIGN WAS MAKING MISTAKES, AND THAT YOU ARE CAMPAIGNING IN EFFECTIVELY, AND THEY WERE PREPARING THEMSELVES FOR KARI LAKE WINNING BECAUSE OF THAT. WHAT WAS YOUR CONFERENCE LEVEL IN THOSE DECISIONS AS YOU MADE THEM, INCLUDING THE DECISION NOT TO ENGAGE IN A DEBATE WITH HER?  I KNEW WE WERE RUNNING A SOLID CAMPAIGN, A CAMPAIGN THAT WAS DOING ALL THE THINGS THAT WE NEEDED TO DO, AND THAT THE FOLKS CRITICIZING WEREN'T LOOKING AT THE SAME DATA WE WERE LOOKING AT. AT THE END OF THE DAY, I AM HERE AS THE GOVERNOR ELECT, AND WE RAN A GOOD CAMPAIGN.  DO YOU AGREE WITH THE SHERIFF'S ASSESSMENT, THAT THE THREATS TO PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND OTHERS ARE WORSE THIS TIME, THEN THEY WERE TWO YEARS AGO, ON THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION?  I CERTAINLY HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME LEVEL OF THREAT THAT I WAS UNDER IN 2020. IT IS, IT'S PROBABLY ESCALATED. YOU HAVE FOLKS LIKE MY OPPONENT KARI LAKE, PUBLICANS UP AND DOWN THE TICKET WHO ARE REFUSING TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS, CALLING FOR A REDO OF THE ELECTION. SO, OF COURSE, WHAT ARE THEIR FOLLOWERS GOING TO DO? WE THINK THIS ELECTION WAS LED TO BELIEVE THE 2020 ELECTION WAS STOLEN. IT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE. THEY ARE BEING EGGED ON BY THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS, UNFORTUNATELY.  DO YOU THINK IT'S ACCURATE TO SAY, AS I HAVE, THAT DEMOCRACY WAS ON THE BALLOT, IN ARIZONA, BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE KARI LAKE AND OTHERS, THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE, WE'RE VIRTUALLY PLEDGED TO DELIVER THE ARIZONA'S ELECTORAL VOTES TO DONALD TRUMP, OR WHOEVER THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WAS, NO MATTER HOW MANY VOTES THE DEMOCRAT GOT?  ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN, IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT GAVE HIS FULL-THROATED ENDORSEMENT TO THIS ENTIRE SLATE OF CANDIDATES HERE IN ARIZONA, BECAUSE THEY PLEDGED THEIR LOYALTY TO HIM VERSUS THE VOTERS OF ARIZONA THAT WERE RUNNING TO REPRESENT. THEY MADE IT CLEAR IN THEIR ACTIONS SINCE THIS ELECTION, REFUSING TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS, THAT THEY WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING IF THEY WERE IN THESE OFFICES OF POWER IN THE 2024 ELECTION.  SO, YOU TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE AS GOVERNOR IN JANUARY. WHAT IS GOVERNOR HOBBS FIRST ACTION ON DAY ONE AS GOVERNOR?  WELL, I SAID MANY TIMES THAT I WILL CALL A SPECIAL SESSION TO REPEAL ARIZONA'S PRE ROE ABORTION BAN. THIS IS A BAND THAT COMPLETELY CRIMINALIZES ABORTION. IT IS FAR OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE MAJORITY OF ARIZONANS WHO SUPPORT ACCESS TO SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION. WE ARE UNDER THE THREAT OF THIS BEING ENACTED INTO LAW DEPENDING UPON WHAT THE COURTS DO WITH THE INJUNCTION ON PLACE AND IT.  GOVERNOR ELECT KATIE HOBBS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US AS OFTEN AS YOU DID DURING THE CAMPAIGN TO KEEP EVERYONE UPDATED ON WHAT WAS AT STAKE IN ARIZONA. WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US DURING THE CAMPAIGN, AND, OF COURSE, TONIGHT, AS A WINNER.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COMING UP, DONALD TRUMP TURNED TO THE PENNSYLVANIA LEGISLATOR IN 2020 TO TRY TO OVERTURN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.

HE TURNED TO THE PENNSYLVANIA LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO GET THEM TO AWARD PENNSYLVANIA'S ELECTORAL VOTES TO DONALD TRUMP. THAT WAS ILLEGALLY IMPOSSIBLE, SO IT DID NOT HAPPEN. DONALD TRUMP'S POINT MAN IN THE PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WAS DOUG MASTRIANO, WHO JUST LOST HIS CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR. AND CONCEDED THE ELECTION TO DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR ELECT JOSH SHAPIRO. AND THE ELECTION THIS MONTH FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 12 YEARS, DEMOCRATS WON CONTROL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. SO THE PENNSYLVANIA LEGISLATURE WILL NOT BE TRYING TO CHANGE LAWS SO THAT THEY CAN PLAY AROUND WITH PENNSYLVANIA'S 20 ELECTORAL VOTES. AND THEY WON'T BE CONTINUING TO TRY TO PASS A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO BAN ABORTION IN PENNSYLVANIA.  WE ARE TALKING ABOUT WOMEN DYING. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT MORE THAN HALF THE POPULATION NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE DECISIONS WHEN NOT EVEN HALF OF THIS BODY HAS A UTERUS! BUT HERE WE ARE! BEING SILENCED YET AGAIN. AND UNDERSTAND, WHEN YOUR SILENCING US, WE ARE ACTUALLY ELECTED OFFICIALS LIKE YOU ALL. SO, YOU ARE SILENCING MILLIONS OF VOTERS FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE COMMONWEALTH WHEN YOU SILENCE US AND DON'T ALLOW US TO AMEND BILLS THAT WILL LET PEOPLE VOTE. THAT WILL ALLOW WOMEN TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS! YOU ARE SILENCING ALL OF US!  SHE WILL NOT BE SILENCED. THAT IS THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER OF THE PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE. SHE WILL BECOME SPEAKER OF THE PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE IN JANUARY. -- WILL BE JOINING US IN A MOMENT ALONG WITH JOANNA CLINTON -- SHE WILL BE JOINING THAT PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN JANUARY AFTER FOOTING A PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE SEAT FOR THE DEMOCRATS.  WHEN I KNOCK ON DOORS, WHEN I MEAN PEOPLE IN THIS DISTRICT, PENNSYLVANIA'S WANT TO SEE ABORTION PROTECTED IN PENNSYLVANIA. WE BELIEVE THAT IS A RIGHT WE WANT TO SEE WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN AS FULFILLMENT IN OUR STATE. WE KNOW THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AUTONOMY OVER --  AND JOINING US NOW OUR PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE DEMOCRATIC LEADER JOANNA THE CLINTON AND STATE REPRESENTATIVE ELECT MANDY STEEL. AND PRESUMPTIVE SPEAKER, I KNOW I SHOULD NOT PRONOUNCE YOU SPEAKER QUITE YET, BUT I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE SENIOR MOST MEMBER OF THE DELEGATION AND THE JUNIOR MOST MEMBER TONIGHT AND THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO START. HOW DO THE COULD DEMOCRATS DO IT? HOW DO THEY PULL OFF THIS VICTORY THAT HAS TAKEN 12 YEARS FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO WIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN PENNSYLVANIA?  SO, WE WERE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS BIG VICTORY, BY WORKING FAMILIES ALL ACROSS MENTAL -- OUR CANDIDATES KNOCKED MORE THAN 1 MILLION DOORS. THEY WENT STRAIGHT TO VOTERS TO EXPLAIN THE HORRIFIC THINGS THAT WERE HAPPENING IN HARRISBURG. BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME, PEOPLE THINK, OH, THAT'S MY REPUBLICAN WRAP. THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB. THEY SHOW UP TO MY KIDS BASEBALL GAME AND GIVE OUT AN AWARD. BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS, THEY HAD BEEN UNDERMINING VOTERS WILL FOR YEARS. AND UNFORTUNATELY, THEY WERE LETTUCE BRIGHT BY OUR FORMER PRESIDENT AND THEY TRIED TO SILENCE ALL OF US AND MOST RECENTLY, WITH THEIR MAJORITY, THEY MOVED FORWARD A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT, THE FIRST STEP TO BANNING ABORTION HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA.  MANDY STEEL, I HAD MY EYE ON YOUR RACE BECAUSE I WAS TOLD BY SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS THAT AREA, IF MANDY STEEL CAN WIN IN THIS DISTRICT, THAT MEANS THAT DEMOCRATS WILL PROBABLY WIN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN PENNSYLVANIA. WHEN DID YOU FEEL THE WIN WAS WITHIN REACH?  YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY, I FELT IT FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE I FELT A LOT OF TIME OUT ON THE DOORS TALKING TO PEOPLE AND PEOPLE DID NOT WANT TO SEE WOMEN'S RIGHTS OVERTURNED IN THE STATE AND THAT ACROSS ALL KINDS OF DOORS. AND IT WAS CLEAR TO ME FROM THE BEGINNING THAT WE WERE GOING TO VOTE AGAINST THIS EXTREMIST MINORITY. AND VOTE FOR THE PEOPLE. AND IT SURE PLAYED OUT THAT WAY IN A BIG WAY FOR US IN PENNSYLVANIA.  JOANNA MCCLINTON, WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE TO THE INCOMING NEW MEMBERS ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE LIKE MANDY STEELE?  EVERYTHING YOU HEARD FROM THE VOTERS AT THE DOOR, EVERYTHING YOU HEARD FROM YOUR NEIGHBORS, IT IS A MANDATE. THE VOTERS ARE CLEAR. THEY REJECTED FEAR, HATRED. SO NOW, AS WE GO INTO 2023, AND YOU BECOME THAT REPRESENTATIVE, WE ARE GOING TO CRAFT AN AGENDA THAT DEFENSE WORKERS RIGHTS, THAT HELPS FAMILIES WHO HAVE BEEN TRYING SO HARD TO GET AHEAD IN PENNSYLVANIA, WHETHER THE FROM THE WEST WHERE YOU ARE, OR WHETHER THERE FROM THE EASTERN PART OF THE STATE WHERE I SERVE.  MANDY, I THINK PEOPLE HAVE THEIR BEST UNDERSTANDING OF POLITICS BEFORE THEY BECOME TOO DEEPLY PROFESSIONAL. YOU WILL BE MOVING FROM YOUR LIFE OUT THERE AS A CITIZEN KIND OF WATCHING THIS FROM THE GRANDSTAND, TO AN ACTUAL PARTICIPANT DOWN ON THE FIELD. THAT IS WHAT I THINK PEOPLE HAVE A REALLY VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION TO MAKE TO THE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE ALREADY THERE. WHAT INSIGHTS DO YOU THINK YOU CAN BRING TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES NOW THAT YOU ARE COMING IN FROM THE OUTSIDE?  WELL, WHAT IS AMAZING TO ME IS THAT I WAS SO FORTUNATE TO BE THE FIRST WOMAN AND FIRST DEMOCRAT ELECTED TO THE COUNCIL IN MY COMMUNITY SEVERAL YEARS AGO. I JUST HAVE MY SON -- FINAL COUNCIL MEETING TONIGHT. AND NOW I WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR FUTURE LEADER MCCLINTON, THE FIRST WOMAN SPEAKER -- FUTURE SPEAKER MCCLINTON WILL BE THE FIRST WOMAN SPEAKER AND PENNSYLVANIA. MY HEART IS JUST OVERFLOWING IN HAVING THE CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT. AND WHAT I CAN BRING TO THE TABLE IS A COMMUNITY FEEL. I SPENT YEARS IN THE COMMUNITY, GOVERNING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I UNDERSTAND HOW PENNSYLVANIANS WANT TO SEE THE STATE MOVE FORWARD. AND I AM SO EXCITED TO BRING THAT PERSPECTIVE TO THE STATE HOUSE.  FUTURE SPEAKER MCCLINTON, WHAT DID IT MEAN FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE HOUSE IN PENNSYLVANIA, A LEGISLATURE THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS TURNING TO IN 2020 TO SEE IF THERE WAS SOME WAY THEY COULD CRAB PENNSYLVANIA'S ELECTORAL VOTES FOR HIM?  IT MEANS THAT WE ARE TURNING THE PAGE TO ELECTION DENIERS. WHEN 60 OF MY COLLEAGUES, INCLUDING OUR SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE AND ALL OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADERS AND THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE, SIGNED A LETTER, URGING OUR CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO OVERTHROW THE ELECTION, IT WAS COMPLETELY OUTRAGEOUS. THAT WAS MY INTRODUCTION TO BEING THE MINORITY LEADER. IT'S LIKE, ARE WE GOING TO START THE SESSION TRYING TO THROW OUT VOTES? BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. VOTERS IN THIS ELECTION, THIS NOVEMBER, THEY ARE TURNING THE PAGE TO IT AND SO ARE WE.  JOANNA MCCLINTON AND MANDY STEELE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT IN THE WINNERS CIRCLE. REALLY APPRECIATE IT.  THANK YOU.  WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK 20221122035638.510|20221122035851.944",

        "trs": " IT'S CLEAR THAT HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY HAS MADE A WHOLE LOT OF PROMISES IN HIS QUEST TO BECOME SPEAKER, INCLUDING TO CONGRESSWOMAN MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE OF GEORGIA. NOW WHIPPING VOTES FOR HER. YOU WILL REMEMBER GREENE WAS STRIPPED OF HER TWO COMMITTEE SEATS LAST YEAR, AFTER IT CAME TO THAT SHE HAD ENDORSED VIOLENCE AGAINST SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE NANCY PELOSI. BACK IN 2019, GREENE LIKE TODAY FACEBOOK COMMENT THAT SUGGESTED, QUOTE, A BULLET TO THE HEAD WOULD BE QUICKER TO REMOVE PELOSI. SHE ALSO TRAFFICKED IN INSANE FAR-RIGHT LIES, INCLUDING PARTICULARLY IN ANTISEMITIC ONE THAT, GET THIS, THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES WERE A FALSE FLAG, STARTED BY A SPACE LASER ON BEHALF OF THE ROTHSCHILDS AND GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. OF COURSE, THE FAR-RIGHT EXTREMIST IN THE HOUSE ARE NOW SCHEMING FOR REVENGE. KEVIN MCCARTHY IS PLEDGING TO GIVE IT TO THEM BY REMOVING, TIT-FOR-TAT, AS HE VIEWS THAT, DEMOCRATIC, THREE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE MEMBERS FROM THEIR COMMITTEES.  ERIC SWALLOW CANNOT GET A SECURITY CLEARANCE IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. WHY WOULD WE EVER GIVE HIM A SECURITY CLEARANCE IN AND THE SECRETS TO AMERICA? I WILL NOT ALLOW HIM TO BE ON INTEL. YOU HAVE ADAM SCHIFF WHO HAD LIED TO THE AMERICAN PUBLIC TIME AND AGAIN. WE WILL NOT ALLOW HIM TO BE ON THE INTEL COMMITTEE EITHER. CONGRESSWOMAN OMAR, HER ANTISEMITIC COMMENTS THAT HAVE GONE FORWARD, WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW HER TO BE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS.  JOINING ME NOW, ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE, CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, DEMOCRATIC OF CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, A MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE. CHAIRMAN, YOU ARE ACCUSED OF LYING TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHICH IS, APPARENTLY, DISQUALIFYING FOR BEING ON A COMMITTEE, WHICH I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT, WE COVERED A LOT OF POLITICIANS. I DON'T THINK THAT THINGS YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO GET YOUR RESPONSE.  WELL, BY LYING, KEVIN MCCARTHY IS REFERRING TO TRUTH ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, AND HOLDING HIM ACCOUNTABLE, IMPEACHING HIM, LEADING THAT TRIAL, BEING A MEMBER OF THE JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE. LOOK, NOTWITHSTANDING THE BOGUS RATIONALIZATION, THIS IS ABOUT SATISFYING THE LOWEST ELEMENTS OF HIS CONFERENCE, THE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE'S WHO WANT PAYBACK, THE GOSAR, MATT GATES, AND THIS IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS, WHICH IS KEVIN MCCARTHY CAN'T BECOME SPEAKER WITHOUT THE QANON CAUCUS IN HIS CONFERENCE. HE WILL DO IT, MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE WILL TELL HIM TO DO. THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING. IT'S A TRAGEDY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WHETHER I SAY AS CHAIR, OR I DON'T, IT'S NOT THE TRAGEDY. THE TRAGEDY IS, THERE IS SOME SERIOUS THINGS WE NEED TO DEAL WITH AS A COUNTRY, AND IN ADDITION TO THESE PETTY ATTACKS ON PEOPLE WHO HELD TRUMP ACCOUNTABLE, THEY ARE THREATENING DEFAULT ON THE NATION'S CREDIT, THREATENING GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS IF WE DON'T CUT SOME SECURITY MEDICARE, THEY WANT TO INVESTIGATE ANTHONY FAUCI. I MEAN, IT'S ABSURD, BUT WE ARE GOING TO SEE THAT IF REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE SAYING ASYLUM, AND IT LOOKS LIKE ONE, LUNATICS ARE TAKING OVER.  YOU HAVE THIS TO SAY, LAST VOTERS REJECTED EXTREMIST REPUBLICANS AT THE BALLOT BOX, YET DESPITE THAT CLEAR REPUDIATION, REPUBLICANS ARE PLAYING FULL STEAM AHEAD WITH THEIR CONSPIRACY THEORY AGENDA, A POLITICAL SIDESHOW FOR THE QANON BASE. THEY ARE SO DANGEROUSLY OUT OF TOUCH. I WANT TO ASK ABOUT WHAT THIS MEANS FOR GOVERNOR. THERE ARE THINGS THE HOUSE HAS TO DO TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT RUNNING. RIGHT? RAISING THE DEBT CEILING, WHICH YOU MENTIONED, WHICH THEY ARE ALREADY SAYING, BUT PASSING APPROPRIATIONS BILLS IN A TIMELY MANNER TO -- ARE YOU CONFIDENT MCCARTHY CAN WIELD THIS NARROW MAJORITY, TO DELIVER UP THAT THRESHOLD LEVEL, OR ARE THOSE GOING TO BE TOUGH, BIG, YOU KNOW, CATASTROPHES?  NO. I'M NOT AT ALL CONFIDENT HE CAN DO EVEN THE BARE MINIMUM OF THE JOB. YOU KNOW, IT'S ONE THING IF YOU HAVE A LARGE MAJORITY AND YOU CAN SORT OF SAY, WELL, I COULD AFFORD TO IGNORE THE CRAZIES LIKE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. IT'S ANOTHER THING IF YOU HAVE A HANDFUL THAT ARE KEEPING YOU IN THE SPEAKER'S CHAIR, AND THEY ARE CRAZY, AND YOU HAVE TO GO ALONG WITH CRAZY IN ORDER TO DO THAT, TO KEEP THAT JOB, AND THE CRAZY ONES SHOT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT, AND SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. IT'S WHY JOHN BOEHNER WALKED AWAY FROM THE JOB, WHY PAUL RYAN LEFT THE JOB, AND KEVIN MCCARTHY IS NOTHING IF NOT MORALLY FLEXIBLE, VALUABLE AND, YOU KNOW, HE WILL DO WHATEVER HE IS TOLD TO DO, BY TRUMP, AND BY THESE EXTREME ELEMENTS OF HIS CONFERENCE. THAT WILL GET IN THE WAY OF BASIC GOVERNANCE.  YEAH.  YOU KNOW, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT THEIR GOVERNMENT TO WORK, AND I JUST DON'T SEE THEIR ABILITY, EVEN TO GOVERN THEIR OWN, LET ALONE GOVERN THE CHAMBER.  I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE, AND THAT SPEEDING TOWARDS ITS COMPLETION. ONE OF THE BIG OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS, OF COURSE, ABOUT TESTIMONY FROM TWO INDIVIDUALS, VICE PRESIDENT, THEN VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE, AND FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED, AND HE IS CHALLENGING THAT SUBPOENA. MIKE PENCE WHO WAS INVITED, AND IN NEGOTIATIONS AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND IT, JUST CAME OUT WITH A BOOK, HE IS TRYING TO SELL THAT BOOK EVERYWHERE THAT HE CAN GO, AND BASICALLY, HE IS SAYING, IF YOU WANT MY TESTIMONY, YOU'VE GOT TO PAY THE 25 BUCKS FOR IT. THAT COMMITTEE DOESN'T GET IT. HERE IS HOW HE DESCRIBED HIS DECISION THAT YOU DON'T GET TO TALK TO HIM. TAKE A LISTEN.  I NEVER STOOD IN THE WAY OF SENIOR MEMBERS OF MY TEAM COOPERATING WITH THE COMMITTEE, AND TESTIFYING. CONGRESS HAS NO RIGHT TO MY TESTIMONY.  YOU ARE CLOSING THE DOOR ON THAT ENTIRELY?  AND CLOSING THE DOOR ON THAT.  WHY DO YOU THINK HE IS WRONG WHEN HE SAYS CONGRESS HAS NO RIGHT TO HIS TESTIMONY?  BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S BASED ON BASIC, IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT CONGRESS HAS A RIGHT TO. INDEED WE DO HAVE A RIGHT TO HIS TESTIMONY. IT IS WHAT IS HIS RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC AND TO THE COUNTRY? A FORMER PRESIDENT HAS COME AND TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS, CERTAINLY A FORMER VICE PRESIDENT CAN. AS YOU SAY, NO, IT'S MORE PORT IN FOR HIM TO SELL HIS BOOK. IT'S REALLY BASICALLY FOLLOWING THE JOHN BOLTON MODEL. I CAN'T COME IN TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS FOR SOME FICTITIOUS REASON, BUT I CAN PUT IT IN A BOOK AND MAKE MONEY FROM IT. YOU KNOW, LOOK, WE HAVE TO GIVE YOU EVERYTHING MIKE PENCE SAYS AND DOES RIGHT NOW THROUGH THE PRISM OF TWO THINGS, HE WANTS TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, HE DOESN'T WANT TO ALIENATE THE TRUMP BASE ANYMORE THAN HE HAS TO, AND THIS IS HIS WAY OF WALKING THAT LINE. IT REALLY IS A DISSERVICE TO THE COUNTRY, FOR HIM TO PARADE THIS AS SOME KIND OF SANCTIMONIOUS DECISION THAT THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO MY TESTIMONY, IT DOESN'T, OF COURSE, ANSWER THE QUESTION, DOES HE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COUNTRY? CERTAINLY, IF HE WANTED TO TESTIFY HE COULD, AND HE IS WITHHOLDING THAT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.  TO THE EXTENT THERE'S ANY PRIVILEGED PUNCTURED BY THE FACT HE WROTE A BOOK ABOUT. IF HE DOES SEEM TO BE PLANNING IN 2024 RUN ON THE PLATFORM OF, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HANGING MIKE PENCE BIT, I'M WITH TRUMP ALL THE WAY. CONGRESSMAN ADAM SCHIFF, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU.  STILL TO COME AFTER THE RED WAVE FAILED TO ARRIVE, REPUBLICANS ARE BLAMING THE SUPREME COURTS ABORTION DECISION. WHY DONALD TRUMP WON'T EVEN SAY THAT WORD, NEXT.

REPUBLICANS ARE FACING THE AFTERMATH. THEY ARE SEEING THEIR POSITION, WHICH THAT ABORTION SHOULD BE OUTLAWED, FOR OTHERIZE REJECTED, OVER AND OVER FROM COAST TO COAST. THE BACKLASH BEGAN JUST WEEKS AFTER THAT DECISION CAME DOWN AT THE END OF JUNE. CATS VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY REJECTED IT. AN AMENDMENT TO THEIR STATE CONSTITUTION THAT WOULD'VE ALLOWED LEGISLATOR TO BAN ABORTION. THAT VOTE WAS 50 1941. IN A VERY RED STATE. AND IT ISN'T SHOCKWAVES THROUGH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS MONTH,, ABORTION RIGHTS ARE ON THE BALLOT IN SEVERAL MORE STATES. CALIFORNIA, MONTANA, MICHIGAN, KENTUCKY, FREMONT. AND IT WAS A CLEAN SWEEP FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS IN ALL I FIVE STATES. NOW, ABORTION RIGHTS ACTIVISTS IN OTHER STATES WANT TO FOLLOW SUIT WITH THEIR OWN BALLOT MEASURES, INCLUDING IN OHIO WHERE A CURRENT SO-CALLED HEARTBEAT BAN WENT INTO EFFECT THE SAME DAY ROE WAS OVERTURNED. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- SAYS THAT THE PROPOSED VALIDATION OF, QUOTE, IT IS A, WHEN IT'S NOT ENOUGH. NOW, REPUBLICANS IN THE STATE OF OHIO,, AGAINST SERVE, STATES TRUMP THEY'D THAT TRUMP WON BY EIGHT POINTS. THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY WORRIED ABOUT PUTTING THEIR DEEPLY UNPOPULAR POSITION ON ABORTION UP FOR A VOTE TO THE PEOPLE. SO THEY ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR THE OTHER SIDE TO WIN.  SECRETARY OF STATE FRANK RA\u00daL -- BRIAN STEWART PROPOSING WHAT THEY CALL THE OHIO CONSTITUTION PROTECTION AND. THE AMENDMENT WOULD MAKE IT SO THAT A CITIZEN INITIATED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON ANY BALLOT WOULD HAVE TO PASS BY 60% OF THE VOTE. RATHER THAN THE CURRENT SIMPLE MAJORITY.  IF YOU DON'T THINK THAT YOUR IDEA IS BROADLY POPULAR ENOUGH TO MUSTER 60% OF THE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE, AND MAYBE YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER BRINGING IT TO THE BALLOT.  NOW, OKAY, LIKE, YOU ARE TRACKING, THIS RATE? PRO-CHOICE ADVOCATES SAY THAT WE WANT TO PUT A VALIDATION OF, CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ON THE STATE. HAPPENED IN OTHER STATES. THE REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE FRANK BURROW SAYS, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M THINKING? LET US MAKE IT HARDER TO PASS ONE OF THOSE. NOW, THE ROSE CLAIMS THAT THE PROPOSAL IS NO CONNECTION AT ALL TO ANY POTENTIAL BALLOT MEASURE ON ABORTION. BUT HE WANTS TO PUT THE AMENDMENT UP FOR A VOTE DURING THE PRIMARY IN MAY, LIKELY BEFORE AN ABORTION INITIATIVE WOULD MAKE IT ONTO THE BALLOT. AND HERE IS THE BEST PART OF THIS. THEIR OWN PLAN TO MAKE IT HARDER TO PASS A FUTURE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS WOULD REQUIRE JUST A SIMPLE MAJORITY TO PASS. SO IF YOU CAN GET 50 PLUS ONE, MAYBE YOU CAN STOP THE PEOPLE OF OHIO FROM ACTUALLY GOVERNING THEMSELVES WHERE ABORTION IS CONCERNED, WHICH IS THE POINT. IT IS ALL VERY TRANSPARENT. BUT OHIO REPUBLICANS ARE CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY ONES WHO UNDERSTAND. THEY ARE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THIS ISSUE. THEY WILL NOT SAY WHAT THEY REALLY THINK. THE MAN WHO ULTIMATELY DELIVERED THAT SUPREME COURT DECISION ON ABORTION? THE CRIMINALIZATION AND BANNING OF ABORTION IN 13 STATES, THE POSSIBILITY OF A NATIONAL ABORTION BAN, DONALD TRUMP, THAT MAN. HE WILL NOT SAY A WORD ABOUT IT NOW THAT HE IS BACK UP FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN. THAT IS NEXT. 20221122015006.736|20221122015118.541",

        "trs": "> WHEN COURTS BECOME EXTENSIONS OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS, WHEN PEOPLE SEE THEM AS EXTENSIONS OF THE POLITICAL PROCESS, WHEN PEOPLE SEE THEM AS TRYING JUST TO IMPOSE PERSONAL PREFERENCES ON A SOCIETY, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE LAW, THAT'S WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM. AND THAT'S WHEN THERE OUGHT TO BE A PROBLEM.  HI AGAIN, EVERYONE. IT'S 5:00 IN THE EAST. WE SAW WITH OUR OWN EYES DURING THIS MONTH'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS JUST HOW MUCH ANGER OVER THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION TO OVERTURN ROE VS. WADE WAS A DRIVING FORCE FOR VOTERS, HOW THIS FLASH POINT WAS A MAJOR REASON THAT DEMOCRATS WERE ABLE TO STAVE OFF A RED WAVE. IT WAS AN ENERGY THAT WAS SUSTAINED FOR MANY MONTHS SINCE THE DRAFT OPINION OF THE DOBBS DECISION WAS FIRST LEAKED BACK IN MAY. NOW WITH CONFIDENCE IN THE SUPREME COURT AT HISTORIC LOWS THERE'S BRAND NEW REPORTING IN THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" THAT PULLS BACK THE CURTAIN ON ANOTHER POTENTIAL LEAK, THIS ONE HAPPENING YEARS BEFORE THE OVERTURNING OF ROE, REGARDING THE RULING THAT FAMILY-OWNED CORPORATIONS DO NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR INSURANCE COVERING CONTRACEPTION IF IT VIOLATED THEIR RELIGIOUS BELIEFS. THE \"TIMES\" REPORTS THIS. \"IN A LETTER TO CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS AND IN INTERVIEWS WITH THE NEW YORK TIMES THE REVEREND ROB SHANK SAID HE WAS TOLD THE OUTCOME OF THE 2014 CASE WEEKS BEFORE IT WAS ANNOUNCED. HE USED THAT INFORMATION TO PREPARE A PUBLIC RELATIONS PUSH, RECORDS SHOW, AND HE SAID THAT THE LAST MINUTE HE TIPPED OFF THE PRESIDENT OF HOBBY LOBBY, THE CRAFT STORE CHAIN OWNED BY CHRISTIAN EVANGELICALS THAT WAS THE WINNING PARTY IN THE CASE. THE TIMES PUTS THE LEAKS IN PERSPECTIVE WITH THIS. BOTH COURT DECISIONS WERE TRIUMPHS FOR CONSERVATIVES AND THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT. BOTH MAJORITY OPINIONS WERE WRITTEN BY JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO. BUT THE LEAK OF THE DRAFT OPINION OVERTURNING THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION WAS DISCLOSED IN THE NEWS MEDIA BY POLITICO, SETTING OFF A NATIONAL UPROAR. WITH HOBBY LOBBY, ACCORDING TO MR. SCHENK, THE OUTCOME WAS SHARED WITH ONLY A HANDFUL OF ADVOCATES. SCHENCK SAYS HE WAS TOLD OF THE DECISION BY ONE OF HIS DONORS, GALE WRIGHT, WHO CONTACTED HIM AFTER SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD DINNER WITH JUSTICE ALITO AND JUSTICE ALITO'S WIFE. JUSTICE ALITO DENIES THE ACCOUNT SAYING, \"THE ALLEGATION THAT THE WRIGHTS WERE COLD TOLD THE OUTCOME OF THE DECISION IN THE HOBBY LOBBY CASE OR THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE COURT BY ME OR MY WIFE IS COMPLETELY FALSE.\" THE BLOCKBUSTER \"TIMES\" REPORTING HAS SPARKED CALLS FOR INVESTIGATIONS BY LAWMAKERS. SENATOR DICK DURBIN, CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, SAYS HIS COMMITTEE IS REVIEWING THESE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS WHICH \"HIGHLIGHT ONCE AGAIN THE INEXCUSABLE SUPREME COURT LOOPHOLE IN FEDERAL JUDICIAL ETHICS RULES.\" A CLOSER LOOK AT THE U.S. SUPREME COURT FOLLOWING THIS EXTRAORDINARY NEW REPORTING IS WHERE WE BEGIN THE HOUR WITH SOME OF OUR FAVORITE REPORTERS AND FRIENDS. JOINING US KIMBERLY ATKINS STORE, SENIOR OPINION WRITER FOR THE \"BOSTON GLOBE\" AND THE EMANCIPATOR. ALSO JOINING US OUR GOOD FRIEND JOHN HEILEMANN, HOST AND EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF SHOWTIME'S \"THE CIRCUS.\" THE EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF \"THE RECOUNT\" AS WELL. AND FORMER SENATOR CLAIRE McCASKILL'S HERE. ALL MSNBC CONTRIBUTORS. I HAVE TO START WITH YOU, CLAIRE. IT'S ALMOST -- YOU COULD TELL A JOKE. HOW BAD IS IT? IT'S SO BAD FOR THE SUPREME COURT AFTER BEING THE CAUSE, THE DRIVING FORCE FOR DEMOCRATS TO DEFY DECADES OF MIDTERM ELECTION HISTORY JUST GOT WORSE. ANOTHER ACCOUNT OF A LEAK OF ANOTHER ALITO OPINION.  YEAH. AND REMEMBER THE RIGHTEOUS INDIGNATION OF ALL OF THE TRUMP SENATORS AND ALL OF THE RIGHT ABOUT HOW DARE ANYONE LEAK ANYTHING? WELL, IF YOU READ THIS ENTIRE ACCOUNT, AND I URGE PEOPLE TO DO THAT, TO READ ALL ABOUT WHAT THESE GROUPS WERE DOING TO TRY TO INFILTRATE THE COURT AND INFLUENCE THE COURT FROM JOINING THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY TO GETTING INVITED TO PARTIES, THEY WERE -- THERE WAS A CAMPAIGN TO INFILTRATE THE COURT AND -- I MEAN, SHOWING UP TO PRAY WITH MEMBERS OF THE COURT AT KEY MOMENTS. AND HERE ALL ALONG ALITO CLEARLY, BASED ON WHAT I THOUGHT WAS VERY CREDIBLE INFORMATION FROM THIS MINISTER, WAS THE ONE WHO TOLD SOMEONE ABOUT IT. AND I SAID ALL ALONG, IT ONLY MADE SENSE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED THE ALITO DECISION IN DOBBS TO LEAK IT. BECAUSE THEY KNEW, IF YOU KNOW THE HISTORY OF ROBERTS AND WHAT HE'S TRIED TO DO WITH THE COURT, HE WANTS TO BRING THEM TOGETHER IN A NARROW PLACE OF CONSENSUS. AND I BELIEVE HE WAS PROBABLY TRYING TO DO THAT AROUND THE MISSISSIPPI LAW AND TRYING TO NOT OVERTURN ROE BUT RATHER JUST SAY THE MISSISSIPPI LAW WAS OKAY. AND I THINK IT WAS LEAKED BY THE RIGHT TO KEEP HIM FROM BEING ABLE TO MOVE OTHER JUSTICES WHOSE NAMES APPEARED ON THAT LEAKED OPINION. I THINK THEY WANTED TO LOCK IT IN EARLY SO THAT NOBODY HAD A CHANCE TO WANDER BEFORE THE OPINION WAS ISSUED. IT'S THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES SENSE.  IT IS, KIM. AND THE PROBLEM THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS IS THAT THEY DON'T ALL CARE ABOUT THE SAME THINGS. AND THE REASON WE KNOW THAT IS BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL GIVING SPEECHES AND, YOU KNOW, BOO-HOO, WOE IS ME, NOBODY LIKES US ANYMORE, BUT THEN THEY ALL DO THIS. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ROBERTS IS ONLY BECOMING LIKE A JOHN BOEHNER FIGURE, RIGHT? WHO IS VIEWED AS SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING, WHO UNDERSTANDS THE WHOLE OF THE COUNTRY BUT HE'S TOTALLY LOST CONTROL OF THE MORE EXTREME MEMBERS OF THE SUPREME COURT.  YEAH. THIS IS NO LONGER THE ROBERTS COURT IN THAT WAY IN THAT HE NO LONGER SITS AT THE CENTER AND HAS THAT CONTROL OVER THE COURT. I WOULD ONLY QUIBBLE A LITTLE BIT. BECAUSE ALL OF THE JUSTICES DON'T DO THAT. YOU PLAYED A CLIP FROM JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN, WHO HAS MADE A POINT TO NOT SPEAK AT IT & APPEAR AT THE MORE LIBERAL GROUPS, THE LIBERAL -- THEY'RE NOT EQUIVALENT, BUT THOSE WHO WERE CREATED TO BE SORT OF AN ANSWER TO THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY AND TO THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION. SHE DOESN'T THINK THAT THAT'S PROPER. SHE DOESN'T THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES SHOULD DO BECAUSE OF THAT APPEARANCE OF IMPROPRIETY, BECAUSE OF THAT APPEARANCE OF CONFLICT. SO NOT ALL JUSTICES DO THIS, BUT A LOT OF THEM DO, INCLUDING JUSTICE SAMUEL ALITO, WHO HAS GIVEN SPEECHES SINCE THE DOBBS DECISION, ACTING IN MY OPINION AS SOME SORT OF CHRISTIAN CRUSADER THAT IS FIGHTING AGAINST THIS ALLEGED ATTACK ON RELIGIOUS RIGHTS IN AMERICA WHEN IN FACT RELIGIOUS RIGHTS, RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS BY THE SUPREME COURT AND OTHER LAWS AND THE CONSTITUTION IS ONE OF THE MOST PROTECTED FREEDOMS THAT WE HAVE. THAT'S JUST A FALSITY. BUT THAT SORT OF FEEDS INTO THIS IDEA. AND THIS IDEA THAT THIS REPORTING -- I AGREE WITH CLAIRE THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE FOR YEARS, FOR THE BETTER PART OF A DECADE THESE WELL-FUNDED GROUPS HAVE BEEN COURTING THE CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF THE COURT, TRYING TO STOP SHORT OF TELLING THEM HEY, WE WANT YOU TO RULE IN THIS WAY OR THE OTHER BUT SAYING THINGS LIKE WE WANT YOU TO PUT GOD AT THE CENTER OF THE LEGAL DISCOURSE, THE RIGHT TO LIFE AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, AT THE CENTER OF THIS IN A WAY TO REALLY TRY TO COURT INFLUENCE. BUT THE COURT, IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN WORKING BY ALL APPEARANCES. AND IF OPINIONS OR THE RESULT OF THE COURT'S VOTE IS BEING LEAKED TO THIS GROUP, THAT'S EXTREMELY TROUBLING AND THAT'S PRECISELY WHY I THINK MEMBERS OF CONGRESS NOW ARE MOVING AGAIN TO TRY TO PUT THE SUPREME COURT UNDER THE SAME JUDICIAL ETHICS CODES THAT WE SEE OTHER FEDERAL -- THAT OTHER FEDERAL JUDGES ARE HELD UNDER, BECAUSE THIS IS THE OPPOSITE. THESE ARE LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS. THE IDEA IS THEY'RE INDEPENDENT. AND IF THEY'RE NOT THEN SOMETHING ABOUT THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED.  YEAH. AND LET ME BE CLEAR. TO KIM'S POINT, JOHN, AMY CONEY BARRETT, ALITO, AND I THINK ROBERTS HAVE GIVEN SPEECHES COMPLAINING ABOUT THE COURT NOT BEING RESPECTED AS IT USED TO. I THINK THE JUSTICES APPOINTED BY DEMOCRAT PRESIDENTS HAVE TRIED TO WARN THEM ALONG THE WAY. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR IN HER ARGUMENTS FOR DOBBS SAID THE STENCH OF DOING EXACTLY WHAT A REPUBLICAN-LED LEGISLATURE WANTS US TO DO WILL BE ON THE COURT. AND AS KIM SAID, JUSTICE KAGAN HAS TRIED TO WARN HER CONSERVATIVE FELLOW JUSTICES AS WELL. BUT THE CONSERVATIVES DO A WHOLE LOT OF PUBLIC COMPLAINING THAT PEOPLE DO NOT HOLD THE COURT IN HIGH REGARD ANYMORE, AND IT IS THE CONSERVATIVES WHO HAVE DRAGGED PUBLIC OPINION ACCORDING TO GALLUP TO ITS LOWEST RATINGS IN THE HISTORY OF GALLUP ASKING PEOPLE WHAT THEY THINK OF THE SUPREME COURT.  YOU KNOW, I THINK ABOUT WHINING, SELF-PITY, GRIEVANCE, PEOPLE WHO ARE ENTITLED, PEOPLE WHO HAVE A GREAT SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT BUT ALSO SOMEHOW FEEL AS THOUGH THEY'RE PUT UPON. YOU KNOW WHO DOES THAT REMIND YOU OF, NICOLLE?  IT'S AMAZING.  THE SIGNATURE POLITICAL FIGURE OF OUR AGE. YOU KNOW, THAT IN THE TRUMP ERA, AN ERA IN WHICH ALL OF THOSE QUALITIES WERE GLORIFIED AND RAISED UP TO THE HIGH PINNACLE OF THE PRESIDENCY, THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE SEEPED ALSO INTO THE SUPREME COURT ON THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE I GUESS IS MORE -- IS A SIGN THAT A BUNCH OF POLITICAL CULTURE INDICATORS IT IS ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE INDIVIDUAL JUSTICES. I THINK ALL OF US WHO'VE WATCHED THE COURT OVER A LONG TIME WE ALL LIKE CRAVE MORE TRANSPARENCY. YOU KNOW. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WILLIAM BRENNAN OR EARL WARREN WOULD GO AND GIVE SPEECHES AT UNIVERSITIES AND WOULD GO OUT AND THE RARE MOMENTS WHEN THEY WOULD COME OUT AND HOLD FORTH ABOUT THINGS, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE A STUDENT OF THE COURT YOU CONSIDERED THOSE GREAT MOMENTS WHERE THEY WOULD STEP OUT FROM BEHIND THOSE -- IN SOME WAYS OUT OF THEIR ROBES IN SOME WAY AND SORT OF STEP FORWARD IN THEIR PLAIN CLOTHES AND SORT OF TALK ABOUT WHAT THE COURT WAS LIKE OR WHAT THE KIND OF BIG DEBATES WERE OF THE DAY. I WOULD NEVER WANT TO DISCOURAGE THEM FROM ENGAGING IN THAT WAY BECAUSE IN THE BEST CIRCUMSTANCES THEY FEED THE PUBLIC DISCOURSE. BUT IN A WAY IDENTIFYING, IT HELPS DEMYSTIFY THE COURT. UNFORTUNATELY, RIGHT NOW THE COURT'S DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF DEMYSTIFYING ITSELF ON ITS OWN. AND AS YOU POINT OUT, THERE IS ONLY ONE SIDE IN THIS DEBATE TO BLAME FOR THE LOW REGARD THAT THE COURT HAS BEEN HELD IN. IT'S NOT A NEW THING BUT IT'S GOTTEN WORSE AND WORSE. AND I'LL SAY ONE LAST THING TO CLAIRE'S POINT. I MEAN, IF YOU YOU THINK ABOUT THIS STORY, THE PIECE IN THE \"TIMES\" TALKS ABOUT ALL THESE ELEMENTS, ATTEMPTS TO LOBBY, ATTEMPTS TO WORK THE POLITICAL LEVERS, TO TREAT THE COURT LIKE IT'S A POLITICAL BODY. AND KIM TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE MORE THEISTIC KIND OF IMPULSES OF THE RIGHT-WING CRUSADERS. THINK ABOUT THIS. THE KIND OF INFLUENCE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ON THE OUTSIDE NOW ON THE COURT IS FOR DONALD TRUMP THE WAY HE PICKED HIS JUDGES WAS HE TURNED TO THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY AND SAID GIVE ME A LIST. IF YOU'RE ON THE LIST YOU GET ON THE COURT. IF YOU'RE NOT ON THE LIST YOU DON'T GET ON THE COURT. AND THAT -- THE KIND OF PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE THAT KIND OF THING HAS. TO BE A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE YOU'VE GOT TO BE ON SOME GROUP'S LIST. THINK ABOUT HOW UNDERMINING, HOW CORRUPTING THAT IS. WE'RE SEEING IT PLAY OUT EVERY DAY.  THAT'S SUCH AN AMAING POINT. CLAIRE, TO HEILEMANN'S POINT THE NOTION THAT PERHAPS THE INSTITUTION DONALD TRUMP DESTROYED THE MOST FULLY IS THE SUPREME COURT IS STUNNING ON ONE LEVEL BUT OBVIOUS ON THE OTHER. THIS IS THE LATEST APPROVAL RATING FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OR QUITE A LOT OF OF CONFIDENCE IN THE SUPREME COURT. IN 2000 IT'S NOT ON MY LIST BUT IT WAS 60%. IN 2020 IT WAS 39%. BY JULY 2022 IT WAS 28%. NOW, IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT A LIST OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE A 28% APPROVAL RATING, I CAN'T EVEN THINK OF ANY OTHER INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE DOWN THAT LOW. I MEAN, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS WELL ABOVE THAT. UNPOPULAR PRESIDENTS HAVE NEVER REACHED THAT NUMBER. I MEAN, IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY LOW NUMBER AT WHICH TO FUNCTION WITH ANY LEGITIMACY. AND I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK THE CONSEQUENCES ARE OF THE SUPREME COURT, WHICH WAS AT 28% WHO HAD EITHER A LOT OR A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN THE COURT, BEFORE A STORY OF A SECOND LEAK OF A SECOND ALITO OPINION. WHAT HAPPENS?  WELL, I THINK MY FRIEND SHELDON WHITEHOUSE NEEDS TO SPEND AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE OVER THE COMING MONTHS CONTINUING TO EXPOSE WHAT HE KNOWS VERY WELL. THIS IS A SENATOR WHO'S REALLY STUDIED THE FLOW OF MONEY, MONEY WITH A CAPITAL M, TO VARIOUS GROUPS TO TRY TO FILE AMICUS BRIEFS AND TO HINT IN AMICUS BRIEFS TO THE COURT WHERE THEY WANT THEM TO GO ON ANOTHER OPINION. AND THEN REALLY WE NEED TO DO A WHOLE SHOW ON THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY. MOST AMERICANS DON'T --  LET'S DO IT.  -- UNDERSTAND THE TENTACLES OF THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY, THAT THEY RECRUIT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES. YOU'RE TOLD AS I ALAW SUNT IN THIS COUNTRY, NICOLLE, IF YOU EVER WANT TO BE A FEDERAL JUDGE WHEN A REPUBLICAN IS IN CHARGE YOU MUST BE A MEMBER OF THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY. IT'S REQUIRED OF PEOPLE, YOUNG PEOPLE. AND THEN THE GUY IN CHARGE OF IT, LEO, HE WAS SPREADING MORE DARK MONEY IN THIS ELECTION THAN MAYBE ANY OTHER PERSON IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY. SO YOU'VE GOT ONE GUY IN CHARGE OF THE LIST OF JUDGES THAT GO TO THE SUPREME COURT AND SPENDING LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO INFLUENCE CAMPAIGNS BEHIND THE CURTAIN. IT IS SCARY STUFF. AND IT WILL DRIVE THOSE APPROVAL NUMBERS EVEN LOWER IF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC FULLY COMPREHENDS WHAT'S GOING ON.  WELL, AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING FOR, I DON'T KNOW, ABOUT TEN MINUTES AND WE HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE OTHER FLASHING YELLOW LIGHT. I MEAN, A SPECIAL COUNSEL HAS BEEN APPOINTED TO INVESTIGATE DONALD TRUMP'S POTENTIAL CRIMINALITY AROUND JANUARY 6th. GUESS WHO WAS TALKING TO DONALD TRUMP'S CHIEF OF STAFF ABOUT THE FAKE ELECTORS PLOT, WHICH IS VERY MUCH UNDER CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BY THE SPECIAL COUNSEL. GINNI THOMAS. I MEAN, KIM, AT THIS POINT -- AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THE COURT WANTS TO CLEAR ITS NAME WITH THE 72% OF AMERICANS WHO DON'T TRUST IT. WHAT COULD THEY DO IF THEY WANTED TO?  YEAH. I MEAN, I THINK PARTICULARLY WITH THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE ANY POTENTIAL INFLUENCE THAT GINNI THOMAS MAY HAVE HINTED THAT SHE HAS WITH THE COURT NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT IS. BUT I WANT TO GET BACK TO CLAIRE'S POINT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT. WE HAVE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE INDEPENDENT. THEY ARE NOT ELECTED, THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY. THEY HAVE LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO WORK INDEPENDENTLY AND JUDGE THE LAWS AND THE CONSTITUTION BASED ON THEIR OWN INTERPRETATION OF THAT. THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE JUDICIAL AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO GET LOBBIED, RIGHT? YOU HAVE PEOPLE, YOU HAVE INTEREST GROUPS, THEY CONTRIBUTE TO CAMPAIGNS. AND WHAT CLAIRE IS TALKING ABOUT WITH THIS MONEY THAT IS BEING SPENT TO INFLUENCE THE SUPREME COURT IS EXACTLY ANTITHETICAL TO THE WAY THAT BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT IS SUPPOSED TO WORK. AND THAT'S WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHEN IT COMES TO THESE GROUPS. AND THAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH THIS. AND I THINK THE FACT THAT PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND AND PAY ATTENTION TO IT IS THESE GROUPS' BIGGEST ADVANTAGE, RIGHT? I THINK THE MORE THAT WE TALK ABOUT THIS AND BRING THIS UP AND THE MORE THAT CONGRESS BRINGS THIS UP, WHETHER IT IS CONGRESSMAN JOHNSON OR SENATOR WHITEHOUSE OR OTHERS, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE EDIFICATION OF THE PUBLIC THE SAME WAY THAT THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE EDIFIED THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. I THINK LAWMAKERS NEED TO EDIFY THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE THREAT TO THE JUDICIARY, WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE INDEPENDENT BUT IT ONLY WORKS WHEN THAT INFLUENCE IS NOT THERE.  AND YOU KNOW, HEILEMANN, SENATOR WHITEHOUSE HAS BEEN AT THIS FOR A LONG TIME BUT NEVER BEFORE HAVE THE EXIT POLLS SHOWED I THINK WHAT THEY SHOWED. I THINK THE FIRST PIECE OF EXIT POLL DATA THAT WE SAW WAS THIS 60% NUMBER OF EVERYONE WHO VOTED IN THE MIDTERMS THAT DISAPPROVED OF THE SUPREME COURT. IT'S ALSO THE SAME NUMBER VOTERS WHO DISAPPROVE OF THE DOBBS DECISION PP. BUT DO YOU THINK THE POLITICAL CLIMATE COULD FORCE THE SUPREME COURT TO DO SOMETHING IT NEVER HAS EVER APPEARED TO WANT TO DO, AND THAT'S TO APPEAR TO HAVE MORE INTEGRITY THAN MOST AMERICANS THINK IT DOES?  NICOLLE, DO YOU WANT ME TO BE A PIE-EYED OPTIMIST RIGHT NOW OR WOULD YOU LIKE ME --  NO, I WANT YOU TO BE LIKE THANKSGIVING WEEK BRUTALLY HONEST.  YEAH. YOU KNOW, LOOK, IF YOU THINK -- THINK ABOUT ANOTHER INSTITUTIONAL KIND OF REFORM ISSUE LIKE THIS, LIKE CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM, RIGHT? WHERE IF YOU GO AROUND AMERICA OVER THE LAST 30, 40 YEARS EVEN BEFORE CITIZENS UNITED, GO AROUND AND TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT WHETHER THEY THINK MONEY IS CORRUPTING IN POLITICS, WHETHER THEY THINK THERE'S TOO MUCH MONEY IN THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM, WHETHER THEY THINK THAT SOMETHING'S GOT TO BE DONE TO GET THE INFLUENCE OF BIG BUSINESS AND FINANCE, TO MUTE THEIR INTEREST AND NOT HAVE THIS JUST BE A BIG CASINO IN OUR POLITICS, MAN, I CAN GET YOU VERY, VERY HIGH ON POLLS OF PEOPLE WHO WILL SAY DAMN STRAIGHT, GOT TO TAKE CARE OF THAT. AND THEN, YOU KNOW, WE GO TO THE VOTING BOOTHS AND WE VOTE ON OTHER THINGS. BECAUSE IN A LOT OF CASES THESE THINGS FEEL VERY ABSTRACT. NOW, HAS DOBBS CHANGED THAT? I'LL NEVER, YOU KNOW, DOWNPLAY THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DOBBS. WHEN IT FIRST HAPPENED, I SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN HERE, WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE. AND IT HAD AN INCREDIBLY PROFOUND EFFECT ON THIS ELECTION STARTING IN KANSAS LAST SUMMER, ALL THE WAY THROUGH MIDTERMS. IS THE ROLLING BACK OF A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT, IS THAT THE THING THAT TAKES THIS OUT OF THE REALM OF THE ABSTRACT AND ALLOWS PEOPLE TO START THINKING ABOUT THE COURT AND ALL OF THE MECHANICS THAT KIM WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT, THAT CLAIRE IS POINTING TO, WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT, HOW THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY, THE RIGHT-WING MONEY MACHINE, ALL THIS STUFF, CITIZENS UNITED WAS NOT A MISTAKE, IT WAS AN ACT OF POLICY, IT WAS AN IDEOLOGICALLY DRIVEN COURT THAT WAS CARRYING OUT THE INTERESTS OF ITS BACKERS. ALL OF THIS -- THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE NEST OF THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON HERE. AND A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW THEM AND DON'T DO VERY MUCH ABOUT THEM. I WONDER WHETHER DOBBS, BECAUSE IT'S TRANSLATED INTO SUCH A VISCERAL, TENABLE THING FOR SO MANY AMERICANS, WHETHER DOBBS -- AND OPPORTUNITIES PRECEDENTED. WE'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE. A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT PULLED BACK AFTER 50 YEARS OF PRECEDENT. DOES THAT CHANGE THE WAY AMERICA LOOKS AT THE COURT NOT JUST IN LOWERING ITS APPROVAL RATINGS BUT MAKING IT MORE INTERESTED IN A SUSTAINED WAY THAT WOULD DRIVE -- THAT YOU'D NEED TO DRIVE SOME KIND OF VERY HARD LONG FIGHT FOR REFORM, I DO NOT KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION TODAY. BUT THAT IS THE ONLY WAY IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG FIGHT AND PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY CARE FOR A LONG TIME, NOT JUST FOR TEN MINUTES HERE, TEN MINUTES THERE BECAUSE OF ONE STORY OR THE OTHER STORY. THE PUBLIC'S GOT TO BE ENGAGED, GOT TO BE ENGAGED FOR A LONG BATTLE.  I THINK THAT IS THE $64 MILLION QUESTION. RIGHT? IS THAT THE NUMBER? 64? OR IS IT 62? 60 WHATEVER MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION.  64.  AND MITCH McCONNELL IS THE LEGISLATOR MOST RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SUPREME COURT. IF IT HAS BECOME A POLITICAL BALL AND CHAIN THAT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MITCH McCONNELL TO EVER BE THE SENATE MANGT LEADER AGAIN I THINK THAT HAS BEARING ON THE QUESTIONS YOU JUST ASKED, DO THEY CARE. IS THE POLITICAL PRICE TOO STEEP TO PAY? SO INTRIGUING AND SO GREAT TO TALK TO ALL THREE OF YOU ABOUT IT. KIM ATKINS-STORY, JOHN HEILEMANN, THANKS FOR STARTING US OFF. CLAIRE STICKS AROUND FOR THE HOUR. UP NEXT FOR US WHEN WE COME BACK THE REPUBLICAN ELECTION OFFICIAL FORCED TO GO INTO HIDING IN ARIZONA AS THE LOSING CANDIDATE, MAGA FAVORITE KARI LAKE, CONTINUES TO SPREAD DEBUNKED CLAIMS ABOUT THE RESULTS OF A RACE SHE LOST. SOUND FAMILIAR? TOP DEMOCRATIC ELECTION ATTORNEY MARC ELIAS WILL JOIN US TO TALK ABOUT THAT. AND LATER IN THE HOUR WE ARE EXPECTING A NEWS CONFERENCE OUT OF COLORADO SPRINGS. OFFICIALS THERE WILL BE BRIEFING ON THE HORRIFIC MASS SHOOTING AT AN LGBTQ NIGHTCLUB. IT IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN AT 5:30 EASTERN. WE WILL OF COURSE BRING IT TO YOU AS SOON AS IT BEGINS. \"DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE\" CONTINUES AFTER A QUICK BREAK. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. TER A QUICK B.

        "trs": "> NEARLY A MONTH AFTER TAKING OVER TWITTER, ELON MUSK ANNOUNCED THAT DONALD TRUMP CAN REJOIN THE SOCIAL MEDIA GIANT. TRUMP INSISTS HE WILL STICK TO HIS OWN SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM, TRUTH SOCIAL, INSTEAD. HE WAS BANNED FROM TWITTER AFTER THE DEADLY ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL, WHEN HE WAS REPEATING SUPPORT FOR THE RIOTERS. ALSO, BACK ON TWITTER, KANYE WEST WAS LOCKED OUT OF HIS ACCOUNT AFTER MAKING ANTI-SEMITIC COMMENTS. THIS WEEKEND, THE RAPPER TWEETING SHALOM WITH A SMILEY FACE. BEN COLLINS JOINS ME NOW. SO \"R.I.P. TWITTER\" WAS TRENDING AS A HASHTAG THIS WEEK. HOW WILL LETTING TRUMP BACK ON THE PLATFORM SIT WITH PEOPLE. AND THE NAACP IS URGING PEOPLE NOT TO ADVERTISE ON TWITTER AND TO CALL THIS, BASED ON A POLL, WHEN IT WAS TELLING HIS FOLLOWERS, ELON MUSK'S FOLLOWERS, LET ME KNOW IF YOU THINK TRUMP SHOULD BE BACK ON. THAT IS HARDLY WHAT WE WOULD CALL A POLL.  YOU CAN'T THINK OF A LESS SCIENTIFIC POLL OF A GUY POST SOMETHING WITH NO WARNING ON FRIDAY NIGHT TO TWITTER.COM.  TO HIS FOLLOWERS.  EXACTLY. TWITTER IS EVOLVING AND EVOLVING INTO A PLACE WHERE THE INFOWAR HAPPENS. AND IF ADVERTISERS WANT TO BE A PART OF THE INFORMATION WAR, BETWEEN RIVAL FACTIONS WHERE, FOR EXAMPLE, KANYE WEST IS BEING REPLIED TO ELON MUSK AND LIKED BY ELON MUSK SAYING \"SHALOM,\" AFTER BEING TEMPORARILY BANNED FROM THE PLATFORM FOR TWEETING THAT HE WAS ABOUT TO GO DEF-CO 3 ON THE JEWS, AND HE'S TELLING THEM THAT THEY'RE BACK IN THE GAME HERE, I AM NOT ENTIRELY CERTAIN THAT IF I WERE A BRAND NAME ADVERTISER TRYING TO REACH FAMILIES OR CHILDREN OR REGULAR PEOPLE, THIS IS WHERE I WOULD TAKE MY STUFF. BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT'S WHAT ELON IS UP TO NOW. I THINK HE'S TRYING TO GET AS MANY USERS AS POSSIBLE REALLY UPSET ON HIS PLATFORM. GET THEM TO SEE THE CAR CRASH. GET THEM TO CROWD AROUND US. AND THEN SEE WHAT HE CAN DO WITH THAT FROM THERE ON OUT. AND I WANT TO STRESS PEOPLE, THIS IS A WEBSITE, JUST A WEBSITE. IT'S OPTIONAL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THERE. THERE'S OTHER PLACE TO GET NEWS AND TALK ABOUT, IN MY OPINION -- IN MY WORLD, THE NBA OR SOMETHING. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO HERE. THERE ARE OTHER PLACES THAT ARE ABOUT TO POP UP. IF I WERE YOU, I WOULD JUST WAIT IT OUT. I HAVE TO GO THERE, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO.  YOU CAN DO IT FOR US SO WE DON'T HAVE TO.  BEN COLLINS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. > AND IN LAS VEGAS OVER THE WEEKEND, A STRING OF LIKELY REPUBLICAN RIVALS FOR THE 2024 NOMINATION TAKING SWIPES AT DONALD TRUMP, INCLUDING SOME OF HIS MOST LOYAL FORMER CABINET MEMBERS.  PERSONALITY AND CELEBRITY JUST AREN'T GOING TO GET IT DONE. WE CAN SEE THAT.  THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR VICTORY. WE'VE GOT A LOT MORE TO DO AND I HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO FIGHT.  I'VE NEVER LOST AN ELECTION, AND I'M NOT GOING TO START NOW.  THE REASON WE'RE LOSING IS BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP HAS PUT HIMSELF BEFORE EVERYBODY ELSE.  LET'S STOP SUPPORTING CRAZY, UNELECTABLE CANDIDATES IN OUR PRIMARIES AND START GETTING BEHIND WINNERS THAT CAN CLOSE THE DEAL IN NOVEMBER.  THEY'RE ALL REPUBLICANS, BY THE WAY. THE PILE-ON HAPPENING AS ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND NAMES A SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE TRUMP'S ROLE IN THE JANUARY 6th INSURRECTION, AS WELL AS HIS HANDLING OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS FOUND AT MAR-A-LAGO. JOINING US NOW, POLITICO WHITE HOUSE BUREAU CHIEF, JONATHAN LEMIRE, HOST OF \"WAY TOO EARLY\" HERE ON MSNBC, ASHLEY PARKER, NBC NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, YAMICHE ALCINDOR, AND BACK WITH US, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, BARBARA McQUADE. SO ASHLEY, THIS WAS AT THE REPUBLICAN JEWISH COALITION EVENT IN LAS VEGAS. SOME OF THE POTENTIAL CANDIDATES AVOIDED TAKING ON TRUMP DIRECTLY. BUT SEVERAL INCLUDING POMPEO AND LARRY HOGAN, THE FORMER GOVERNOR, CERTAINLY DID. LARRY HOGAN HAS BEEN DOING THAT FOR A WHILE.  THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE SEEING THEM NOT ONLY TAKE HIM ON, THOSE WHO DID, WITH AN ARGUMENT THAT THEY ALL SEEM TO HAVE INDEPENDENTLY COALESCED BEHIND, WHICH IS THIS IDEA, BORN OUT BY SOME EVIDENCE, WHICH ARE THE PREVIOUS THREE ELECTIONS, THAT HE'S A LOSER. AND THAT WHEN THE PARTY FOLLOWS HIM, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY LOSES. AND EVEN THE ONES WHO DIDN'T TAKE HIM ON DIRECTLY, WHAT IS SUCH A STARK AND NOTABLE CHANGE, IS THERE WILLINGNESS TO SORT OF MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR OWN POLITICAL AMBITIONS, REGARDLESS OF THE FACT THAT TRUMP IS RUNNING AGAIN. SO, I WAS PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY WHAT NIKKI HALEY SAID. SHE'S SOMEONE WHO SERVED IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION INITIALLY, AFTER OFFICE. SHE HAD SAID THAT SHE WOULD NOT RUN IF TRUMP RAN. AND THEN, OVER THE PAST, YOU KNOW, YEAR OR TWO, SHE SORT OF SOFTENED THAT STANCE, AND THEN WE SAW THE MOST FORCEFUL TAKE BY HER YET IN THAT CLIP THAT YOU JUST PLAYED AT THE RJC OF SAYING, YOU KNOW, JUST WAIT AND WATCH. I HAVE NEVER LOST AN ELECTION.  AND JONATHAN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WAS ON \"MEET THE PRESS\" WITH CHUCK TODD AND HE DEFENDED TRUMP ON THE MAR-A-LAGO RAID, CLAIMING MORE COULD HAVE BEEN DONE SOMEHOW BY THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A YEAR, AS CHUCK POINTED OUT, AND THEY WERE GETTING NOWHERE AND WERE BEING MISLED. HE CRITICIZED ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND FOR NAMING A SPECIAL COUNSEL TO OVERSEE TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS SUBSEQUENTLY. AND THE MOST STARK EXCHANGE WAS ON JANUARY 6th, WHEN PENCE BLAMED TRUMP'S ATTORNEYS. LET'S LISTEN.  YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT COMMITTED A CRIMINAL ACT? IN FOMENTING THE INSURRECTION? DO YOU THINK A CRIME WAS COMMITTED?  WELL, I -- I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS CRIMINAL TO LISTEN TO BAD ADVICE FROM LAWYERS. THE TRUTH IS, WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS REPEATING IS WHAT HE WAS HEARING FROM THAT GAGGLE OF ATTORNEYS AROUND HIM.  AND JONATHAN, PENCE ALSO REALLY WENT AFTER THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE, QUESTIONING ITS IMPARTIALITY, HAS REFUSED, OF COURSE, TO COOPERATE TO TESTIFY TO THEM. AND MAYBE MOST INTERESTINGLY, HE SAID THAT THE DOBBS DECISION WAS THE THING HE'S PROUDEST OF FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. INTERESTING.  YEAH, AND PENCE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS DELICATE BALANCE SOME OF THESE REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO STRIKE. WHERE ON ONE HAND, THEY ARE CRITICAL OF TRUMP FOR NOT LOOKING FORWARD. FOR LOOKING BACK AT 2020, WE DID HEAR THE REFRAIN FROM A FEW OF THEM THAT THAT VISION HAS COST THEM SOME VICTORIES. SO THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'VE LOST SOME RACES BECAUSE OF THAT. BUT THEY'RE STILL NOT REALLY WILLING TO CONDEMN MUCH OF HIS BEHAVIOR. MAYBE A LITTLE BIT ON JANUARY 6th, BUT THAT'S JUST ABOUT IT. AND THEY'RE QUICK TO RUSH TO DEFEND HIM, SUGGESTING THAT HE IS A VICTIM OF PROSECUTORIAL OVERREACH BY MERRICK GARLAND OR A SPECIAL COUNSEL OR WHOEVER IT MIGHT BE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE, THIS IS WILLIAM BARR. TRUMP'S FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO WE HEARD FROM IN AN INTERVIEW THIS WEEKEND, SAY THAT HE THINKS THAT, YES, THE EVIDENCE IS THERE TO POTENTIALLY INDICT TRUMP. THAT HE THINKS THAT TRUMP WOULD BE A MISTAKE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO NOMINATE AGAIN. BUT WHEN ASKED IF HE WOULD VOTE FOR TRUMP AGAIN TO BE THE NOMINEE, HE SAID, YES, HE PROBABLY WOULD. AND I THINK THAT'S STILL WHERE WE ARE. THAT THESE REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS THAT HAVE AN EYE ON '24 ARE TRYING TO CREATE A LITTLE SPACE FROM TRUMP, BUT THERE'S A LITTLE TO HOW FAR THEY'RE WILLING TO GO, BECAUSE THEY KNOW, AS DAMAGED AS TRUMP IS, AND THIS IS THE WEAKEST HE'S BEEN IN A WHILE, HE IS STILL BY FAR THE MOST POWERFUL VOICE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND PER POLLING, STILL VERY POPULAR AMONG REPUBLICAN VOTERS.  AND YAMICHE, MIKE PENCE IS CLEARLY GOING FOR THE EVANGELICAL VOTE WITH, YOU KNOW, WHICH HE HAS GREAT AFFINITY, HUGE COMMITMENT, BUT TO SAY THAT THE ABORTION DECISION WAS THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT OF THEIR ADMINISTRATION AND HOW PROUD HE WAS OF IT, HE'S GOT TO BE THINKING THAT THERE IS A VERY LARGE FIELD IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FIELD, AND THAT THAT WILL AT LEAST, YOU KNOW, GET HIM THAT IMPORTANT GROUP.  IT'S CERTAINLY A CASE TO BE MADE, THAT'S THAT'S WHY HE'S SAYING THAT. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT ABORTION WAS, ACCORDING TO OUR OWN NBC NEWS EXIT POLLS, THE NUMBER TWO ISSUES IN THE MIDTERMS WHERE WE SAW REPUBLICANS DO SO POORLY ON, WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO IS GET CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. AND YOU HAVE SOME REPUBLICANS WHO ARE VERY, VERY PROUD OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DOBBS DECISION. THIS WAS, OF COURSE, A GENERATIONAL GOAL FOR CONSERVATIVES TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE. AND FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE BACKING MIKE PENCE AND ARE EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS. PEOPLE WHO FRANKLY WHEN I TALKED TO, TURNED THEIR NOSES UP WHEN THEY HAD TO VOTE FOR FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, BUT DID SO WITH THE IDEA THAT ABORTION WAS GOING TO BE WHAT THEY COULD OVERTURN IN THE END, THAT THOSE PEOPLE, MIKE PENCE IS REALLY TRYING TO GO AFTER. I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING HERE, WHEN I SEE ALL OF THESE REPUBLICANS TALKING ABOUT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND SORT OF DUNKING ON HIM AND NOT -- AND TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY CAN GET RID OF HIM, IT REMINDS ME OF JANUARY 6th, ANDREA. WE SAW ALL OF THESE REPUBLICANS COME OUT AND SAY, THIS IS DEMOCRATICABLE, THIS IS TERRIBLE, AND THEN ONE BY ONE, THEY SORT OF QUIETLY GOT BACK INTO THE TRUMP CAMP. WHAT JONATHAN SAID ABOUT THE FACT THAT FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR FIGURES. THAT HE CONTINUES TO BE THE PERSON THAT'S LIKELY GOING TO BE A NOMINEE HERE, AND THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE REAL PROBLEMS TRYING TO CHALLENGE HIM, IT'S TO ME UNDERSCORES THAT WHILE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE CAN TALK, I'M VERY INTERESTED TO SEE WHERE ALL OF THESE REPUBLICANS IN THREE MONTHS, IN SIX MONTHS, IF IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT DONALD TRUMP STARTS WINNING PRIMARIES, WILL WE BE IN A PLACE WHERE THE GOP WILL ONCE AGAIN SAY, THAT WAS REALLY BAD, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, WE HAVE TO STICK WITH HIM. AND PAUL RYAN SAID SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING THIS WEEKEND. HE SAID, I CAN DO A LOT OF THINGS, I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP BECAUSE HE'S LOSING. THAT ALSO TELLS YOU THAT ALL OF THESE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE MAYBE TRYING TO WIN OVER INDEPENDENT VOTERS, THE JANUARY 6th INSURRECTION DIDN'T TURN THEM AWAY, THE DOBBS DECISION DIDN'T TURN THEM AWAY, THE SORT OF SCANDALS WITH ADULT FILM STARS, THE REVOLING DOOR OF PEOPLE GETTING FIRED, THAT WAS OKAY, BUT ONCE THEY STARTED LOSING LECH S ELECTIONS, THAT'S WHAT DID HIM IN.  LET'S TALK ABOUT THE DECISION BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL LATE FRIDAY TO NAME SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH TO OVERSEE THE TRUMP PROBES, BOTH OF THE PROBES. AND TRUMP IMMEDIATELY DAMNED HIM. SO IF HE THOUGHT HE WAS GOING TO GET SOME KIND OF POLITICAL DISTANCING THAT WOULD SATISFY THE TRUMP BASE, CERTAINLY, THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. WHAT DID HE ACCOMPLISH BY LAYING IT OFF, SINCE HE HAS TO END UP MAKING THE DECISION HIMSELF. IS THIS GOING TO BE A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. HE'S STILL GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE THE, SHALL WE PROSECUTE OR NOT?  THIS STRIKES ME AS ONE OF THOSE DECISIONS THAT JANET RENO USED TO SAY, I'LL BE DAMNED IF I DO AND DAMNED IF I DON'T, SO I MIGHT AS WELL JUST DO WHAT I THINK IS THE RIGHT THING. SO THAT MAY HAVE BEEN MERRICK GARLAND'S CALCULUS HERE. HE'S SUPPOSED TO CONSIDER A SPECIAL COUNSEL IF THERE'S EITHER A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OR OTHER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES. AND AS HE APPOINTED OUT, WHEN THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION INVOLVING A FORMER PRESIDENT WHO'S NOW A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT, THAT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE. IT MAY ALSO BE THE CASE THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE ALSO UNDER SCRUTINY. SO THAT WOULD ALSO MAKE IT AN EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCE, IN LIGHT OF THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, AND THE NATURE OF THE CHARGES THEY'RE LOOKING AT HERE. I THINK IT ACCOMPLISHED A FEW THINGS IN DOING THIS. ONE IS THAT EXTRA MEASURE OF INDEPENDENCE THAT SHOULD BE THERE FOR ANYONE OF GOOD FAITH WHO ACTUALLY LOOKS AT THIS. THERE IS ALSO THE ABILITY TO ENDURE THE END OF THIS ADMINISTRATION. MERRICK GARLAND AND OTHERS IN THIS ADMINISTRATION WILL GO WHEN JOE BIDEN LEAVES THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT A SPECIAL COUNSEL WILL ENDURE UNTIL SOMEONE ACTUALLY FIRES HIM OR HIS WORK IS CONCLUDED. AND I THINK MOST OF US HOPE THAT ANY CHARGES WOULD BE EITHER FILED OR NOT FILED WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR OR SO, THERE WOULD BE NO DOUBT MOTIONS THAT ARE FILED BY DONALD TRUMP TO DELAY AND DISRUPT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, THERE WILL BE A LENGTHY TRIAL, AND THEN THERE WILL BE APPEALS THAT FOLLOW THAT. AND SO EVEN AFTER THIS ADMINISTRATION LEAVES, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL WILL ENDURE. AND SO WILL BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THIS WORK INTO THE FUTURE. SO, I THINK IT DOES ACHIEVE SOME THINGS THAT, IN ADDITION TO MERRICK GARLAND'S ABILITY TO FOCUS ON OTHER IMPORTANT PRIORITIES BESIDES THIS VERY IMPORTANT INVESTIGATION.  BARB, WOULD YOU TAKE ANY INFERENCE FROM HIM, HIS APPOINTMENT OF A SPECIAL COUNSEL, THAT POSSIBLY, THEY ARE LEANING TOWARDS A PROSECUTION ON ONE OR BOTH OF THESE ISSUES?  YEAH, I GUESS I WOULD SAY THIS. I THINK THE JACK SMITH, THE SPECIAL COUNSEL, WILL GET THE CALL TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHETHER THERE ARE OR NOT CHARGES THAT WILL BE FILED. BUT I DON'T THINK MERRICK GARLAND WOULD HAVE TAKEN THIS STEP UNLESS HE BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IN AND A VERY REAL LIKELIHOOD THAT SOMEONE WAS GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE A TOUGH DECISION ABOUT THIS. IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A DONE DEAL, BUT I DO THINK IT MEANS THAT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE HERE AND SOMEONE WILL HAVE TO MAKE A TOUGH CALL.  BARBARA McQUADE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

        "trs": "POLICE REMAIN AT THE SCENE OF DEADLY NIGHTCLUB SHOOTING IN COLORADO SPRINGS LAST NIGHT. THEY'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE THE MOTIVE WHEN A GUNMAN OPENED FIRE AT CLUB Q. AND LGBTQ NIGHTCLUB. POLICE DIDN'T BUY THE SUSPECT'S 22 YEAR OLD ANDERSON AND LEE ALDRIDGE. THEY SAY HE OPENED FIRE IMMEDIATELY UPON ENTERING THAT CLUB. THAT HE USED A LONG GUN DURING THE ATTACK. ONE OF TWO WEAPONS HE CARRIED. POLICE -- 18 MORE WOUNDED IN THAT ATTACK. JOINING ME NOW. DON CALLOWAY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST FOUNDER OF THE NATIONAL VOTER PROTECTION ACTION FUND. SUSAN DEL PERCIO, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND FORMER REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM FLORIDA DAVID JOLLY. LATITUDE BOTH MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYSTS. WELCOME, GUYS ON THIS SOMBER SUNDAY. THIS CLUB CALLED IT A HATE ATTACK ON THEIR WEBSITE. THE NIGHTCLUB HAD A MUSICAL DRUG BRUNCH SCHEDULED FOR THIS MORNING. TRANSGENDER DAY OF REMEMBRANCE. THEY HAD AN EVENT SCHEDULE FOR THAT TONIGHT. OFFICIAL MOTIVE IS STILL UNKNOWN BUT MIGHT THIS REFLECT CURRENT RHETORIC ON LGBTQ PEOPLE AND ISSUES IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT INSTINCT GOES TO IT BEING A HATE ATTACK.  1000% IS A REFLECTION OF THE HATEFUL RHETORIC THAT WE CONTINUE TO SEE NOT ONLY BEHIND LGBTQ I A+ PEOPLE BUT PARTICULARLY IN THIS INSTANCE THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY. IT'S THE ONGOING RHETORIC THAT WE CONTINUE AROUND BANNING CRTC, AROUND DEMONIZING JEWISH PEOPLE. THE ANTI-SEMITIC RHETORIC REACHES THE NEWS RIGHT NOW. WIN A MAJOR POLITICAL PARTY SHARES AT LEAST 50% OF THE POLITICAL DISCUSSION OXYGEN AT ALL TIMES. SHOWING SINCE THIS TYPE OF STUFF THROUGH SPEECHES AND RHETORIC AND ACTUAL LEGISLATION. WHAT THEY'RE REALLY SAYING IS THAT IT IS OKAY TO BE -- THESE PEOPLE ULTIMATELY SHOULD NOT BE LIVING. AT LEAST NOT LIVING AS FREELY AND AS CARALEE -- TYPICALLY MEAN WHITE CHRISTIAN HETEROSEXUALS. WHEN YOU HAVE A FULL HALF OF OUR POLITICAL EQUATION SANCTIONING THIS TYPE OF STUFF, WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS GIVING TACIT APPROVAL TO THE SAKE OF BEHAVIOR. PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE NOT ONLY RESTRICTING GUN ACCESS BUT YOUR EXPANDING AND ACCESS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I'VE BEEN WITH YOU NOW FOR FIVE YEARS. BUT MORE THAN THAT. -- COUNTLESS TIMES. PARTICULARLY TODAY -- PARTICULAR RISE ONE OF ALL SPECIFIC COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN EXPECT MORE OF THIS IN OUR POLITICS THAT SERIOUSLY CONTRIBUTED TO IF NOT GIVE ENOUGH TACIT APPROVAL TO THIS TYPE OF STUFF.  I WANT TO PICK UP ON THE GUN PART. COLORADO HAS SUFFERED MULTIPLE MASS SHOOTINGS. COLUMBINE, ANTI-99. 1912. PLANNED PARENTHOOD WON IN 2015. WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE TO PUT A STOP TO THESE REPEATED TRAGEDIES?  WE DON'T HAVE THE PARTICULARS ABOUT THIS INCIDENT. HOWEVER, WE DO KNOW THAT WE NEED A STRONGER GUN SAFETY LAWS. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEMOCRATS MADE A SIGNIFICANT STEP. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT WAS SMALL -- IT WAS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION AND GETTING SOMETHING DONE IN 30 YEARS. I'LL TAKE IT. WE NEED TO KEEP GOING ON IT AND I'LL JUST BREAK IT DOWN INTO RAW POLITICAL WAYS. IT MAKES SENSE FOR REPUBLICANS TO GET ON BOARD WITH THIS IF YOU WANT TO WIN ELECTIONS. THOSE INDEPENDENT WOMEN SUBURBAN WOMEN THAT THEY NEED TO GET TO WIN, THEY HAVE A GUN SAFETY WAS RIGHT UP THERE WITH ABORTION RIGHTS WHEN IT CAME TO THEIR VOTING ESPECIALLY IN A STATE LIKE MICHIGAN OR WE SAW GOVERNOR WHITMER MAKE IT A PRIMARY ISSUE. GUN SAFETY ACQUAINTED WITH -- DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. I DON'T KNOW IF IT CAN HAPPEN ANYTIME IN THE NEAR FUTURE BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE LEGISLATION TO GET IT DONE.  WITH SOME GUYS I'M JUST GETTING HOT OFF THE PRESSES OF STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT BIDEN ON THIS DEADLY SHOOTING. I'M GOING TO READ YOU JUST THE FIRST COUPLE OF SENTENCES. WHILE THE MOTIVE IN THIS CASE -- IN THIS ATTACK, IS IT CLEAR, TO YOUR POINT, SUSAN. WE KNOW THAT THE LGBTQ COMMUNITIES BEEN SUBJECTED TO HORRIFIC AID VIOLENCE IN RECENT YEARS. GUN VIOLENCE CONTINUES TO HAVE A DEVASTATING A PARTICULAR IMPACT ON LGBTQ+ COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR NATION AND THREATS OF VIOLENCE ARE INCREASING. THE PRESIDENT GOES ON TO STATE SEVERAL THINGS NOT ONLY REFLECTING THAT WHICH HAPPENED THERE, HORRIFIC ATTACK IN 2016 PULSE NIGHTCLUB IN ORLANDO. AS WE LOOK AT CONGRESS DAVID IT DID COME TOGETHER THIS YEAR TO PASS BIPARTISAN GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION. CAN LAWMAKERS AGAIN COME TOGETHER TO ADDRESS GUN CONTROL OR WILL THIS DIVIDED CONGRESS PREVENT ANY POTENTIAL EFFORTS TO MAKE THE COUNTRY SAFER AND RAIN IN THE OUT OF CONTROL GUN PROBLEM WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY.  NOTHING WILL BE DONE. I SAY THAT WITH ELEMENT. THE DIFFERENCE IS IN THE PREVIOUS CONGRESS, YOU HAD BOTH MAJORITIES CONTROLLED BY DEMOCRATS IN THE DEMOCRAT OF THE WHITE HOUSE. AND THE DIVIDED GOVERNMENT WITH REPUBLICANS CONTROLLING THE HOUSE. YOU WILL SEE NOTHING ON GUN CONTROL. AND THE SAD THING IS I THINK YOU SAW THIS IN JOE BIDEN'S COMMENTS. THERE ARE TWO ABSOLUTE TRUTH IN THIS MOMENT THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DISTILL TOO MUCH FURTHER. ONE'S GUN CONTROL POLICY IN AMERICA CONTINUES TO FAIL OUR COMMUNITIES. PARTICULARLY, OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. IT'S NOT WORKING. IT'S NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AND THAT FAILURE IS A NEW. THE OTHER TRUTH IS THAT HATE STILL EXISTS IN AMERICA. AND PARTICULARLY FOR MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND THE LGBT COMMUNITY. I DON'T WANT TO DRAW A DIRECT LINE TO THE SPECIFIC POLITICAL ACTORS. BUT TAKE THE ENVIRONMENT WE'RE IN WHICH YOU HAVE A DON'T SAY GAY BILL IN FLORIDA. THAT PUBLIC POLICY IS BEING CHAMPIONED BY REPUBLICANS IN FLORIDA. DID NOT COME ABOUT OUT OF THIS MASSIVE EXPRESSION OF THE PUBLIC ABOUT HETEROSEXUALITY. IT CAME ABOUT OUT OF A FEWER PEOPLE IDENTIFIED AS LGBT PUBLICLY. AND KIDS BEING EXPOSED TO IT. THERE IS AN INNATE BIAS AGAINST THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY THAT'S INTERSECTION BETWEEN FALCON POLICY AND HATE IN OUR CULTURE. IT'S WHAT RESULTS IN THE EVENTS OF LAST YEAR.  IT IS HEARTBREAKING. I WISH WE COULD SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AMONG THE FOUR OF US. WE CAN'T. LET ME AT LEAST THANK YOU FOR THAT WONDERFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT IT AND MOVE ON TO THIS. WITH REGARD TO THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS. WHO ARE PLEDGING MULTIPLE INVESTIGATIONS INTO PRESIDENT BIDEN TO HUNTER BIDEN AND OTHERS ONCE THEY TAKE THE HOUSE MAJORITY IN JANUARY. LET'S TAKE A LISTEN TO THAT.  I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THIS IS AN INVESTIGATION OF JOE BIDEN. AND THAT'S WHERE THE COMMITTEE WILL FOCUS IN THIS NEXT CONGRESS. THIS  IS THE FOCUS OF THE GOP -- WE CAN IMPEACH SECRETARY MAYORKAS. WE CAN IMPEACH MERRICK GARLAND. I'M  INTRODUCING ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST JOE BIDEN ON MONDAY.  THIS IS JUST POLITICAL PAYBACK INTO AMERICANS EVEN HAVE THE APPETITE FOR IT?  IT'S ENTIRELY POLITICAL PAYBACK. IT'S EXTRAORDINARY NON SUBSTANTIVE. THESE FOLKS ISSUED IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES WHEN THEY WERE IN THE MINORITY OVER THE LAST TWO YEAR SO THERE'S NO TELLING WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IN JANUARY. THERE'S SOME TELLING EXACTLY HOW MANY WILL SEE BUT YOU KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE SEVERAL IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES. NOBODY IN THAT AUDIENCE EVEN THOSE WHO SECRETARY MAYORKAS IS WHO IS HERE SHE THE SECRETARY OF. IT'S NOT ABOUT SUBSTANCE. THIS IS ABOUT SILLINESS AND POLITICS AND REPUBLICANS TRYING TO THROW OUT SOME RED MEAT EVEN WHEN THERE'S NOTHING REALLY UNDERPINNING IT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FRUSTRATES ME MOST ABOUT HOW WE TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS. WE DISCUSS THEM AND SO THEY'RE LEGITIMATE. WHY DO WE EVEN TALK ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN'S LAPTOP AS THOUGH IT'S A REAL THING? WHY DO WE HONOR THE IDEA THAT HUNTER BIDEN LEFT A LOCK TOP AT A SHOP AND NOW IT'S SOMEHOW THOSE ELEMENTS HAVE BECOME DISCOVERABLE AND NOW HURT THE PRESIDENT. WHY DO WE TALK ABOUT THAT IS THOUGH IT'S A REAL THING THAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED WHEN IT WAS A THEORY PUSHED BY THE DUDE THAT SELLS PILLOWS AND CRAPPY PILLOWS THAT THAT. WE JUST HAVE TO, AS PEOPLE -- NOT ONLY A SUMMER CROWDS WHAT AS PEOPLE OF GOOD CONSCIENCE AND GOOD FAITH. LET'S STOP ACCEPTING THIS CRAZY AS THOUGH IT HAS INTELLECTUAL PARITY AND SHOULD BE DISCUSSED AMONG REASONABLE THINKING ADULTS AS THOUGH IT'S A REAL THING. IT'S NOT. SO TO BOTH OF, YOU BECAUSE WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. HE DIDN'T REPUBLICANS CAMPAIGN IN THE MIDTERMS ON ECONOMY AND CRIME? ISN'T THAT WHAT VOTERS WANT? WHAT THEY SHOULD BE PROMPTING INSTEAD? ARE THEY GOING TO PLAY INTO THEIR HANDS, SUSAN?  YOU ARE ASKING FOR LOGIC WITH A BUNCH OF ILLOGICAL PEOPLE. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE IS TALKING ABOUT IMPEACHMENT AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN. BUT YOU CAN'T SPELL IMPEACHMENT. IF YOU CAN TELL WHETHER TO CAUSE A IMPEACHMENT ARE. BEFORE YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT LOGICAL DISCUSSION. YOUR SEGMENT WAS ON THE PRICE OF THANKSGIVING DINNER. AND THE COSTS, AND HOW MUCH IT HAS GONE UP. THAT IS WHAT THE HOUSE SHOULD BE INVESTIGATING, SUPPLY CHAIN AND OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE LED TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES. THE FACT THAT BASICALLY MOST OF OUR FOOD IN OUR COUNTRY THAT IS BEING SOLD TO US IS UNDER A MONOPOLY. THOSE ARE THINGS WORTH INVESTIGATING. I KNOW YOU WANT TO TURN OVER TO DAVID. I'M JUST GONNA, SAY DAVID GREAT SET. I LOVE. IT IT IS SPECTACULAR.  I AGREE ON. THAT LAST FINAL WORD TO. YOU  HOLIDAY SPIRIT.  WE APPRECIATE THAT, PARTICULARLY ON THIS SUNDAY. LAST WORDS TO YOU DAVID. THE INVESTIGATION WILL BE A FACE PLANT FOR REPUBLICANS. THEY WILL ALSO BE MET WITH A SWIFT RESPONSE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, A GROUP I'M NOW AFFILIATED WITH WILL BE THE LEADING INSIDE GROUP DOING RAPID RESPONSE. CALLING TO CHECK REPUBLICANS ON FIRST FACTS, YOU DON'T NEED TO MAKE ALLEGATIONS BASED ON WHAT YOU JUST READ ON THE INTERNET. HELP, OPERA SEE YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED IN YOU THIS YEAR IN THE TRUMP. HARRIS AND YOU ALSO REFUSED YOUR OWN MEMBERS OF, USE SUBPOENA. REQUESTS NOT GONNA BE ISSUING. THEM AND WHAT WE CALL THE CORRUPT. BARGAIN GAVITT MCCARTHY SCRIPT. BARGAIN TO BECOME, SPEAKER HE IS AGREED TO USE THE HOUSE FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES. JIM JORDAN SAYS THIS IS ABOUT FRAMING JOE BIDEN IN 2024, AND GETTING TRUMP ELECTED. KEVIN MCCARTHY IS USING HIS POWER TO BECOME SPEAKER BY AGREEING TO INVESTIGATE WHAT SHOULD ALREADY HAVE BEEN SETTLED ON. GO . OKAY TO MY SUNDAY, FAMILY I LOVE YOU. YOU GUYS INTO YOUR SUNDAY, THANK YOU SO. MUCH OF HIS BUSINESS LAST WEEK WAS DESCRIBED AS LOW. ENERGY THERE ARE OTHER THINGS. MISSING WHEN DONALD TRUMP TOOK THE STAGE. THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT.

I LOVE SAM OKTOBERFEST BUT THIS MIGHT BE BETTER.  LET'S TRY THIS FOR REAL. I DON'T LIKE THAT. THIS IS THE KIND OF BEER SOMEBODY BRINGS TO A PARTY AT YOUR HOUSE AND THEN SITS IN THE FRIDGE FOR LIKE EIGHT MONTHS AND THEN ONE DAY YOUR BUDDY COMES OVER AND SAYS YOU HAVE A BEER?  YOU SHOULD SELL THIS YEAR AROUND.  SORRY. JUST GRABBING ONE MORE. OH! LAUNCHER. MY BAD.  SAM ADAMS, REAL BOSTONIANS AGREE.  IT IS SWEET AND [ BLEEP ] BUT THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO DRINK.  PRETTY FUNNY. THAT'S \"SNL\" SPOOF OF A SAM ADAMS COMMERCIAL. THE FOUNDING FATHER WAS AN AMERICAN PATRIOT AND A REVOLUTIONARY. A NEW BIOGRAPHY OF THE OFTEN OVERLOOKED FIGURE IS MET WITH CRITICAL ACCLAIM. CALLED WILDLY ENTERTAINING BY \"THE NEW YORKER\" AND REV LA TORI AND FREQUENTLY RIVETING BY \"PUBLISHERS WEEKLY\" AND MADE OPRAH'S BEST OF THE FALL LIST! JOINING US NOW HISTORIAN AND AUTHOR OF THE BOOK, \"THE REVOLUTIONARY SAMUEL ADAMS\" STACY SCHIFF. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND JONATHAN CAPEHART JOINING THE TABLE AND YAK I CAN FROM \"THE WASHINGTON POST.\" WE APPRECIATE YOU ALL BEING WITH US. WE CAN START WITH THIS CONCEPT AND THEN WE'LL ALSO TALK POLITICS. BUT FIRST, STACY, TELL US WHAT MOTIVATED THIS BOOK AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL SURPRISE THE READER THE MOST?  IT WAS 2016 AND I WAS THINKING AS I THINK WE ALL WERE ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF AMERICA AND AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND A MOMENT THAT RESONATED WITH THE MOMENT WE WERE LIVING AND EACH FOUNDER SAYS CLEARLY A DRIVING FORCE IN THE CAUSE THAT PREDATES THE REVOLUTION AND THAT'S SAMUEL ADAMS. THE MOST PERSEVERING MAN OF THE REVOLUTION AND GONE MISSING. WHO WAS THIS INDIVIDUAL WHOM HISTORY HAS FORGOTTEN AND CONTEMPORARIES CALL THE FOUNDER OF THE CAUSE, CHANGES THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF AMERICANS BEFORE A SHOT IS FIRED.  I'LL OPEN UP THE TABLE TO QUESTIONS, BUT FIRST, WHAT PARALLELS DID YOU FIND BETWEEN ADAMS' DAY AND THE POLITICAL MOMENT RIGHT NOW?  IT IS A TUMULTUOUS TIME AND FELT CONSONANT IN THAT RESPECT. THE MEDIA IS EXPLODING AND IDEAS ARE EXPLODING ALONGSIDE THE MEDIA. ONE OF HIS GREATEST COUNTRY BUGSS IS REALLY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE THE MEDIA AND PROPAGANDA AND PUT IDEAS ON THE PAGE, HOW TO PULL IDEAS OUT OF THE AIR. IT IS A MOMENT OF A FEELING THAT GOVERNMENT IS UNRESPONSIVE, PEOPLE ARE FEELING THAT GOVERNMENT IS NOT REPRESENTING THEM, DOESN'T HEAR THE NEEDS, DEAF TO THEM. INCOME EQUALITY PLAYS A ROLE SO THAT YOU HAVE AN ALMOST A FEELING THAT THERE'S A CLASS CONFLICT IN SOME WAY. PARLIAMENT IS NOT RESPONDING TO PEOPLE AND AN ELITE IS RULING THE COUNTRY.  GENE?  FIRST OF ALL, WHY HAS SAMUEL ADAMS BEEN SORT OF FORGOTTEN? I GUESS HE IS A COUSIN OF JOHN ADAMS? IS THAT RIGHT? I ALSO WONDER HOW THE TWO GOT ALONG SINCE NEITHER SEEM TO GET ALONG WITH ANYBODY.  JOHN DOESN'T. SECOND COUSINS. SAMUEL IS 13 YEARS OLDER AND RECRUITS JOHN AS MANY PEOPLE TO THE CAUSE. ANOTHER CONTRIBUTION IS RUNNING A RECRUITING OFFICE FOR THE REVOLUTION. SAMUEL IS THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY PULLS JOHN IN FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS THEY WORKS HAND IN GLOVE AND AGREE THAT THE CROWN OFFICIALS IN BOSTON IS -- HOW HE GETS WRITTEN OUT IS HIS OWN FAULT. DOESN'T LEAVE PAPERS. JOHN WHO BELIEVES THAT EVERYONE SHOULD WRITE ABOUT HIMSELF TELLS SAMUEL TO DO SO AND IGNORES THE ADVICE. JOHN SAYS IT WOULD EXPLAIN THE REVOLUTION AND A MODEST MAN. HE IS -- THIS IS THE NO FINGERPRINTS SCHOOL OF REVOLUTION. THE RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD BE DIFFUSE. NAMES DISGUISED. THERE'S A TREMENDOUS SCENE IN THE WRITINGS IN WHICH HE TALKS ABOUT SAMUEL ADAMS FEEDING THE PAPERS TO THE FIRE SO THE CONFEDERATES ARE NOT COMPROMISED.  TRUMP USED TO EAT THE PAPER. JONATHAN CAPEHART?  IT IS GREAT TO SEE YOU. I'M GLAD YOU TALKED ABOUT SAMUEL ADAMS NOT KEEPING THE PAPERS BECAUSE IT TIES IN DIRECTLY TO THE QUESTION I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU. READ \"CLEOPATRA\" BECAUSE WHAT MADE THAT BOOK BRILLIANT IS USING LIKE THE ONE KNOWN PHRASE OR SENTENCE TIED TO HER AND TURNED IT INTO A HUGE BOOK, BIOGRAPHY OF THIS MYSTERIOUS AND SPECTACULAR WOMAN AND SO I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU, WHICH WAS EASIER TO WRITE, CLEOPATRA GIVEN A PHRASE OR SENTENCE ATTRIBUTED TO HER BUT CONSTRUCTED HER LIFE OR SAMUEL ADAMS? HE HAD NO PAPERS, NOTHING. HOW DID YOU GO ABOUT WRITING THIS BOOK?  FORTUNATELY THAT WAS ONE FIRE THAT WE KNOW OF. A GREAT DEAL STILL SURVIVES. IT IS AN INTERESTING PARALLEL BECAUSE YOU WRITE FROM THE ENEMIES IN LARGE PART. WE KNOW FROM ROMAN MEN WRITING ABOUT A GREEK WOMEN AND WE HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT ON SAMUEL ADAMS FROM THE CROWN OFFICERS, THE CUSTOMS OFFICIALS, THE GOVERNOR AND LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR IN BOSTON TRYING TO REIN IN THE INDIVIDUAL RUNNING CIRCLES AROUND THEM. THE CHIEF INSINDIARY. SEEMS TO BE TWO STEPS AHEAD OF THEM AND BEAUTIFULLY PRESERVED IN THE BRITISH ARCHIVES AND THE CORRESPONDENCE SAVED FROM THE FIRES.  PULITZER PRIZE WINNING AUTHOR STACY SCHIFF. THANK YOU. WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING ON.  THANK YOU. > TOP NEWS STORIES OF THE DAY. CHRIS MATTHEWS, THE NEWS ABOUT NANCY PELOSI STEPPING DOWN AND STAYING IN CONGRESS. IT WAS A BIG MOMENT. AN END OF AN ERA REALLY. ALSO SHE WAS GROUNDBREAKING IN HER LEADERSHIP ROLE BEING THE FIRST WOMAN SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. SECOND IN LINE TO THE PRESIDENCY AND DELIVERED TO AN AUDIENCE WITH SOME REPUBLICANS IN IT BUT NOT CLAPPING. SOME DIDN'T SHOW UP. YOU KNOW? DEMOCRATS OF COURSE SUPPORTING HER. SHE MADE A PRETTY BEAUTIFUL SPEECH. THERE ARE SOME ACHIEVEMENTS IN HER LIFE SHE WILL PUT AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. HEALTH CARE. SHE WAS PIVOTAL. IT WOULDN'T BE THERE. IT WOULDN'T HAVE PASSED WITHOUT HER. SO IF YOU COULD TALK A BIT ABOUT THE LEGACY AND ALSO THIS MOMENT OF GRACELESSNESS.  YEAH. WORKING FOR TIP O'NEILL FOR SIX YEARS AND I REMEMBER THE LAST NIGHT HE WAS SPEAKER THE SECRETARY PUT TOGETHER A GET TOGETHER IN THE BACK ROOM AND NOBODY ELSE KNEW ABOUT THIS. BOB DOLE AND BOB MICHAEL. THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERS. SITTING AROUND LIKE SHIVA ENDING A CAREER AND DRINKING COFFEE. DOLE COULDN'T USE BOTH HANDS AND HELPED HIM AND IT WAS A VERY PERSONAL THING AND BIPARTISAN. THAT WONDERFUL LINE WHEN SHE TALKED ABOUT AND THROUGH THE NIGHT THE FLAG WAS STILL THERE.  YES.  WHAT A POETIC LINE.  YES.  FROM THE \"STAR-SPANGLED BANNER.\" THE FEW GUYS IN THE CORNER STOOD UP AND APPLAUDED. THAT IS REALLY BAD BECAUSE WHY CAN'T YOU SALUTE SOMEONE WHO SERVED FOR EIGHT YEARS AS LEADER AND LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATS FOR 20. THAT IS YOUR LIFE.  WHY.  SHE IS LEADING YOUR LIFE AND CAN'T CELEBRATE THAT?  YOU CAN'T FIND SOMETHING? THAT'S THE PART THAT HURTS.  SOMETHING SICK ABOUT POLITICS AND HAS TO DO WITH MONEY.  IN TODAY'S POLITICS.  GIVE MONEY TO A POLITICIAN AND WANT THEM TO BE YOUR FRIEND. DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM WITH THE OTHER SIDE. HOW CAN SHE BE FRIENDS WITH THEM IF I GIVE HER MONEY AND SHE IS MY FRIEND? IT IS ABOUT MONEY. STOP THINKING YOU BUY FRIENDSHIP GIVING SOMEBODY SOME MONEY.  BACK IN 2019 I WORKED ON A MSNBC DOCUMENTARY ABOUT HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI TRACING THE RISE IN POLITICS TO THE LEGISLATIVE BATTLES ON CAPITOL HILL AND A MOMENT TO HIGHLIGHT HOW SHE RAN CIRCLES AROUND THEN PRESIDENT TRUMP HERE SHE IS TALKING ABOUT THAT.  THE SECOND SPEAKERSHIP FOR PELOSI IS TRULY IMPORTANT ONE. IT IS PITTED HER AGAINST PRESIDENT TRUMP AS THE LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  THE FIGHT STARTED THE MONTH BEFORE SHE WAS SWOURN IN WHEN SHE AND CHUCK SCHUMER MET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT A DEAL THAT WOULD INCLUDE BUILDING THE WALL HE PROPOSED ON THE MEXICAN BORDER.  THE PRESIDENT SO OFTEN MAKES STUFF UP. NUMBERS, FACTS. WE'LL CONFRONT.  IF I NEEDED THE VOTES I WOULD HAVE THEM IN ONE SESSION. IT WOULD BE DUB.  THEN DO IT.  TO THOSE THAT QUESTIONED THE ABILITY TO DUEL WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP THE WAY SHE CONDUCTED HERSELF WAS A TURNING POINT.  THERE ARE NO VOTES IN THE HOUSE FOR A WALL. NO MATTER WHERE YOU STARTED.  WE PLANNED TO ONE-TWO PUNCH BUT IT WORKED BEYOND THE WILDEST EXPECTATIONS.  MOST UNFORTUNATE THING. WE CAME IN GOOD FAITH AND ENTERING INTO THIS DISCUSSION IN THE PUBLIC VIEW.  IT'S CALLED TRANSPARENCY.  I WANTED TO SAY WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN PUBLIC BECAUSE WE HAVE TO CONTRADICT YOU? IT WAS HIS INSISTENCE THAT THE PRESS STAY THERE.  WOW.  I THINK THAT HE THOUGHT HE COULD JUST GET AWAY WITH SAYING WHATEVER HE WANTED TO SAY WITHOUT ANY CHALLENGE.  YEAH. DID IT STRIKE YOU AT THAT MOMENT MAYBE HE IS NOT VERY SMART?  NO. I'M NEVER SURPRISED. THIS LOOKS LIKE A PERSON USED TO GETTING HIS OWN WAY.  I AM PROUD TO SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT FOR BORDER SECURITY BECAUSE THE PEOPLE DON'T WANT CRIMINALS AND PEOPLE WITH PROBLEMS AND DRUGS POURING INTO THE COUNTRY SO I WILL TAKE THE MANTLE. I WILL BE THE ONE TO SHUT IT DOWN.  THE PERSON SHUTS THE GOVERNMENT DOWN ALMOST ALWAYS LOSES.  JUST THAT HE DID. AND HE DID. AND HE DID. AND HE DID. THAT JUST BROUGHT ME BACK AND I'M A LITTLE TRIGGERED. BUT NANCY PELOSI -- SHE NEVER GETS TRIGGERED. KEEPS THE GRACE EVEN IN THAT MOMENT. YOU COULD SEE THE PARALLEL. SORRY. BETWEEN GRACE AND GRACELESSNESS SHE IS GRACEFUL. TRUMP WAS GRACELESS. DIFFICULT. MEAN. RACIST. SEXIST. CRUEL. MEAN. UNDERMINING. UNEMPHATHETIC PRESIDENT.  THIS WOMAN IS SO FAR AHEAD. YOU WRITE ABOUT THIS. KNOW YOUR VALUE. SHE HAD HER OWN SCHEDULE. SHE WAS GOING TO RUN BEFORE STENY HOYER. RUNNING FOR SPEAKER IN 2001. HAD IT ALL PLANNED AND A SCHEDULE AND KEPT TO IT. SHE WON EVERY ONE OF THE RACES.  THE GREAT THING ABOUT SEEING WHAT WE SAW IS IT SHOWS JUST HOW PREPARED SPEAKER PELOSI IS GOING INTO A MEETING LIKE THIS AND SAW HER CORE STRENGTH. SHE IS -- HER FAITH IN TO THE CONSTITUTION AND HER REVERENCE FOR THE CONSTITUTION AND THE PRESIDENCY SHE DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION IN PUBLIC FORCING THEM TO CONTRADICT THE PRESIDENT. SHE RESPECTED THE PRESIDENCY. WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT NANCY PELOSI YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HER REVERENCE AND FAITH IN THE CONSTITUTION IS SECOND ONLY TO HER CATHOLIC FAITH. SHE REVERES BOTH AND BOTH GROUND HER AND THE LEADERSHIP.  WHAT I SAW FROM STUDYING HER IN THAT MOMENT INSTEAD OF PLAYING FOR THE CAMERAS SHE STUCK TO THE CORE VALUES AND SPOKE TO THE MOMENT.  YEAH. I HAVE TO SAY OUR COLLEAGUE PAUL KANE HAD A 65-MINUTE INTERVIEW WITH HER AFTER THE SPEECH AND HE SAID THAT SHE WAS STILL PRETTY STEELY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. SHE WASN'T WEEP PI OR EMOTIONAL ABOUT THE MOMENT WHICH I THINK ANY PERSON MAN OR WOMAN WOULD BE REALLY CAUGHT UP IN THE EMOTION OF IT.  YEAH.  BUT WAS VERY MATTER OF FACT. SHE SPOKE ABOUT HAVING SURVIVOR'S GUILT ABOUT HER HUSBAND AND THAT TO ME IS SORT OF ONE OF THE MORE SHOCKING THINGS THAT REPUBLICANS -- HOUSE FUTURE POTENTIALLY HOUSE SPEAKER KEVIN McCARTHY DID NOT ATTEND THE MEETING. STEVEN MILLER JETTED INTO THE OFFICE AN HOUR BEFORE AND McCARTHY NEVER EMERGED.  MILLER IS THE ADVISER NOW?  STILL A QUESTION.  WHAT IS GOING ON?  APPARENTLY THEY'RE FRIENDS. JUST HAVING A CONVERSATION. BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE REPORTING TO BE DONE THERE AND PELOSI TOLD PAUL KANE THAT'S WHAT HURT HER MOST. REPUBLICANS APPLAUDED THIS PERSON WHO ATTACKED HER HUSBAND, WHO IS STRUGGLING. CAN ONLY INTERACT WITH PEOPLE FOR LIMITED MOMENTS. HAS TO SIT IN DIM ROOMS. RECOVERING FROM A SEVERE HEAD AND BRAIN INJURY AND THERE IS NO EMPATHY OR SYMPATHY EXPRESSED BY REPUBLICANS FOR WHAT THEY HAVE GONE THROUGH AND HER GRANDCHILDREN AND TALKED ABOUT HOW SHE IS STILL LIVING IN THE HOUSE WHERE HE WAS ATTACKED AND SO IT'S SORT OF THIS CONSTANT TRAUMA AND THAT SHE -- SURVIVOR'S GILTD FOR HER NOT BEING THERE. NOT OF -- THE ONE THIS PERSON LOOKING TO ATTACK AND COULDN'T FIND HER AND THAT THAT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING FOR HER. EVEN IN THE CONTEXT OF THAT, THAT REPUBLICANS COULDN'T JUST PUT THE FIGHT DOWN FOR AN HOUR --  NO.  SO DIFFERENT FROM THE WAY SHE AND DEMOCRATS RESPONDED WHEN SCALISE WAS SHOT AND ALMOST KILLED. SHE I THINK WHAT SHE SAID SHE WAS OF COURSE OUTRAGED AND SAID WE ARE ALL ONE FAMILY.  RIGHT.  NOT REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON THIS. WE ARE ALL ONE FAMILY. SHE DID EVERYTHING. SCALISE AT LEAST DID ATTEND --  HALF OF IT.  PART OF IT.  COME ON. I ASK AGAIN AND AGAIN WHO RAISED -- WHO RAISED YOU? MEN AND WOMEN IN THE HOUSE AND THE FAR RIGHT. WOULD YOUR MOTHERS LIKE THE BEHAVIOR TODAY? THIS PARTY COMING TO POLICY. I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE. IT IS NOT EXAMINE RATING CALLING IT THE PARTY OF INHUMANITY. SO SENSE OF EMPATHY OR HUMANITY COMING TO POLICY OR BEHAVIOR. THIS IS A PARTY -- I'M TALKING ABOUT REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE. NOT SOME MEMBERS OF THE SENATE WHO TAKE A DIFFERENT ROUTE LIKE MITCH McCONNELL, PUT OUT A GENEROUS AND APPROPRIATE AND GRACEFUL STATEMENT. THAT'S HOW IT WORKS, GUYS IN THE HOUSE. YOU TEND TO STAY IN THE CRUEL CORNER TO CARRY OUT POLICIES ON ABORTION, WANTING A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL FORCED TO HAVE A BABY OF A RAPIST OR GUNS BUT YOU STAY THERE IN THE CORNER OF CRUELTY. YOUR BEHAVIOR -- I HATE TO SOUND LIKE MOMMY HERE OR SOMETHING BUT THEIR BEHAVIOR IS ABHORRENT AND THEIR BEHAVIOR AFTER PAUL PELOSI WAS ATTACKED? MOCKING. SILENT.  WOMEN PLAY THIS ROLE HISTORICALLY WITH MALE POLITICIANS. PAUL PELOSI IS AMAZING. GOING TO FUNERAL WITH NANCY PELOSI HE IS THERE AND COMING ALONG AS A SUPPORTIVE SPOUSE. HE IS A REALLY GOOD GUY.  YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE HIM TO BE GRACEFUL AND NEED TO BEHAVE YOURSELF AND ASK LIKE A HUMAN BEING.  WHILE ATTACKED IN PART BECAUSE OF YEAR'S WORTH OF UNFETTERED ATTACKS TO NANCY PELOSI AND THE SUPPORTERS LOOKING TO KILL HER.  THE SAME HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO CLEARLY DON'T HAVE A POLITE BONE IN THEIR BODY, A GRACEFUL BONE AND SEEM TO CAPITALIZE ON CRUELTY FOR THE SUCCESS \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" OFFERS THIS ANALYSIS FOR HOW THE REPUBLICANS WILL GOVERN WITH THE NEW RAZOR-THIN HOUSE MAJORITY. WHY? BECAUSE THEY LOST IN A HISTORICALLY EPIC MIDTERM RESULT THAT SHOWS THEIR BEHAVIOR TURNED OFF VOTERS. THE ONLY RESULTS ARE THOSE THAT INFLICT PAIN ON MR. BIDEN AND CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS. AND THE CLOSED DOOR MEETING OF REPUBLICANS ON MONDAY RIGHT WING LAWMAKERS INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE EXTRACTED A PROMISE THAT THEIR LEADERS WOULD INVESTIGATE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI AND THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEFENDANTS JAILED IN CONNECTION WITH THE JANUARY 6 ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL. SO THEY WANT TO DEFEND THE CRIMINALS WHO ATTACKED THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6. HERE'S THE GEORGIA REPUBLICAN YESTERDAY SPEAKING OUT ABOUT HER DEMAND.  I'D ASK THAT STEVE SCALISE AND IF HE WOULD SUPPORT INVESTIGATIONS INTO NANCY PELOSI'S HANDLING OF SECURITY AT THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6. I BELIEVE THAT ONE'S REALLY IMPORTANT. I ALSO IN THAT QUESTION I ASKED HIM ABOUT IF WE CAN -- IF HE WOULD SUPPORT INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE TREATMENT OF PRETRIAL JANUARY 6 DEFENDANTS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT. AND HE SAID THAT HE WOULD SUPPORT IT THROUGH THE COMMITTEES SO THAT EACH COMMITTEES ASSIGNED WOULD BE HANDLING IT. I LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING WITH JAMIE COMER.  I THINK HE ONLY WANTS TO TALK ABOUT HUNTER IS WHAT HE SAID. THIS IS YOUR BEAT. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?  I ASK COMBER AND JIM JORDAN YESTERDAY AND HE -- THEY INITIALLY DODGED THE QUESTION AND JIM JORDAN ADDRESSING IT SAYING WE WANT TO INVESTIGATE THE DOJ GENERALLY SPEAKING AND TRIED TO DRILL DOWN ON PELOSI AND THE JANUARY 6 INSURRECTIONISTS AND PIVOTED TO HUNTER BIDEN. THEY HAVE NOT TALKED TO THE CHAIRMAN ABOUT THIS INVESTIGATION.  JONATHAN CAPEHART, THE CAPITOL ATTACKERS ARE GOING THROUGH THE JUDICIAL PROCESS.  RIGHT.  IS THIS POSSIBLE?  LOOK. WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING HERE IN THAT MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE CLIP IS EVERYTHING KEVIN McCARTHY IS DOING TO GET THE GAVEL. NEGOTIATING TO GET 218 VOTES MAKING THAT OFFICIAL VOTE IN JANUARY. WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF NANCY PELOSI. NANCY PELOSI HAD A CORE, A MORAL CORE. THERE ARE THINGS SHE BELIEVES IN AND WANTS TO -- LEGISLATIVELY WANTS TO DO. WHAT WE ARE SEEING WITH KEVIN McCARTHY, MINORITY LEADER, FOR THE MOMENT IS SOMEONE WHO IS JUST ABOUT THE POWER, GETTING THAT SPEAKER'S GAVEL AND WILL TRADE AWAY PRETTY MUCH ANYTHING TO GET THAT GAVEL. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER REPUBLICANS RUNNING ON CRIME, INFLATION, THE ECONOMY IS FALLING TO PIECES AND INSTEAD WE GOT THAT.  WHAT I'M CONFUSED ABOUT IS I THOUGHT THE MIDTERMS TAUGHT THE REPUBLICANS THAT -- I'LL SAY IT SLOWLY FOR YOU IN THE HOUSE. SPEAK REALLY SLOWLY. MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY WHAT IS BEING SAID HERE. IT APPEARS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T LIKE INSURRECTIONS. WHAT'S AN INSURRECTIONS? WHAT HAPPENED AT THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6th. WHEN THE PEOPLE WERE LISTENING TO PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO TOLD THEM TO RUSH THE CAPITOL, TO GO GET 'EM, BRING THAT NOOSE AND EVERYTHING ELSE THEY BROUGHT. THE ZIP TIES. REMEMBER THE ZIP TIES? REMEMBER THE POOH POOH OR WHATEVER IT IS THEY DID ALL OVER THE CAPITOL? BREAKING THE WINDOWS? THAT WAS BAD. THAT WAS NOT GOOD. REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE WHO SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE TRUTH, WITH RIGHT AND WRONG, WITH WHAT GRACE LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT OUR CONSTITUTION STANDS FOR. AND WHAT YOUR JOB IS. OKAY? SO I'M SPEAKING SLOWLY HERE SO YOU UNDERSTAND. PEOPLE LIKE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN PLACES LIKE UKRAINE. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GET YOU A MAP? WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO EXPLAIN NATO TO YOU? DO YOU NEED SOME HELP? HE CAN HELP YOU OUT HERE. MY BIGGER POINT IS, CHRIS MATTHEWS, I SPEAK SLOWLY BECAUSE SOME OF THEM SEEM FAIRLY IGNORANT AS TO WHAT THE MIDTERMS TOLD REPUBLICANS ABOUT WHAT AMERICANS CARED ABOUT. AND WHAT THEIR JOB IS. WHAT DID WE LEARN?  BIG PICTURE IS THAT AMERICANS DON'T LIKE THE DEMOCRACY BEING MOCKED. THE GREATEST THING WE HAVE IS ELECTORAL POWER AND THE FREEDOM TO EXERCISE THOSE VOTES AND WHAT WE GET FROM THE VOTES. THE ABILITY TO CONTROL POLITICIANS, TO RULE THE COUNTRY. ON ELECTION DAY THAT'S ONE DAY THE VOTERS RULE. THEY CAN GIVE IT BACK TO WHOEVER THEY WANT TO. THEY DIDN'T RESPECT THE POWER. IN A PHYSICAL SENSE IF YOU'RE A CAPITOL PERSON, A CONGRESSMEN OR A STAFFER, YOU KNOW THE POLICE DEFENDED YOUR LIFE AND MIKE PENCE'S LIFE. LIFE. AGAINST HIS PRESIDENT. THOSE GUYS COME AND BREAK THE DOOR MAY HAVE LOOKED LIKE PEOPLE THAT THE COPS KNEW OR VOTED LIKE THE WAY THE COPS DID, SOME OF THEM. THEY WERE THERE TO BREAK THE LAW AND HURT THE COUNTRY AND GAVE THEIR LIVES. HOW YOU CANNOT ROOT FOR EVERY COP AND LEARN THE NAMES AND SAY HELLO TO THEM IN THE MORNING AND THANK THEM I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. THAT IS REALLY HUMAN. BEYOND POLITICS. IT IS UNBELIEVERIBLE TO ROOT FOR THE MOB.  IS THIS LOST ON YOU WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE OR A STRATEGY THAT YOU -- FROM THE YEARS OF COVERING POLITICS CAN IDENTIFY?  I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD POLICY LIKE JONATHAN WENT THROUGH THE RENDITION OF WHAT A REPUBLICAN THINKS LIKE. THEY DON'T LIKE BIG DEFICITS. THEY -- LONG BEFORE TRUMP AND POSSIBLY AFTER TRUMP BUT RIGHT NOW CULTISTS. THEY ARE LIKE SOME OF A STRANGE RELIGION THEY BELIEVE IN ONE PERSON TELLING THEM THAT THE ELECTION IS CROOKED AND AS LONG AS HE SAYS THAT THEY WILL ECHO THAT. THEY WILL DITTO THAT. LIKE IN RUSH LIMBAUGH DAYS. BECAUSE OF A STRANGE CHEMICAL POWER HE HAS OVER THEM. IT IS FRIGHTENING.  THANK YOU FOR BEING ON. WE'LL WATCH THE SUNDAY SHOW ON MSNBC. WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU.

THE SENATE ADVANCING A BILL THAT CODIFIES PROTECTION FOR SAME SEX MARRIAGE, AND IT WAS A BIPARTISAN PRETTY OVERWHELMING VOTE BY TODAY'S STANDARD, BREAKING AN ATTEMPT AT A REPUBLICAN FILIBUSTER. WHY? BECAUSE IN ADDITION TOT DEMOCRATS A DOZEN REPUBLICANS CAME OVER TO DO IT. INDEED, JUSTICE THOMAS HAD AN OPINION WHEN THIS FIRST CAME DOWN SAID AFTER LOOKING AT THE ABORTION ISSUE WE SHOULD REKL ALL COURT'S PRECEDENTS INCLUDING THE MARRIAGE RULING. THOMAS SAID THOSE WERE ERRORS, AND QUOTE, WE HAVE A DUTY TO CORRECT THE ERROR. MANY ON THE RIGHT AGREE.  LIKE ROE VS. WADE IGNORED TWO CENTURIES OF OUR NATION'S HISTORY. MARRIAGE WAS ALWAYS AN ISSUE THAT WAS LEFT TO THE STATE. I THINK THAT DECISION WAS CLEARLY WRONG WHEN IT WAS DECIDED. IT WAS THE COURT OVERREACHING.  THAT'S WHAT THE TED CRUZ JUSTICE THOMAS AXES LOOKS LIKE. BUT KEEP IN MIND WHAT'S STRIKING THAT'S SO DIFFERENT 10 OR 15 YEARS AGO IS HOW THERE'S AN OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN COALITION IN THE SENATE TO GET THIS DONE. DEMOCRATS CONTROL THE HOUSE, BUT THAT'S JUST CATCHING UP WITH PUBLIC OPINION. THE SUPPORT MORE MARRIAGE EQUALITY, WHICH WAS QUITE LOW IN THE 90s HAS ONLY BEEN UPWARD TILT.

        "trs": "> OUT RAGE TODAY FROM VIRGINIA EDUCATORS AND DEMOCRATS OVER WHAT THEY ARE CALLING POLITICALLY MOTIVATED CHANGES TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM PROPOSED THIS WEEK BY GOVERNOR GLEN YOUNGKIN'S NEW SCHOOL BOARD. JUST ONE OF THEIR PROPOSALS, ACCORDING TO REPORTING IN \"THE WASHINGTON POST,\" INCLUDED REMOVING MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. FROM HOLIDAYS THAT STUDENTS IN KINDERGARTEN SHOULD LEARN ABOUT. AFTER LOTS OF CRITICISM IT APPEARS THEY HAVE ADDED THAT BACK IN. BUT HERE'S ONE THEY'RE YET TO REVERSE FROM \"THE WASHINGTON POST,\" THE NEW GUIDE LINES DELETE A SUGGESTION FROM THE PREVIOUS VERSION THAT KINDERGARTENERS BE TAUGHT RESPECT FOR DIVERSITY BY LEARNING HOW TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH PEOPLE OF DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS, VIEWPOINTS AND EXPERIENCES. JOINING OUR CONVERSATION IS HEIDI PRZYBYLA. WE MISS HER FROM WHEN SHE WAS HERE. SHE'S REPORTED ON HOW STATE LEGISLATURES HAVE CHANGED WHAT CAN BE TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS. DONNA AND ALICIA ARE STILL HERE. TALK ME INSIDE WHAT'S HAPPENING NOT JUST IN VIRGINIA BUT WHERE CONSERVATIVES ARE TRYING TO REACH INTO CURRICULUM.  YEAH. NICOLE, THIS IS HAPPENING IN A NUMBER OF RED STATES BUT IT REALLY DID START HERE IN VIRGINIA WHEN GLEN YOUNGKIN WAS ELECTED ON THE NOTION THAT CRITICAL RACE THEORY WAS BEING TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS. IT IS SEEN BY MANY IN THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT, PARTICULARLY AS THE ENTHUSIASM WAINS ON ABORTION. BUT THERE'S ONE PROBLEM, THEY COULD NEVER DEFINE IT. I DID MANY INTERVIEWS WITH VIRGINIA VOTERS WHO COULDN'T EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS. WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE IS AN ATTEMPT, NICOLE, AT USING SOMETHING THAT COULD BE A TEMPLATE AGAIN IN OTHER STATES AS WELL TO MAKE GOOD ON THAT PROMISE OF BANNING SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T FIND ANY EVIDENCE THAT EXISTS. IT'S NOTABLE FOR MANY REASONS. I THINK IT'S A LIVING DOCUMENT, IT'S GOING TO GET A LOT OF PUSHBACK, THERE'S GOING TO BE CHANGES TO IT. BUT IT'S STRIKING HOW IT ERASES THE ROLE OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. ERASING, I GUESS THEY REVERSED IT NOW, MLK DAY, THERE WAS JUNETEENTH CHANGING INDIGENOUS PEOPLE'S DAY BACK TO COLUMBUS DAY. IT APPEARS TO HAVE A EURO CENTRAL FOCUS. I SAW AT ONE POINT, FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE, ABOUT LEARNING ABOUT CONTINENTS OTHER THAN EUROPE --  WHAT?  AND THEN JUST THE ISSUE OF NOT TALKING ABOUT RACISM. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU TEACH ABOUT OUR HISTORY OF SLAVERY, JIM CROW, AND SEGREGATION WITHOUT MENTIONING RACISM. MY CONCERN AS A PARENT IN THIS STATE AND A REPORTER, IS WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES, WHAT ARE THE REPERCUSSIONS GOING TO BE FOR TEACHERS IN THIS STATE AND OTHER STATES IT'S HAPPENING. WE HAD A HOT LINE SET UP HERE THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE RIGHT AFTER THE CAMPAIGN TO RAT ON TEACHERS THAT PARENTS FELT WERE VIOLATING CRITICAL RACE THEORY NON-TEACHING RULES.  HEIDI, JUST FINISH THIS SENTENCE FOR ME. THE GOAL OF NOT TEACHING STUDENTS ALL THE CONTINENTS IS WHAT?  LOOK, I'M JUST READING THIS MYSELF. AND I DON'T -- I DON'T WANT TO MAKE A SWEEPING STATEMENT THAT THEY WOULDN'T LEARN ABOUT THE OTHER CONTINENTS BUT THEY WOULD HAVE A EURO CENTRIC -- THAT'S WHAT I TOOK AWAY FROM READING THE ARTICLE. I'M NOT THE ORIGINAL REPORTER ON IT. BUT IT SEEMED THERE'S AN EMPHASIS ON EUROPEAN CULTURE THAN SOME OF THE OTHER CONTINENTS WHICH FITS INTO THIS BROADER NARRATIVE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS TO KIND OF TAKEAWAY SOME OF THE DIVERSITY THAT IS NOT, I DON'T KNOW, EUROPEAN CENTRIC. OR ANYTHING WHEN IT COMES TO RACISM THAT DOESN'T FRANKLY MAKE AMERICA AND AMERICAN HISTORY LOOK VIRTUOUS. NOT TEACHING ABOUT KOE LOANISM, NOT USING WORDS LIKE IMPERILISM, AND RACISM. WHEN THESE THINGS WIND UP BEING USED AS MODELS IN THE ORIGINAL STATE AND VIRGINIA IS REALLY THE ORIGINAL STATE WHEN IT COMES TO GROUND ZERO AND CAMPAIGNING THIS ISSUE OF CRITICAL RACE THEORY.  DONNA, I REMEMBER FROM HEIDI'S REPORTING AND MANY OTHERS THAT IT WAS PROVEN THAT THERE WAS NO CRITICAL RACE THEORY BEING TAUGHT IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN VIRGINIA. SO THIS IS ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. AND I WONDER WHAT YOUR THEORY IS ON WHAT THAT SOMETHING ELSE IS. I THINK THERE HAS BEEN AN AGGRESSIVE PUSHBACK AGAINST, YOU KNOW, A NATION THAT IS INCREASINGLY DIVERSE. YOU LOOK AT A STATE LIKE VIRGINIA. PARTICULARLY IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA WHERE YOU HAVE SCHOOLS WHERE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF HUNDRED LANGUAGES THAT ARE SPOKEN IN HOMES IN THESE SCHOOL SYSTEMS. AND YOU SEE REPUBLICANS IN PARTICULAR RUNNING MORE CANDIDATES FOR SCHOOL BOARD POSITIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO THAT THEY CAN BEGIN TO REDIRECT THE CURRICULUM. AND I THINK IT IS A DIRECT PUSH BACK AGAINST THE CHANGING FACE OF THE NATION WHICH IS INCREASINGLY DIVERSE, MORE BLACK, MORE BROWN, MORE INCLUSIVE. AND YOU HAVE A SET OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GO BACK TO THE GOOD OLD DAYS WHERE MY FAMILIES WERE NOT INCORPORATED INTO THE HISTORY THAT WAS TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS. AND I THINK IT IS A WAKE UP CALL BECAUSE THIS STARTS AT THE LOWER LEVEL IN THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL BOARDS AND SCHOOL SYSTEMS, AND THEN IT MOVES TO THE STATE AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW IT'S A MOVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  I JUST INTERVIEWED WHOOPI GOLDBERG ABOUT HER NEW MOVIE \"TILL\". ABOUT EMMETT TILL. SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO HAVE THAT MOVIE MADE SINCE I'VE KNOWN HER, ABOUT NINE, TEN YEARS. I SAID WHY. SHE SAID, THERE'S SUCH AN EFFORT TO ERASE OUR HISTORY IF YOU DIDN'T PUT IT OUT IN OTHER WAYS, IN ART, CULTURAL, FILM, BOOKS, IT COULD BE LOST.  EXACTLY. I WANT TO UNDERLINE WHAT YOU AND OTHERS HAVE SAID. THIS QUESTION OF CRITICAL RACE THEORY IN 2021, THE VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SAID CRITICAL RACE THEORY IS NOT PART OF THE -- THEY ARE TRYING TO SOLVE FOR A PROBLEM THAT DOES NOT EXIST AND IN DOING SO THEY ARE CREATING A NEW PROBLEM. YOU THEN HAD THE VIRGINIA EDUCATION ASSOCIATION, THAT'S THE UNION THAT REPRESENTS 40,000 EDUCATORS IN THE STATE OF VIRGINIA SAYING WE'RE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THIS. WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT IT FOR THE REASONS THAT HEIDI LAID OUT, WHICH IS OUR JOB IS ACCURACY. OUR JOB IS MAKING SURE OUR STUDENTS HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR HISTORY.  THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENED.  AS IT ACTUALLY HAPPENED SO THEY ARE NOT WANT TO REPEAT IT. SO THE POSITION THIS IS PUTTING EDUCATORS IN IS REALLY, I THINK, STILL THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTION MARKS AROUND WHERE IT GOES FROM HERE BECAUSE IT IS MAKING IT HARDER FOR THEM TO DO THEIR JOB AND MAKING IT HARDER FOR OUR KIDS TO HAVE A FULL UNDERSTANDING EDUCATION THAT THEY NEED AND DESERVE.  IT'S AN AMAZING THING TO SEE GLEN YOUNGKIN WHO RODE THIS, IN COMPLETE CONTRADICTION WITH WHAT THE VIRGINIA EDUCATORS SAY IS HAPPENING THERE. IT'S AMAZING TO SEE HIM TRY TO GRAB IT BACK AS DeSANTIS IS ASCENDING.  THIS IS WHAT YOU AND I KEEP TALKING ABOUT. IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT TRUMP AND TRUMPISM IS OVER BECAUSE THEY HAVE CAUGHT ONTO THE FACT THAT HE MAY NOT BE THE WINNER HE IS SUGGESTING HE IS. BUT IT IS ALIVE IN FOLKS LIKE YOUNGKIN AND DeSANTIS WITHIN THE PARTY. IT'S IN EVERY FORM, THE DON'T SAY GAY BILL IN FLORIDA, THAT YOU HAVE DeSANTIS PUTTING MIGRANTS ON PLANES. AND HAVING A POLICE FORCE --.  IT'S LIKE COMPETENT TRUMPISM, SEEMS LIKE AN OXYMORON. NO ONE IS GOING ANYWHERE. IT'S NOT JUST VIRGINIA. IT'S NOT JUST A PROPOSAL. HOW A CONSERVATIVE SCHOOL BOARD HAS TAKEN OVER SOUTH CAROLINA EDUCATION BANNING BOOKS AND FIRING THE STATE'S FIRST BLACK SUPERINTENDENT. THAT REALLY HAPPENED. WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT. DENT THAT REALLY HAPPENED WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT. 20221117214910.112|20221117214925.177",

I'M GOING TO WIN THE ELECTION AND I WILL ACCEPT THAT RESULT.  SOMETHING HAPPENS WHEN YOU BECOME INDISCERNIBLE FROM YOUR \"SNL\" CHARACTER, WHICH SHE HAS. WE ALL SAW IT A MILE AWAY. PREDICTABLE. FRANKLY, PATHETIC, WHEN YOUR CANDIDACY FOR POLITICAL OFFICE IS PREDICATED ON DENYING THE RESULTS OF A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION, WHICH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THIS WAS ANYTHING BUT. AND THEN YOUR CANDIDACY SUBSEQUENTLY FAILS, ONE CAN RIGHTLY EXPECT A CHALLENGE OF THE RESULTS. THAT'S WHY TODAY THE NATION ROLLED ITS EYES AT KARI LAKE. SHE IS THE PROJECTED LOSER OF THE ARIZONA GOVERNOR'S RACE. TRUE TO FORM, SHE IS REFUSING TO CONCEDE, ALLEGING IMPROPER ELECTION DAY SOMETHING. IN THE VIDEO THIS MORNING, LAKE SHARED A SINGLE ANECDOTE ABOUT LONG LINES AT POLLING PLACE, A POLLING PLACE. AND SHE IS PUTTING TOGETHER, QUOTE, THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST LEGAL TEAM TO EXPLORE WAYS TO, QUOTE, CORRECT THE MANY WRONGS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE THIS WEEK. WE'RE BACK WITH MILES, KATTY AND AMY. MILES, KARI LAKE IS NOW LESS DEMOCRATIC, MORE AUTHORITARIAN THAN DOUG MASTRIANO, WHICH IS SOMETHING I WOULD EVER UTTER. BUT THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. MASTRIANO HAS CONCEDED HIS GUBERNATORIAL EFFORT AGAINST JOSH SHAPIRO. I THINK IT TOOK HIM FIVE DAYS. WHAT DOES -- WHAT HAPPENS IN ARIZONA, A PLACE WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF BIG LIE ACTIVITY?  I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS, NICOLLE. KARI LAKE IS KIND OF LIKE A VOODOO DOLL AND POLLSTERING DOLL HAD A BABY. SHE'LL SAY THE SAME TRUMP LINES WE'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER LIKE WE HEARD WITH THAT REPORTER. I DO WORRY SHE IS GOING TO BE THE ONE WHO TAKES THIS ELECTION DENIALISM INTO THE NEXT GENERATION AND GIVING IT NEW LIFE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE WORRIED ABOUT IN THE LEAD-UP TO THESE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, THAT WE WOULD HAVE PEOPLE WHO CONTEST THEIR RESULTS, EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO NEED TO CONTEST THEM IF THEY'VE LOST FAIR AND SQUARE. IT SEEMS LIKE KARI LAKE IS REALLY POISED TO DO THAT. AND I THINK THAT GIVES A LOT OF CONCERN BECAUSE ARIZONA IS A TINDERBOX RIGHT NOW. I'M IN ARIZONA AT THE MOMENT FOR RELATED POLITICAL EFFORTS, AND THERE IS A LOT OF TENSION HERE IN THE AIR IN THE STATE BECAUSE OF HER COMMENTS AND WORDS. AND OF COURSE, NICOLLE, IT'S NOT JUST KARI LAKE. WE'VE GOT SOME OF THESE OTHER ELECTIONS WE'RE WATCHING WHERE OTHERS COULD FOLLOW SUIT. RIGHT NOW LAUREN BOEBERT I THINK IS ONLY 600 VOTES AHEAD OF FRISCH. BUT IF THOSE NUMBERS CHANGED, THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER PERSON WE SEE THE KARI LAKE LINE SPOUTED FROM. SO THIS ISN'T OVER YET. AND WE CAN ONLY HOPE THAT PEOPLE DO CONCEDE LIKE TIM RYAN DID VERY GRACIOUSLY IN OHIO.  YOU KNOW, THERE IS THIS FEELING THAT WE DONNELLED A POLITICAL BULLET, RIGHT, THAT LAST TUESDAY CAME AND WENT, AND THAT THE PEOPLE THAT HAVEN'T CONCEDED THEIR DEFEATS ARE THE OUTLIERS. BUT THEN YOU THINK JANUARY 6th TOOK TWO MONTHS TO BREW. IT BUILT AND IT BUILT AND THEN IT HAPPENED. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?  AS MILES SAID, I'M WATCHING ARIZONA TOO, BECAUSE THAT DID BECOME GROUND ZERO OF THE ELECTION DENIALISM. AND KARI LAKE'S WHOLE CAMPAIGN, WHOLE POLITICAL CAREER REALLY IS BASED ON DENYING THE RESULTS OF THE 2020 ELECTION. I DON'T SEE WHERE SHE GOES.  RIGHT.  HER ONLY OPTION NOW IS TO CARRY ON FIGHTING THAT BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T -- I SPENT TIME WITH HER WHEN I WAS IN ARIZONA. SHE TALKED ABOUT THE WALL AND SHE TALKED ABOUT ABORTION. BUT WHEN I SAW HER OUT TRYING TO WIN VOTERS AT A CAMPAIGN EVENT WITH A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY, REALLY I'D SAY 70% OF HER MESSAGE WAS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN. WHEN I INTERVIEW HER AFTERWARDS, SHE COULDN'T FIND THE EVIDENCE. IT'S LIKE THROWING JELLY AT A WALL. IT'S INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE NEVER COME.  RIGHT.  BUT THE PROMISE --  THE PLATITUDES.  RIGHT. SHE HAS ONE LINE. AND SHE IS INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE. SHE IS ACTUALLY A VERY EFFECTIVE CAMPAIGNER. SHE WALKED INTO THIS ROOM OF RETIREES IN ARIZONA AND SHE HAD THEM EATING OUT OF THE PALM OF HER HAND. THEY KNEW HER FROM TELEVISION. SHE WAS VERY POISED. I WAS THE ONLY JOURNALIST THERE AND SHE DIDN'T LOVE THAT AND KEPT CALLING ME OUT. I DO WORRY ABOUT ARIZONA. MARK FINCHEM ALSO HASN'T CONCEDED. WHAT HAPPENS IF MARK FINCHEM AND KARI LAKE DON'T. THEY HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO SUPPORTED THEM IN THE STATE. WHAT DO THEY DO WITH THAT SUPPORT.  THIS IS SORT OF THAT UNCOMFORTABLE TENSION BETWEEN DEMOCRACY HAVING A VERY GOOD DAY LAST WEEK, AMERICANS NOT WANTING TO GO ALONG WITH THIS LURCH TOWARD AUTHORITARIAN PRACTICES. BUT FEELING LIKE THERE IS STILL A WHOLE LOT OF ANGST AND A WHOLE LOT OF WORK THE BE DONE.  ABSOLUTELY. WE WON THE BATTLE. WE DIDN'T WIN THE WAR. THESE ELECT DENIERS AREN'T GOING AWAY WITH ONE ELECTION. AND, YOU KNOW FOR, THOSE OF US THAT LOVE OUR DEMOCRACY, WHETHER YOU ARE INDEPENDENT OR REPUBLICAN LIKE MILES OR USED TO BE, OR A DEMOCRAT LIKE MYSELF, YOU KNOW, WE CARE ABOUT THIS COUNTRY, AND WE HAVE TO KEEP FIGHTING. I THINK THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. AND THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS NOT JUST THESE ELECTION DENIERS, BUT WHAT HAS BEEN PROVEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT THE MAINSTREAM REPUBLICAN PARTY LEADERSHIP IS WILLING TO GO ALONG WITH THIS.  WORSE, THEY ENABLE IT, RIGHT?  ENABLE IT OR ARE SILENT. I RAN AGAINST SOME OF THESE GUYS. I RAN THEM POUR THE HOUSE RACE AGAINST A GUY WHO IS JUST AS SILENT ABOUT IT.  MIKE PENCE CAMPAIGNED WITH DON BOLDUC. EVEN THOUGH HE STOOD UP ON JANUARY 6th AND DID WHAT WAS RIGHT BY THE CONSTITUTION, IT DIDN'T STOP HIM FROM GOING OUT AND CAMPAIGNING WITH ELECTION DENIERS.  INCREDIBLE. WELL, THIS CONVERSATION IS TO BE CONTINUED AS WELL. MILES TELLER, THANK YOU FOR SPENDING TIME WITH US. KATTY AND AMY, WE'LL BE BACK IN THE HOUR. > WHEN WE COME BACK, PROTESTS IN IRAN GROWING IN INTENSITY AND VIOLENCE. OUR NEXT GUEST SAYS IT COULD BE THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC.

IT HELPED TO SET THE STAGE IN PART FOR THE PARTY'S BIG WINS NATIONWIDE IN LAST WEEK'S MIDTERMS. JOINING US NOW, DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN SHARICE DAVIDS OF CONGRESS WHO WON REELECTION HERSELF. CONGRESSWOMAN, GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON THIS MORNING. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WIN AGAIN HERE. I NOTICED IN 2018, YOU FLIPPED YOUR SEAT, WHICH HAD BEEN A REPUBLICAN SEAT TO THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. YOU WIN IN 2020, AND THEN THIS TIME IN 2022, YOU WIN BY AN EVEN WIDER MARGIN THAN YOU WON IN 2020. SO WALK US THROUGH, IF YOU COULD, WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR DISTRICT AND IN THE STATE OF KANSAS.  IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE, AND I LIKE THE TIME LINE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN KANSAS AND CERTAINLY IN THE KANSAS THIRD, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT WE SAW BOTH IN AUGUST AND AGAIN IN NOVEMBER ON ELECTION NIGHT WAS THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZED THAT OUR RIGHTS WERE ON THE BALLOT IN AUGUST, AND AGAIN IN NOVEMBER. AND THAT ALSO, YOU KNOW, IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE WANT A REPRESENTATIVE WHO'S GOING TO SHOW UP, WHO'S GOING TO SHOW UP TO DO THE WORK, WHO'S GOING TO SHOW UP TO LISTEN, TO BEST REPRESENT THE DISTRICT, AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO OVER MY TIME SERVING THE KANSAS THIRD.  AND CONGRESSWOMAN, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF FOCUS PUT AS I MENTIONED AT THE TOP ON THAT BALLOT INITIATIVE OVER THE SUMMER ON ABORTION IN THE STATE OF KANSAS. PEOPLE LOOK AT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, WELL, KANSAS IS A RED STATE, DONALD TRUMP WON BY 15 POINTS IN 2020, AND I THINK THAT'S PERHAPS WHY NATIONALLY AT LEAST THERE WAS SOME SURPRISE AT THAT NUMBER. HOW BIG OF A MOTIVATING FACTOR DO YOU THINK THAT WAS TO VOTERS IN YOUR ELECTION?  WELL, AGAIN, I DO THINK THAT PEOPLE WERE -- IF YOU THINK BACK TO JUNE WHEN ROE WAS OVERTURNED, THE IMPACT WAS IMMEDIATE. PEOPLE FELT IT VISCERALLY. I MEAN, THE FEAR, THE ANXIETY. IN KANSAS, WE WERE WATCHING NEIGHBORING STATES ENACT VERY EXTREME LAWS, AND WE KNEW THAT WE DIDN'T WANT POLITICIANS MAKING VERY PRIVATE HEALTH CARE DECISIONS FOR US, PARTICULARLY AROUND ABORTION OR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. AND SO I THINK THAT PEOPLE WERE -- WE WERE GETTING ORGANIZED ALREADY, AND CERTAINLY THAT CONTINUED THROUGH AFTER THE AUGUST, YOU KNOW, AFTER WE WERE ABLE TO PUSH BACK ON THIS EXTREME -- THESE EXTREME POLICIES, AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE ABSOLUTELY CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS AND THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE THEIR KIDS AND GRAND KIDS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH IS WHY IT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT, YOU KNOW, I AM ALWAYS OUT THERE LISTENING AND TALKING ABOUT AND WORKING ON CONCRETE SOLUTIONS TO THE ISSUES THAT ARE MOST PRESSING.  CONGRESSWOMAN, SAM STEIN HERE, WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE BALLOT INITIATIVE, ONE OF THE THINGS WAS IN ECHO OF WHAT YOU SAID, THEY HAD TO SHOW UP IN THE COMMUNITIES TO TALK TO PEOPLE FACE TO FACE TO EXPLAIN SORT OF THE STAKES OF WHAT WAS GOING ON, IN ADDITION TO THE SORT OF TRICKY TO UNDERSTAND LANGUAGE OF THE INITIATIVE. YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE LIKE JOHN FETTERMAN, HE SHOWED UP IN THE RED AREAS OF THE STATE, AND HELPED BUFFER THE MARGINS OF DEMOCRATS IN THE AREAS. I'M WONDERING IF YOU TAKE STOCK OF WHAT HAPPENED, DO YOU THINK DEMOCRATS DO A GOOD JOB SHOWING UP TO TRADITIONALLY REPUBLICAN CONSERVATIVE OR RURAL AREAS, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE PARTY DO DIFFERENTLY IN GOING FORWARD. WHAT WOULD THE MESSAGE BE FOR PARTY LEADERS ABOUT INVESTMENTS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES?  LOOK, I'M ALWAYS GOING TO ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT IN KANSAS, AND IN THE KANSAS THIRD, SO I DO THINK THAT THAT -- I DO THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT THING TO BE THINKING ABOUT, BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT OTHER FOLKS IN OTHER STATES OR DISTRICTS SHOULD BE DOING, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT, BUT I CAN SAY THAT I SHOW UP IN EVERY PART OF THE DISTRICT. YOU MENTIONED THAT WITH SOME OTHER FOLKS, SENATOR ELECT FETTERMAN CERTAINLY, BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ANYBODY WHO IS ON THE BALLOT. DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN, INDEPENDENT, IF YOU WANT TO REPRESENT PEOPLE, YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY LISTEN TO PEOPLE, AND SHOW UP. I SHOW UP IN EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE DISTRICT. I AM ALWAYS THERE TO LISTEN. I THINK PEOPLE APPRECIATE WHEN YOU SHOW UP AND YOU DON'T ALREADY ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH. I ALSO MAKE SURE THAT I SHOW UP, LISTEN, AND THEN DELIVER WHEN I GET THE CHANCE OUT HERE, WHETHER IT'S, YOU KNOW, AN UPCOMING FARM BILL WHICH I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING ON OR THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT WE GOT TO WORK ON. PEOPLE WANT YOU TO LISTEN AND DELIVER, AND THAT'S WHAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO FOR THE KANSAS THIRD.  CONGRESSWOMAN ASHLEY PARKER OF THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" IS HERE WITH A QUESTION FOR YOU, ASHLEY.  THANK YOU, CONGRESSWOMAN. I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON SOMETHING WILLIE ASKED YOU. OBVIOUSLY ABORTION WAS A BIG ISSUE IN YOUR MOST RECENT RACE AND THE RACES OF A LOT OF DEMOCRATS. I'M CURIOUS, DO YOU THINK ABORTION HAS THE POTENTIAL AND THOSE RIGHTS BEING TAKEN AWAY TO BECOME FOR DEMOCRATS WHAT IT WAS FOR REPUBLICANS? YOU KNOW, FOR A NUMBER OF DECADES, AT LEAST UNTIL MAYBE CONGRESS CODIFIES ROE. I GUESS MY QUESTION WAS WAS IT JUST A BIG ISSUE BECAUSE THE DOBBS DECISION HAS COME DOWN OR COULD THIS BE GALVANIZING FOR GENERATIONS TO COME?  WOW, THAT'S A -- THAT'S MAYBE SOMETHING THAT'S BEST LEFT TO POLITICAL SCIENTISTS AND THAT SORT OF THING. I CAN TELL YOU THAT I THINK THAT PROTECTING OUR RIGHTS AND KNOWING THAT, YOU KNOW, I THINK THE KANSAS THIRD WANTED A REPRESENTATIVE WHO IS ALWAYS GOING TO PUSH BACK AGAINST NOT JUST EXTREME POLICIES OR ANY ATTEMPTS TO HAVE POLITICIANS MAKING THESE VERY PERSONAL, PRIVATE DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY AROUND ACCESS TO ABORTION. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT SO LONG AS YOU HAVE POLITICIANS OUT THERE WHO ARE EITHER RUNNING FOR OFFICE OR ARE ALREADY ELECTED WHO ARE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY RIGHTS THAT WE CONSIDER TO BE FOUNDATIONAL, I THINK THAT THESE ISSUES WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT ON EVERY SINGLE -- ON EVERY SINGLE BALLOT, AND EVERY SINGLE ELECTION, AND MY HOPE IS THAT FOLKS WHO ARE CURRENTLY REPRESENTING DISTRICTS OR ARE SEEKING TO IN THE FUTURE RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE DO NOT WANT THEIR KIDS TO HAVE LESS RIGHTS THAN THEY HAVE. AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR FROM THIS ELECTION CYCLE, I THINK.  DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN SHARICE DAVIDS OF KANSAS WHO WON BY 12 POINTS LAST WEEK IN A DISTRICT THAT JUST FOUR YEARS AGO WAS RED. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY, CONGRESSWOMAN, WE APPRECIATE IT.  THANK YOU. > AND ASHLEY PARKER, THANK YOU AS WELL. ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON. COME BACK SOON. > UP NEXT, LEGISLATION TO PROTECT SAME-SEX MARRIAGE HAS PASSED A CRUCIAL STEP IN THE SENATE WITH A DOZEN REPUBLICANS GETTING ON BOARD. WE'LL SPEAK WITH SENATE MAJORITY WHIP DICK DURBIN ABOUT WHEN THAT BILL WILL COME UP FOR A FINAL VOTE. > PLUS, WE ARE COMING UP ON THE START OF WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A VERY BUSY TRAVEL SEASON, GETTING BACK TO PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS. WE'LL TALK TO THE TSA ABOUT WHAT THAT ORGANIZATION IS DOING TO GET PEOPLE THROUGH LONG SECURITY LINES AT AIRPORTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SECURITY LINES AT AIRPORTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 20221117124156.162|20221117124603.126",

        "trs": "> THE LOW ENERGY SPEECH WASN'T RECEIVED WELL BY THE PEOPLE WATCHING LIVE IN THE ROOM. ACCORDING TO ABC SOME AUDIENCE MEMBERS TRIED TO LEAVE EARLY BUT STOPPED BY SECURITY. HAVE A LOOK.  I SAW PEOPLE TRYING TO LEAVE PERHAPS CONCERNED THAT THE HALL WOULD EMPTY OUT TOO MUCH AND STARTED TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM LEAVING. AND PEOPLE LEAVING EARLY BEFORE HE WAS DONE.  STRANGE THOSE PEOPLE DIDN'T MAKE IT THROUGH BECAUSE TRUMP SUPPORTERS NEVER LET THINGS LIKE DOORS OR SECURITY STOP THEM BEFORE.  WELCOME BACK TO \"MORNING JOE.\" IT IS THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 17th. THE THIRD HOUR OF \"MORNING JOE.\" DONALD TRUMP'S THIRD PRESIDENTIAL BID IS SETTING OFF A NEW ROUND OF REPUBLICAN INFIGHTING AS TRUMP ALLIES SQUARE OFF AGAINST A GROWING CHORUS OF LAWMAKERS, DONORS AND FORMER TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS SAYING THE GOP NEEDS TO CHANGE COURSE IN 2024. NBC NEWS SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT GARRETT HEADACHE HAS THE LATEST.  Reporter: WITH THE SPEAKER'S GAVEL POISED TO PASS TO McCARTHY REPUBLICANS VOW TO RAMP UP INVESTIGATIONS AND THE PRESIDENT'S SON HUNTER'S BUSINESS DEALINGS. THE SHIFT IN THE BALANCE OF POWER FROM ABORTION TO CLIMATE TO GUN REFORM. EVEN AS REPUBLICANS CELEBRATE THE VICTORY THEY CONFRONT DEEP DIVISIONS. WITH SOME ALLIES SAYING THEY'RE ON BOARD.  I LIKE HIS POLICIES AND HOW TOUGH HE IS.  Reporter: REPUBLICANS SAY IT IS TIME FOR THE PARTY TO MOVE ON.  WE NEED A FUTURE LEANING PARTY.  Reporter: ECHOED BY FORMER ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS.  UNFIT FOR OFFICE.  Reporter: REPUBLICAN MEGA DONOR STEVEN SCHWARTZMAN SAID IT IS TIME FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO TURN TO A NEW GENERATION OF LEADERS. THE LEADING POTENTIAL RIVAL FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS IS DISMISSING TALK ABOUT A REPUBLICAN CIVIL WAR.  PEOPLE NEED TO CHILL OUT A LITTLE BIT. SERIOUSLY.  Reporter: CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS AVOID THE QUESTION. MITCH McCONNELL STEERING CLEAR.  THE WAY I GO INTO THIS PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY SEASON IS TO STAY OUT OF IT. I DON'T HAVE A DOG IN THAT FIGHT.  Reporter: HE HAS WON ANOTHER FIGHT FENDING OFF A CHALLENGE FROM TRUMP ALLY RICK SCOTT WHO SOUGHT TO OUST HIM AFTER THE FAILURE TO WIN CONTROL OF THE SENATE.  THAT'S NBC'S GARRET HAAKE WITH A REPORT. SO FASCINATING THAT YOU HAVE RICK SCOTT COMING OFF THIS DISASTROUS PERFORMANCE RUNNING THE REPUBLICAN SENATE COMMITTEE ARM AND THEN DECIDES TO RUN FOR MAJORITY LEADER. THAT WOULD BE LIKE -- I DON'T KNOW -- WORKING IN PRIVATE BUSINESS RUNNING A HOSPITAL CHAIN AND RACKING UP THE LARGEST EVER MEDICARE FRAUD FINE FOR ANY HOSPITAL CHAIN IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICA AND THEN DECIDING TO RUN A STATE OR BE A SENATOR.  INTERESTING HYPOTHETICAL THERE.  OUT OF THIN AIR.  TALK ABOUT A LACK OF POLITICAL SELF AWARENESS. DEFEATING IN THE SENATE. SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LAYUP. THE HOUSE IS DECLARED TO GO TO REPUBLICANS BUT BY A SLIMMER MARGIN. AND THEN A COUPLE DAYS LATER TO SAY I SHOULD BE THE LEADER OF THE UNITED STATES AND TAKING YOU ON, MITCH McCONNELL, HE LOST YESTERDAY 37-10. THE CAUCUS DISAGREED WITH THE ASSESSMENT OF HIMSELF.  LET'S BRING IN DICK DURBIN OF ILLINOIS, CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. SENATOR, FIRST OF ALL, WOULD LOVE TO GET YOUR REACTION TO THE HISTORIC MIDTERMS. NOBODY AROUND HERE, NOBODY WE HAVE THAT YOU CANNED TO HAS A SEEN A MIDTERM LIKE IT.  WHEN YOU DO THE ANALYSIS, IT REALLY WAS A FASCINATING ELECTION. IT STARTS WITH THE FACT OF QUALITY CANDIDATES. THE POSITION WAS IN SYNC WITH MOST AMERICANS. LOOK AT THE TURNOUT OF WOMEN EXPRESSING THE STRONGLY HELD FEELINGS ON REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH. WE HAD A SITUATION WITH A RECORD TO SPEAK OF AND MOST AMERICANS CAN UNDERSTAND AND IDENTIFY WITH. AND THEN THE EXTREMISM ON THE OTHER SIDE REJECTED BY THE VOTERS IN VIRTUALLY EVERY CONTEST IN A SWING STATE. THEY LOST AS I HOPED THEY WOULD AND BACK ON TRACK TO SOMETHING THAT'S RELIABLE IN THE FUTURE.  I WONDER WHETHER YESTERDAY'S HISTORIC VOTE ON THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT MAY HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED IN PART BY THE ELECTION RESULTS AND MAYBE ENOUGH REPUBLICANS UNDERSTANDING THAT IF THEY KEEP TAKING POSITIONS THAT THE MOST EXTREME MEMBERS OF THE BASE SUPPORT THEY WON'T WIN GENERAL ELECTIONS.  JOE, YOU PUT THE FINGER ON IT. I SPOKE TO REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO SAT FOR HOURS TRYING TO ANALYZE WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM AND A FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS WHAT IS OUR BASE? WHAT DO THEY BELIEVE IN? IS IT JUST MAGA REPUBLICANS LOYAL TO TRUMP OR MORE TO IT? BASIC CONSERVATISM? THEY HAVE TO MAKE THAT DECISION. THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE GROUND ZERO IN THE CIVIL WAR WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS FOUR-VOTE MARGIN TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, YOU KNOW THAT CAN EVAPORATE WITH ABSENCES ON THE DAY OF THE VOTE. YOU CAN SEE COUNTRY -- UNCERTAINTY.  THERE'S TALK THAT PERHAPS THE STATES LOWERED BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE. HOW IMPORTANT WOULD IT BE TO HAVE THAT 51st VOTE?  THAT'S TRUE. WE ARE TAKING GEORGIA SERIOUSLY. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ANOTHER QUALITY CANDIDATE TO PREVAIL. THE FALL OFF IN VOTES IN THE REGULAR ELECTION SUGGEST MANY GEORGIA REPUBLICANS NOT EXCITED ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S CHOICE FOR SENATE IN GEORGIA. WE HAVE A QUALITY CANDIDATE WHO'S WORKING HARD. I'M CONTACTED BY FRIENDS SAYING HOW CAN I HELP. IT TELLS ME THAT THE DECEMBER 6th ELECTION WILL BE ONE THAT'S NATIONAL ATTENTION START TO FINISH.  SENATOR, WE ARE HEARING VOICES ON THE EXTREME MAGA RIGHT, PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY SEEMING TO DO VLADIMIR PUTIN'S BIDDING, TALKING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES NO LONGER SUPPORTING THE PUSHBACK OF VLADIMIR PUTIN, THE FREEDOM OF THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE THE PROSPECTS ARE FOR CONGRESS CONTINUING TO LEND SUPPORT TO UKRAINE IN THEIR FIGHT AGAINST THE RUSSIAN INVASION?  I THINK THERE'S A SOLID BIPARTISAN GROUP OF MEMBERS COMMITTED TO STANDING BY UKRAINE. THESE PEOPLE IN UKRAINE ARE DYING EVERY DAY. GOING THROUGH DEPRIVATIONS THAT AMERICANS CAN'T APPRECIATE. I THINK THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS STOOD BY THEM. WHEN WE HAVE SUGGESTIONS FROM MEMBERS ON THE HOUSE ON THE EXTREME THAT THEY'RE GROWING IMPATIENT I THINK TO MYSELF THE PEOPLE IN UKRAINE DID NOT INVITE THIS INVASION. THEY EVERY FIGHTING BACK SUCCESSFULLY IN AN INSPIRING WAY. WE NEED TO STAND TOGETHER WITH NATO AND ON BEHALF OF THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE.  ALL RIGHT. CHAIRMAN OF THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE, THANK YOU FOR BEING ON THIS MORNING.  THANK YOU. > WE HAVE THE CEO OF THE MESSINA GROUP, JIM MESSINA. AND SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT BENNY FARIAN. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BOTH.  WHAT IS YOUR TAKE A WEEK LATER?  A COUPLE THINGS HAPPENED LAST WEEK. ONE IS BIG DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT IN IMPORTANT SWING SEATS. WOMEN VOTERS SURGING IN WAYS THAT THE POLLS WERE WRONG. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE POLLS FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY MISSED THE SURGE. AND THEN SECOND, DEMOCRACY WON. RIGHT? YOU HAD A BUNCH OF DENIERS LOSING ALL OVER THE PLACE AND I'M PLEASED THEY LOST. WE LOST THE HOUSE. THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE AND I THINK THE PARTY NEEDS TO RALLY AROUND JOE BIDEN IN 2024.  THERE'S SO MUCH TALK ABOUT A RED WAVE OR READ TSUNAMI. THE POLLING WAS WRONG TO BOLSTER THE CLAIMS. THE HOUSE IS GONE AND HOPE TO HANG ON TO THE SENATE. BUT IN THE PIECE HEADLINED VOTERS ARE SMARTER THAN THE MEDIA. SO WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT NOW TEN DAYS AFTER THE ELECTIONS ABOUT SOME THINGS THAT WENT WRONG?  WE WORKED ON BAD POLLS, REALLY. YOU TALK TO POLLSTERS SAYING WE WERE CLOSE BUT THEY WEREN'T. THEY TOLD US IT WAS GOING TO BE A RED WAVE AND IT WASN'T. THERE'S ANXIETY BECAUSE POLLSTERS HAD BEEN WRONG, UNDERESTIMATED TRUMP IN 2016 AND THEN IN THE SENATE IN 2020 THERE WAS A REPUBLICAN UNDERESTIMATION. I ALSO THINK THERE WAS TOO MUCH MEDIA ON MEDIA GROUP THINK AND NOT ENOUGH OPENNESS TO OTHER IDEAS. THERE WAS A CERTAIN ANXIETY IF YOU SAID THERE'S A CHANCE DEMOCRATS TO HOLD THE HOUSE WHICH THERE WAS A CHANCE. THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IS VERY, VERY SLIM, TO BE SILLY AND MAYBE WISH CASTING. THEY WERE CLOSE.  THE GREAT EXAMPLE IS THE ISSUE OF ABORTION WHERE A NARRATIVE SAID RED HOT IN THE SUMMER AND NOW SUBSIDED AND THEN THE EXIT POLLS IN MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE SOMETIMES ORR THE ECONOMY.  YEAH. WHEN DOBBS -- WHEN THE DECISION CAME DOWN PEOPLE WERE LIKE THIS MIGHT NOT MOVE VOTERS AND FIVE SPECIAL VOTES AND THEN PEOPLE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WILL AND THEN IN AUGUST EVERYONE'S LIKE NO. VOTERS ONLY CARE ABOUT GAS PRICES. AND AGAIN IT WAS TOO MUCH SUPPOSITION AND NOT ENOUGH REALITY.  LOOK AT THIS FROM 30,000 FEET NOW. WE KNOW THAT THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE ARE CLOSELY DIVIDED. SENATE HAS AN AWFUL LOT OF POWER TO DO THINGS THAT THE HOUSE DOESN'T. JOE BIDEN WILL LIKELY APPOINT MORE FEDERAL JUDGES. OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED TREATIES, AMBASSADORS, CAB NET OFFICERS. CAN WHISK THROUGH THE SENATE. THE HOUSE FAR MORE DIVIDED. IF YOU'RE ADVISING THE BIDEN HOUSE, WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM TO DO OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT THE DEMOCRATS DO RIGHT AND WHAT THE REPUBLICANS LIKELY ARE GOING TO DO WRONG IN BECOMING EVEN MORE IDEOLOGICAL RUNNING THE HOUSE?  LOOK. THEY NEED TO STAY FOCUSED WHICH IS DELIVERING FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND THEY HAVE DONE THAT. FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY. INFLATION IS STILL THE BIGGEST ISSUE. IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE. IF DEMOCRATS ARE STILL TRAILING ON WHO'S BETTER FOR THE ECONOMY THEY NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT. CONTINUE TO DELIVER FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THEN DRAW A VERY SHARP CONTRAST TO THE HOUSE TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY AND CONTINUE TO OVERREACH. THEY'RE ALREADY THAT YOU CANNING ABOUT DOING AN ABORTION VOTE WHICH IS INSANE POLITICS. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO GO AFTER THAT STUFF. JOE BIDEN SHOULD JUST PLAY OFF THAT AND STAY FOCUSED ON THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. THEY HAVE A REALLY GOOD TRACK RECORD IF THEY CONTINUE TO DO THAT FOR TWO YEARS. THE POLITICS WILL SORT THEMSELVES OUT.  YOU HAD AN INTERESTING TAKEAWAY WATCHING THE RESULTS WHICH IS THAT FOR ALL THE COMPLAINT THAT IS THE POLITICIANS ARE TOO OLD AND NEEDS TO BE A NEW GENERATION YOU START TO SEE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY A BENCH. SHAPIRO IN PENNSYLVANIA. WHITMER IN MICHIGAN. WHAT DID YOU SEE IN THAT?  THERE WERE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD CANDIDATES THAT WON GOVERNORSHIPS IN SWING STATES. MICHIGAN HAS NOW THREE WOMEN IN POWER. THAT'S INCREDIBLE. AND IN WISCONSIN, A LOT OF DEMOCRATS BECOMING STARS AND THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY INTERESTING AND I HOPE THERE'S MORE COVERAGE OF THOSE GUYS.  JIM MESSINA AND MOLLY JONG-FAST, GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING ON THIS MORNING. > IN A RARE DISPLAY OF PUBLIC DISCORD UKRAINE AND THE WESTERN ALLIES CLASH OVER WHO LAUNCHED THE MISS SILL THAT KILLED TWO IN POLAND. RICHARD ENGEL HAS THE LATEST.  Reporter: ZELENSKYY INSIST DS THE COUNTRY DIDN'T FIRE A MISSILE THAT CROSSED INTO POLAND. I HAVE NO DOUBT IT WAS NOT OUR ROCKET, HE SAID. ASKED ABOUT THAT, PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYING OVERNIGHT -- THAT'S NOT THE EVIDENCE RETURN.  Reporter: POLAND'S PRESIDENT CALLED IT A TRAGIC ACCIDENT FROM A UKRAINIAN AIR DEFENSE SYSTEM. AN ASSESSMENT SHARED BY THE PENTAGON.  WE HAVE SEEN NOTHING THAT CONTRADICTS THE PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT THAT THIS EXPLOSION MOST LIKELY THE RESULT OF A UKRAINIAN AIR DEFENSE MISSILE THAT UNFORTUNATELY LANDED IN POLAND.  Reporter: THE U.S. AND NATO BLAMED RUSSIA SUGGESTING UKRAINE USING THE AIR DEFENSES AFTER RUSSIA LAUNCHED MISSILES TARGETING THE UKRAINIAN INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE THIS ATTACK THIS MORNING.  WHILE WE STILL DON'T KNOW ALL THE FACTS, WE DO KNOW ONE THING. THIS TRAGEDY WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED BUT FOR RUSSIA'S NEEDLESS INVASION OF UKRAINE AND THE MISSILE ASSAULTS AGAINST UKRAINE'S CIVILIAN INFRASTRUCTURE.  Reporter: RUSSIA TRIED TO CAPITAL IDES ON THE CONFUSION ACCUSING THE ENEMIES OF WHIPPING UP HYSTERIA. THE U.N. AMBASSADOR SAYING THIS IS A CONSCIOUS ATTEMPT TO BRING NATO INTO DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE COUNTRY. RUSSIA SAYS THE MISSILES AGAINST IRAN AT LEAST 20 MILES FROM THE POLISH BORDER. > AND WE WILL HAVE MORE AHEAD ON THE DEADLY MISSILE STRIKE IN POLAND. > PLUS A GUEST THIS MORNING SAYS ELECTION DENIERS ARE NOT DONE YET.

        "trs": "> WELCOME BACK. DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE SAID HE IS CONSIDERING WHETHER TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2024 AND DOUBLED DOWN ON THE REMARK THAT IS VOTERS WILL NOT HAVE TO SETTLE FOR THE FORMER PRESIDENT.  HE'S ENTITLED TO ANNOUNCE THE INTENTIONS WHENEVER HE DESIRES BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE'LL HAVE BETTER CHOICES COME 2024. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY --  THAN DONALD TRUMP?  I DO.  I DO. HE SAYS.  I DO!  FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERING A PRESIDENTIAL RUN TWEETING YESTERDAY, WE NEED MORE SERIOUSNESS, LESS NOISE AND LEADERS WHO ARE LOOKING FORWARD. POMPEO DID NOT MENTION TRUMP. AND THEN THERE'S HOUSE MINORITY LEADER McCARTHY DODGING AND THEN IGNORING QUESTIONS.  ANNOUNCING?  PRESIDENT TRUMP.  WHY?  ARE YOU PREPARED TO ENDORSE HIM?  YOU GUYS ARE CRAZY.  DO YOU SUPPORT HIM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT?  DO YOU MIND STOPPING FOR A MINUTE?  DO YOU WANT HIM TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT?  WHERE HAVE YOU GONE? HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT. WHICH SAM STEIN, MEANS THAT HE WASN'T WORRIED ABOUT THE THREAT FROM MAR-A-LAGO, A REMAINING SUPPORTERS SAID THAT McCARTHY IS GOING TO HAVE TO STRONGLY SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP. HE'S JUST COMPLETELY AVOIDING IT AND WANTS TO BE THE NEXT SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE SO A GUY WALKING AVOIDING ANSWERING THE QUESTION IS SIMPLY REFLECTING THE WILL OF THE MEMBERS.  LOOK. THIS ALL REMIND ME OF THIS MOVIE \"FLIGHT NIGHT\" WITH VAMPIRES.  GO AHEAD.  I WON'T GO DOWN THAT ROAD. LOOK. I ALIGN MYSELF HERE WITH JEN'S COMMENTS WHICH IS, I DO THINK TRUMP CAN PROBABLY USE THIS TO HIS ADVANTAGE. HE RAN SUCCESSFULLY AS AN OUTSIDER IN 2015. HE WAS THE PRESIDENT IN BETWEEN THEN AND NOW. HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED THE GOP ESTABLISHMENT TO RUN FOR OFFICE. HE'S DONE IT BEFORE WITHOUT IT. TWO, ON THE FUND RAISING FRONT THE MEGA DONORS ARE HELPFUL BUT THE MAIN CASH BASE IS THE ONLINE DONATIONS. THIRD COMPONENT IS PENCE AND THE PILE-ON. THAT'S MORE TRICKY TO NAVIGATE BUT TRUMP HAS LEVERAGE. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ALL TRUMP HAS TO DO IS NOT ELECT THE MAN SPEAKER WHEN THE VOTE IS HELD IN PUBLIC IN EARLY JANUARY. THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY WOULD BE SO SLIM. I KNOW TRUMP'S IN A WEAKENED STATE BUT HE HAS BEEN BEFORE. WE THOUGHT IT WAS THE LAST CHAPTER FOR HIM AND THEN McCARTHY WENT TO MAR-A-LAGO. I THINK HE HAS A FEW MORE TRIRKS UP THE SLEEVE.  IT IS NOT JUST DONORS AND THE MONEY BUT REPUBLICAN LEADERS FINDING A WAY TO SPEAK TO THE TRUMP ISSUE WITHOUT MENTIONING TRUMP'S NAME. LOOK AT A GOVERNOR WHO'S NOW WORKING WITH COREY LEWANDOWSKI WHO WORKED WITH TRUMP.  YEAH. SHE WAS QUOTED. THE FACT HE IS SITTING WITH HER. WHY? SHE TALKED ABOUT THE NEED TO EXPAND THE BASE OF THE PARTY AND TALK TO PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT TRUMP AND DON'T SUPPORT TRUMP. PUTTING ASIDE THE CRAZY AND WE SHOULD NOT, THAT IS THE KIND OF MESSAGE THAT WINS ELECTIONS. IT IS SO STARKLY DIFFERENT THAN KARI LAKE PUNCHING THE McCAIN SUPPORTERS AND PEOPLE THAT LOVE McCAIN IN THE FACE. AND THE EXPANSION OF THE VOTE IS WHAT EITHER PARTY NEEDS TO DO. THAT'S A SMART MESSAGE.  THAT MESSAGE, IT IS INTERESTING. THAT MESSAGE STANDS OUT. JUMPED OF THE PAGE TO ME. REPUBLICANS TALKING LIKE THEY HAVEN'T SPOKEN IN A DECADE. WE HAVE TO EXPAND THE BASE. NOME DOESN'T GOVERN LIKE A PERSON THAT NEEDS TO EXPAND THE BASE. YOU HAD MITCH McCONNELL SAYING THAT THE REPUBLICANS WERE TOO HARSH, SEVERE. THEY SCARED AWAY INDEPENDENTS. I SAW A HEADLINE IN \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" THAT THE SENATE GONE OVER A PROCEDURAL SAFEGUARD TO ENSURE MARRIAGE EQUALITY. SHOCKING HEADLINE HOW EASILY THAT PROCEDURAL VOTE PASSED. REMEMBER AGAIN, JUST FOR PERSPECTIVE, THEN VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WENT ON A SUNDAY SHOW AND SAID THE ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTED MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND PAID A TERRIBLE PRICE FOR IT INSIDE THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE BECAUSE BARACK OBAMA WAS RUNNING FOR ELECTION. SO THAT WAS JUST A DECADE AGO THAT EVEN PROGRESSIVES WERE ANGRY AT JOE BIDEN FOR GETTING AHEAD OF THEM ON THE MESSAGE. YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS COMING TOGETHER TO SUPPORT A SAME SEX MARRIAGE PROTECTION WHICH AGAIN WE WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN THE VOTE PASSED THAT CLEANLY BEFORE LAST WEEK. THERE IS AN UNDERSTANDING. THERE IS A BIG UNDERSTANDING I THINK AMONG REPUBLICANS THAT THEY HAVE GOT TO STOP TURNING OFF INDEPENDENTS AND MODERATES TO WIN ELECTIONS AGAIN.  ALMOST A DIRECT QUOTE FROM MITCH McCONNELL. HE SAID WE GOT WIPED OUT AMONG INSPECTEDS. THE VOTE YESTERDAY PROCEDURAL HURDLE ON THE GAY MARRIAGE LEGISLATION 62 VOTES. SHOULD POINT OUT MITCH McCONNELL VOTED AGAINST IT. THAT'S ONE STEP REPUBLICANS MAY BE RECOGNIZING BUT THEN THE EXTREMISM ON ABORTION, ON GUNS AND DEMOCRACY AND THE OTHER THINGS THAT COST THEM DESPERATELY IN THIS ELECTION AND STUNNED THEM. ARE THEY ABLE TO CHANGE THE POSITIONS ON THOSE OR MODERATE A LITTLE BIT TO RECAPTURE THE INDEPENDENTS THAT FLED FROM THEM A COUPLE DAYS AGO?  MAKE NO MISTAKE. WHEN WILLIE TALKS ABOUT EXTREMISM ON THE POSITIONS WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE. THE MAJORITY ARE A PLURALITY OF AMERICANS ON ABORTION. THEY SUPPORT THE 15-WEEK BAN THAT JOHN ROBERTS SUPPORTED IN MISSISSIPPI LAW THAT THE REST OF THE COURT MIGHT HAVE GONE ALONG WITH. IF THEY HAD THE WHOLE WORLD POLITICALLY MIGHT HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BUT 10-YEAR-OLD GIRLS RAPED HAVING TO FLEE THE STATE. CANDIDATES RUNNING FOR GOVERN TALKING ABOUT 14-YEAR-OLD GIRLS RAPED BY THE UNCLE WHY THERE CAN'T BE AN EXCEPTION. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GUNS. REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF AN ISSUE NOW SINCE SANDY HOOK. 90% OF AMERICANS SUPPORT UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS AND OTHER GUN SAFETY LAWS. ARE REPUBLICANS STILL GOING TO SUPPORT THE 7% TO 8%, THE 9% POSITION? JUST TO PLEASE SOME GUN LOBBYISTS. DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF POLITICAL SENSE.  IT DOES NOT.  ALL OF THIS ADDS UP AND MAKES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY LOOK LIKE IT'S OUT OF TOUCH WHICH IS WHY REPUBLICANS UNDERPERFORMED HISTORICALLY THIS WEEK. > KEVIN McCARTHY IS POISED TO BE THE NEXT HOUSE SPEAKER. DOESN'T HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THE HOUSE CAUCUS. WE HAVE THE PREVIEW OF WHAT COULD BE A CHAOTIC NEW TERM ON CAPITOL HILL. THAT'S NEXT ON \"MORNING JOE.\" 20221117133209.923|20221117133616.970",

        "trs": "EARLIER TONIGHT WE FINALLY GET A CALL ON CONTROL OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. IT COMES JUST OVER A WEEK AFTER THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, WHICH IS A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. NBC NEWS DECISION AS PROJECTS REPUBLICANS WILL CONTROL THE HOUSE IN THE NEXT CONGRESS, WITH AT LEAST 218 SEATS, A VERY VERY SLIM MAJORITY. THERE ARE EIGHT REMAINING UNCALLED SEATS THAT WILL DETERMINE JUST HOW NARROW THE MARGIN WILL BE FOR REPUBLICANS. POTENTIALLY, IF HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY BECOME SPEAKER. CARLOS COOK CARRABELLE IS A FORMER CONGRESSMAN FROM FLORIDA. CARLOS, I WANTED TO HAVE YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS NEWS, BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH DISCUSSION OF FREEDOM CARR CAUCUS IN THE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. THE MAJORITY MAKER CAUCUS HERE WILL BE THE 12 OR SO MEMBERS REPRESENTING BIDEN DISTRICTS WHO ARE COMING INTO CONGRESS. YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE, RIGHT? YOU ARE IN A SWING DISTRICT. YOU ARE FRONTLINE MEMBER WHO SOUGHT YOUR SEAT LOST OR SEAT IN 2018. HOW DO THOSE FOLKS FIGURE IN THE CALCULATIONS OF HOW MCCARTHY AND THE CAUCUS AS A WHOLE OPERATE IN THE MAJORITY?  WELL, CHRIS, THOSE MAJORITY MAKERS FOR THE TIME BEING ARE SUPPORTING KEVIN MCCARTHY. THIS TENDS TO HAPPEN. THE MAJORITY MAKERS ARE THE ONES WHO TEND TO MAKE GET THE MOST ATTENTION FROM LEADERSHIP, THE MOST SUPPORT IN TRYING TO WIN THEIR ELECTIONS AND THAT MEANS CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS. SO WHERE THOSE MEMBERS WILL BE CRITICAL IS IF MCCARTHY FAILS TO GET THE VOTES. AND BY THE WAY OF MATT GATES CALLING MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE, THE REPUBLICAN SAYING THERE IS NO WAY MCCARTHY HAS THEIR VOTES THAT HE CAN GUARANTEE BUT WE WILL SEE IF THAT'S TRUE OR NOT. WHERE THOSE MAJORITY MAKERS CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IS IF MCCARTHY DOESN'T GET THE VOTES, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? A CANDIDATE TO THE RIGHT OF MCCARTHY IS PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GET THE SUPPORT OF THOSE MAJORITY MAKERS. THAT'S REALLY WHERE YOU CAN GET INTO SWITCH RATION WHERE THE HOUSE COULD FALL INTO CHAOS. AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A BAD CHAOS, BECAUSE WHAT YOU COULD GET IS THE FIRST SPEAKER AT LEAST NOT NO LONG TIME, ELECTED WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. THAT WOULD BE AN GAME-CHANGER IN AMERICAN POLITICS.  I THINK THAT REMAINS NOT A LIKELY SCENARIO ALTHOUGH A POSSIBLE ONE. IF, LET'S SAY MCCARTHY DID IS WIN THE SPEAKERSHIP. OR WHOEVER IT IS. HERE'S MY BIG QUESTION. WHEN IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT REPUBLICANS WERE GONNA HAVE A 30 SEAT MAJORITY IT SEEMED ESSENTIALLY INEVITABLE THAT THEY WOULD, FOR INSTANCE, IMPEACH JOE BIDEN. THAT THE CRIES TO DO THAT FROM THE BASE, THE WAY THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD BE URGING THEM TO DO THAT FROM THE SIDELINES, IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR MCCARTHY TO HOLD THEM BACK EVEN IF HE THOUGHT IT WAS BAD POLITICS. WITH A FIVE VOTE MARGIN, THAT SEEMS WAY DICE HERE, TO ME. I'M JUST SPECULATING. AS SOMEONE WHO OCCUPIED PRECISELY THE KIND OF SEAT THAT WOULD BE IMPERILED BY THAT VOTE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?  SO, CHRIS, LET ME GIVE YOU PERSPECTIVE ON HOW DIFFICULT THE SITUATION OF THE HOUSE IS GOING TO BE FOR REPUBLICANS. IN 2015 WHEN I STARTED MY SERVICE, JOHN BOEHNER WAS THE SPEAKER. HE HAD 240 REPUBLICANS AND THAT REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE WAS UNGOVERNABLE. SO BOEHNER LEFT AND LEFT IT TO PAUL LIONS AND SAID TAKE, THIS AND DONE. PAUL IAN START OF THE NEXT CONGRESS WAS 240 REPUBLICANS. HE WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE TACTFUL AND HAVE MORE PATIENCE, THOUGH HE HAD AN EASIER JOB. BUT STILL THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS, THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF DIFFICULT SITUATIONS THAT PAUL RYAN WAS PUT IAN. AND THAT WAS A FAIRLY HEALTHY MAJORITY, WITH 240 MANAGER MEMBERS. 220, 221? WHEN YOU LOOK BACK AT THE RECENT HISTORY OF THE HOUSE, THE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE, IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY DIFFICULT JOB FOR KEVIN MCCARTHY OR FROM WHOEVER ENDS UP GETTING IT.  BUT WHAT DOES THAT CASH OUT TO IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO? THAT'S MY REAL QUESTION. I WAS SCARED OF THE WORST, LIKE, THEY'RE GONNA DEFAULT ON THE DEBT CEILING, THEY'RE GONNA IMPEACH EVERYONE, THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A SPECIAL COMMITTEE, A SPECIAL HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP COMMITTEE. WHATEVER THAT IS HOW MUCH DOES THE NARROWEST MAJORITY SHRINK THE REALM OF POSSIBLE THINGS THEY CAN UNDERTAKE?  WITHOUT A DOUBT THIS HARD-LINE STUFF IS GOING TO BE OUT OF BOUNDS BECAUSE THOSE CENTRIST MEMBERS ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF POWER THEMSELVES. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW THIS TYPE OF POLICY TO MOVE FORWARD. I THINK WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT A LOT OF, WHICH I THINK MOST AMERICANS WOULD APPRECIATE, IS THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNANCE GROUP, WHICH IS THE CAUCUS FOR CENTRIST REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE, TO WORK WITH THE NEW DEMOCRATS, WHICH IS THE CAUCUS OF CENTRIST DEMOCRATS, TO DRIVE THE CHAMBER TO TRY TO MOVE POLICY THEY CAN GET SUPPORT FROM BOTH SIDES, WHICH OF COURSE IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE SENATE. SO YOU MIGHT MOVE INTO A SITUATION WHERE THE HOUSE ISN'T PASSING ALL THESE MESSAGING BILLS, ALTHOUGH MOST OF THEM NEVER BECOME LAW, THEY ARE STILL KIND OF DESTRUCTIVE TO THE FABRIC OF THE COUNTRY. INSTEAD YOU'LL GET A HOUSE THE PASSES BILLS THAT ARE BUILT FROM THE CENTER OUT AND THAT MOST AMERICANS CAN GET BEHIND.  I CONTINUE TO THINK THAT IS UNLIKELY, BUT IT IS ONE POSSIBILITY. THE BIG TEST FOR ME, CONGRESSMAN, IS ABORTION. LIKE HR ONE IS BASICALLY LIKE A NATIONAL ABORTION BAN IS HR1 AND EVERY REPUBLICAN CONGRESS. DO WE SEE THAT COMING OUT OF THE GATE HERE? THAT'S A ONE THING, TO LOOK OUT. FOUR FORMER CONGRESSMAN CARLOS CURBELO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ELECTION DENIERS RAN FOR IMPORTANT POSITIONS IN NEARLY ALL OF THEM WERE DEFEATED. SO, WHAT SHOULD WE FEEL ABOUT THE STABILITY OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY? Y? on a full charge. 20221117012958.129|20221117013346.591",

WARNOCK HAD TO WIN IT A SECOND TIME IN JANUARY OF 2021. JUST LAST WEEK, IT WAS THE SAME, -- ONLY A TWO-YEAR TERM, AND ONCE, AGAIN RAPHAEL WARNOCK GOT THE MOST VOTES. BUT AGAIN, NOT 50%, AND SO YET ANOTHER RUNOFF. ON DECEMBER 6TH, HE WILL TRY TO WIN FOR THE FOURTH TIME AGAINST THE SAME BAD REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE THAT MAYBE LAST WEEK, HERSCHEL LOCKER. FOR THE RUNOFF, REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST THEIR MESSAGING. YOU RECALL THE MEETING TO -- LEAD UP TO THE MIDTERM ELECTION. THIS IS HOW REPUBLICANS CAMPAIGN FOR WATER.  IF WE CAN WIN IN GEORGIA, IT'S OVER FOR THEM. DO YOU REALIZE THAT? THE PATHWAY TO THE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE RUNS THROUGH THE STATE OF GEORGIA. HERSCHEL BEATS WARNOCK GAME, SET, MATCH.  WELL, THAT SHIP HAS SAILED. DEMOCRATS ALREADY WON THE MAJORITY, AND SO THE QUESTION FOR GEORGIA VOTERS NOW IS NOT WHICH PARTY YOU WANT CONTROL OF THE U.S. SENATE, IT'S WHETHER THIS IS THE GUY THAT YOU WANT REPRESENTING YOU.  AND WE WERE READY FOR THE GREEN AGENDA, RAISE MY HAND RIGHT NOW. BUT WE'RE NOT READY RIGHT NOW. DON'T LET THEM FOOL YOU LIKE THIS IS NOT A NEW AGENDA. THIS IS NOT A NEW AGENDA. WE ARE NOT PREPARED, WE'RE NOT READY RIGHT NOW. ALL WE NEED TO DO IS KEEP HAVING THAT GAS GUZZLING CARS, WE GET -- WE ARE DOING THE BEST WE CAN.  THIS IS PROBABLY STILL GOING TO BE A NECK AND NECK RACE THIS TIME AROUND. HERSCHEL WALKER WILL NOT HAVE REPUBLICAN -- WHICH PROBABLY HELPED HIM OUT. DEMOCRATS ARE ALREADY MOBILIZING FOR WARNOCK WHO IS A STAR IN THE PARTY WITH A VERY BRIGHT FUTURE. FRED HICKS IS ATLANTA-BASED POLITICAL STRATEGIST WHO WORKED ON 100 OF CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA, AND HE JOINS ME NOW. FRED, THE FACTOR HERE THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO IS THAT THIS IS A SPECIAL, KEMP IS NOT IN THE BALLOT, HE WILL BE CAMPAIGNING WITH WALKER ON SATURDAY FOR HIS SEAT, BUT HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THAT WILL AFFECT THE TURNOUT?  CHRIS, YOU SAID IT RIGHT THERE. THIS IS ALL ABOUT TURNOUT. THERE ARE SOME STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS RUNOFF AND THE LAST ONE THAT WE ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT. LAST TIME IN 2020, YOU HAD TWO MONTHS -- YOU HAD ABSENTEE VOTING WHICH WAS VERY STRONG. YOU HAD DRAWBACKS IT EVERYWHERE. REPUBLICANS CHANGED THOSE RULES, AND SO WE BASICALLY HAD VERY LITTLE TO DO IN THIS RUNOFF, AND DROP BOXES ARE LOOKING INSIDE OF THE FACILITIES. BETWEEN HOURS AND 9 TO 5 IN MOST CASES. ALL HERSCHEL WATER HAS A BIG OBSTACLE -- A BIG NUMBER TO OVERCOME, SENATOR WARNOCK AND DEMOCRATS, WE HAVE A LOT THAT WE HAVE TO DO TO OVERCOME THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES CREATED BY S V 202.  HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THAT IT DOES CHANGE THE RACE ON THE GROUND? LAST TIME, IT FELT LIKE THE RACE -- THESE RACES TEND TO FEEL LIKE THEY GET RE-RUN AGAIN IN SOME WAYS. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS, DOES ANYTHING CHANGE IN FOUR WEEKS IN THAT BEFORE ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS WAS WHO WILL CONTROL THE U.S. SENATE. NOW THE QUESTION IS SQUARELY, WHICH OF THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS DO YOU WANT REPRESENTING YOU IN GEORGIA?  ABSOLUTELY. GEORGIA HAS BEEN THE LAUGHING STOCK OF THE COUNTRY IN MANY RESPECTS. OUR FRIENDS ALL OVER, NEW YORK, CALIFORNIA, THEY ASK HOW IS HERSCHEL WALKER EVEN COMPETING? MY RESPONSE IS, THIS IS STILL GEORGIA. I THINK WITH NEVADA COMING IN FOR DEMOCRATS RIGHT NOW, IT WAS SECURING THE MAJORITY. ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO, WE HAD A 50/50 SENATE AND SENATE REPUBLICANS DECIDED TO SWITCH OVER TO CONGRESS. THAT CHANGED CONTROL OF THE CONGRESS SENATE. AND SO FOR THIS ELECTION, I WAS SAYING THIS ABOUT SECURITY FOR THE MAJORITY SO THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT INVESTORS, TALKING ABOUT LEGISLATION, TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY DEALING WITH A JOE MANCHIN OR SINEMA. WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL ONE VOTE THAT WE NEED SO WE CAN MOVE LEGISLATION AHEAD. FOR HERSCHEL LOCKER IN THE REPUBLICANS, IT'S ABOUT SAYING, LOOK, WE HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN TYING UP THE 50/50 SENATE. LET'S DO THAT AGAIN. FOR DEMOCRATS, IT'S ABOUT SECURING THE MAJORITY SAY THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH THINGS LIKE A NATIONAL BAN ON ABORTION, -- AND ANTI-CLIMATE LEGISLATION AND OTHER STATES THAT ARE UP THERE.  YOU JUST MENTIONED ABORTION WHICH WAS A MAIN ISSUE, A SIGNIFICANT REPORTING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT WOMEN WHO SAID THAT HERSCHEL LOCKER HAD PAID FOR, PRESSURED FOR THEM TO HAVE AN ABORTION. ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO -- AND THEY GET WELL CARD. HE DENIED THOSE, BUT THEN ALSO SAID THAT I DID DIFFERENT THINGS IN THE PAST. A JUDGE HAS JUST STRUCK DOWN THE ABORTION BAN LAW IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA, I WONDER HOW MUCH THAT FOCUSES REPUBLICAN ATTENTION ON THE TWO DIFFERENT TENSION BETWEEN THESE TWO MEN ON THE QUESTION OF ABORTION, WHICH WE LEARNED FROM THE MIDTERMS REALLY IS A MASSIVELY IMPORTANT TO VOTERS?  IT MUST BE IMPORTANT TO VOTERS IN GEORGIA. IN GEORGIA, VOTERS SUPPORT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH -- I THINK THAT THEY'RE ALREADY GOING TO APPEAL THAT RULE. I THINK THAT ABORTION, REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH COULD BECOME THE CENTRAL MISSION HERE NEXT TO -- DO YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU TRUST THE CHARACTER? LISTEN, CHARACTER IS SOMETHING THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT, AND THIS HERSCHEL WALKER CHARACTER, WE WANT TO HAVE A NATIONAL BAN -- BUT APPARENTLY, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU PAID FOR MULTIPLE ABORTIONS, OR YOU'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF SUCH BY PEOPLE. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHARACTER IN TERMS OF ISSUES. PRIDE IS NOT A BIG DEAL, WE HAD A LOT OF NOTICE GOING INTO THE ELECTION LAST WEEK, BUT RIGHT NOW 'V END|20221117015955|2022-11-17_0100_US_MSNBC_All_In_With_Chris_Hayes ",

        "trs": "> RIGHT NOW, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, OUR FAMILY MEMBERS, OUR CONGRESSIONAL STAFF MEMBERS AND OUR CONSTITUENTS, ARE SCARED. THE SAME LEGAL ARGUMENTS THAT THE SUPREME COURT RESTED UPON TO REVERSE ROE V. WADE COULD JUST AS EASILY BE APPLIED TO REVERSE NUMEROUS OTHER CASES RELATED TO FAMILIES, RELATED TO INTIMATE RELATIONS, TO CONTRACEPTION AND MARRIAGE.  TODAY THE SENATE IS TAKING A TRULY BOLD STEP FORWARD IN THE MARCH TOWARDS GREATER JUSTICE, GREATER EQUALITY, BY ADVANCING THE RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT.  WE KNOW THAT NEARLY A MILLION AMERICANS ARE ALREADY COMMITTED TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGES WHO SIMPLY WANT LONG-TERM CERTAINTY. NOT ONLY A MILLION WHO ARE ALREADY COMMITTED TO A SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BUT THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED THE CEREMONIES, THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR FAMILY.  MOMENTS AGO, THE UNITED STATES SENATE TOOK THE FIRST STEP TO PROTECT MARRIAGE EQUALITY, SPECIFICALLY SAME-SEX AND INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE, WITH 62 SENATORS VOTING TO MOVE A BILL FORWARD THAT WOULD PROVIDE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGES. 12 REPUBLICANS JOINED WITH THE DEMOCRATS SUPPORTING THE MEASURE. THE MOVEMENT TO CODIFY MARRIAGE EQUALITY, MARRIAGE PROTECTIONS INTO LAW, GAINING STEAM THIS SUMMER AFTER CLARENCE THOMASHIN COULD OVERTURN THE RULING, STRIPPING AWAY THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION ACCESS. THE BILL WILL HEAD FOR FINAL PASSAGE. JOINING US IS SEAN PATRICK MALONEY. HE IS THE FIRST -- YOU ARE THE FIRST OPENLY GAY CONGRESSMAN FROM NEW YORK. YOU LED THE EFFORTS TO PASS THE DEFEND MARRIAGE EQUALITY ACT IN JULY. WE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT IT MANY, MANY TIMES. TAKE ME THROUGH WHAT THIS WAS LIKE. WAS 12 REPUBLICAN SENATORS MORE OR LESS THAN YOU WERE EXPECTING OR HOPING FOR?  WELL, IT'S ENOUGH. WHAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW IS WE NEED ENOUGH PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE TO BELIEVE IN THINGS LIKE THAT LOVE SHOULD MATTER AND MARRIAGE EQUALITY SHOULD BE THE LAW OF THE LAND. THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THANK HERE. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR SCHUMER. TAMMY BALDWIN HAS BEEN A HERO TO ME AND OTHERS. ALSO TO SPEAKER PELOSI WHO HAD THE VISION TO PUT THIS ON THE FLOOR AND DEMONSTRATED THERE WAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THIS. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE STOPPED SHORT OF RAISING OUR TRANS BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND THE FIGHTS THAT THEY ARE STILL WAGING. IN SOME WAYS, THIS BIPARTISANSHIP ONLY EXISTS TO A MORE NARROW ISSUE. WHAT WE NEED IS THE EQUALITY ACT AND FULL EQUALITY FOR LGBT PLUS PEOPLE AND THEIR PATPARTNERS AN THEIR FAMILIES. IT'S A GOOD DAY. I'M PROUD OF THE SENATE FOR TAKING THIS STEP. WANT TO THANK SENATOR SCHUMER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. WHEN I CAME TO CONGRESS, I WILL TELL YOU, MY KIDS COULDN'T GET HEALTH INSURANCE. REPEALING THAT FEDERAL LEGISLATION IS REALLY MEANINGFUL. IT'S A BIG STEP FORWARD.  I REMEMBER LAST TUESDAY THE FIRST PIECE OF EXIT POLL DATA WE GOT BEFORE ANY RESULTS HAD COME IN, IT WAS RIGHT AFTER 5:00, WAS THE 60% OF VOTERS IN THE MIDTERMS WHO DISAPPROVED OF DOBBS. WITH THAT NUMBER WAS 60% OF ALL VOTERS WHO DISAPPROVED OF THE SUPREME COURT. DOBBS IS A BIG DEAL. IT WAS JUST AS CLEAR IN JUSTICE THOMAS' CONCURRENCES THAT TARGETING THIS DECISION, WHICH IS MORE POPULAR NOW THAN THE DAY IT WAS MADE IS VERY MUCH ON THE TABLE FOR THE SUPREME COURT. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT FIGURED INTO THE MIDTERMS?  I HOPE THE SUPREME COURT IS GETTING THE MESSAGE THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS DON'T WANT TO GO BACK. WHATEVER THAT MAGA MAJORITY ON SUPREME COURT THINKS, THEY WILL RUN INTO A PROBLEM WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WITH THE OTHER BRANCHS OF GOVERNMENT WHO THROUGH LEGITIMATE CHECKS AND BALANCES MEANS CAN MAKE OUR VOICES HEARD ON THIS. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE DOING TODAY IS MAKING IT CLEAR THAT IT'S THE WILL OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THROUGH THE CONGRESS TO NOT GO BACKWARDS ON MARRIAGE EQUALITY. THE SUPREME COURT STILL MATTERS. THE CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED RIGHT TO MARRY IN ALL 50 STATES IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THE CONGRESS CAN DO THE WAY THE SUPREME COURT DID. IT STILL MATTERS WE DEFEND THE DECISION AT THE SUPREME COURT AND IN THE FUTURE, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE BACKSTOPPING SOME OF THE PROTECTIONS THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION.  IS THIS A BITTERSWEET DAY, THIS THING YOU HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR, THAT YOU LENT YOUR VOICE TO IN CONGRESS AND IN THE COUNTRY AND IN THE MEDIA? WITH A SEAT YOU WILL NOT HOLD IN JANUARY.  LOOK, I MEAN, HERE IS WHAT I THINK -- I'M THINKING ABOUT AND WHAT I HOPE PEOPLE THINK ABOUT. WHEN THIS CONGRESS STARTED, THERE WERE PEOPLE COMING THROUGH THE WINDOWS AND DOORS TRYING TO OVERTURN A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. THERE WAS AN INSURRECTION. THERE WAS A MOVEMENT THAT SEEMED ON THE RISE TO BRING AUTHORITARIANISM TO THE UNITED STATES, TO PLAY FOOTSY WITH CONSPIRACY THEORISTS. WE PASSED AN AGENDA TO HEAL OUR COUNTRY, TO MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS FROM OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELPING OUR VETS TO MAKING SENIORS' PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AFFORDABLE TO CLIMATE CHANGE TO BRINGING JOBS BACK FROM CHINA. WE HAD AN ELECTION WHERE DEMOCRACY GOT STRONGER. WE HAD A DEMOCRACY WHERE THE FORCES OF DEMOCRACY GAINED STRENGTH. I THINK A LOT OF US FEEL BETTER ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY ONE WEEK AFTER THIS ELECTION THAN WE FELT ONE WEEK BEFORE IT WHEN WE WEREN'T CERTAIN WHETHER WE WERE GOING UP OR DOWN. IT'S NOT ABOUT ME AND ANY ONE SEAT. I WILL POINT OUT THAT WE LED AN EFFORT THAT HAD THE BEST RESULT IN A FIRST TERM MIDTERM SINCE KENNEDY WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. MOST PEOPLE WERE SAYING I WAS OUT OF MY MIND WHEN I SAID WE WOULD HOLD OUR OWN. THE FACT IS, 35 OF OUR 39 FRONTLINE CANDIDATES WON THEIR RACES AND ARE COMING BACK TO CONGRESS. WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR DEMOCRACY IS REALLY THE IMPORTANT THING. BY THE WAY, THE ACTION TODAY IN THE SENATE IS PART OF THAT.  I FELT HAVING WORKED IN WHITE HOUSE AFTER SEPTEMBER 11th THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE COUNTRY THAT WAS UNEASY AND THAT THIS COULD BE AN ELECTION WHERE VOTERS ACTED IN 2022 THE WAY THEY DID IN 2002. I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES IN THIS FIGHT. YOU GUYS WON'T BE THERE. IS THERE -- ARE THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT COMING BACK, THROUGH RETIREMENT OR THE OUTCOMES LAST WEEK, HAVE YOU HAD ANY -- EITHER OVER BEER AND NACHOS OR COFFEE AND DOUGHNUTS, IS THERE CONVERSATION AMONG YOU THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY INSURRECTION YEAR WHO WON'T BE THERE IN JANUARY?  ADAM AND I CAME TO CONGRESS TOGETHER. WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS. I HAVE RESPECT FOR HIM. YOU NEED GOOD PEOPLE IN EVERY CONGRESS. IT WON'T BE THE SAME PEOPLE. THERE'S NO INDISPENSABLE PEOPLE. THE GRAVEYARDS IN WASHINGTON ARE FULL OF INDISPENSABLE PEOPLE. WE NEED GOOD PEOPLE AND ENOUGH OF THEM TO KEEP OUR DEMOCRACY GROWING STRONGER, MAKE OUR COUNTRY MORE INCLUSIVE. I GOTTA SAY, THE RESULTS OF LAST TUESDAY, OF THE LAST ELECTION, MAKE ME MORE CONFIDENT IN THE COURSE OF OUR COUNTRY. IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE FOUGHT FOR IT. IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE STAYED IN THE FIGHT. THIS CONGRESS DIDN'T WALK AWAY, BELIEVED IN IT, PAID FOR IT WITH THEIR CAREERS. PEOPLE LIKE ADAM OR LIZ CHENEY. I DON'T MYSELF IN THOSE RANKS. I'M PROUD I WAS IN THE FIGHT. I'M PROUD WE PERSUADED ENOUGH OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE TACKLED THE TOUGH PROBLEMS. THE PRESIDENT LED ON THIS. THE SPEAKER LED ON THIS. WE WORKED THROUGH THEM. THEY GAVE US A LITTLE MORE TIME TO KEEP DOING THIS WORK. THEY RESISTED THE EFFORT BY PEOPLE TO EXPLOIT THEIR FRUSTRATIONS, ANGER, FEARS FOR POLITICAL GAIN. THE ELECTION DENIERS LOST. THE MAGA MOVEMENT IS ON THE DECLINE. DONALD TRUMP IS YESTERDAY'S NEWS, IF YOU ASK ME. WE HAVE TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND WORK FOR SOMETHING BETTER. I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD FEEL BETTER ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED ON TUESDAY.  YOU ARE THE SECOND OPTIMISM TO GRACE OUR AIRWAVES THIS HOUR. IF YOU ARE BORED, I WILL MICK YOU AN OFFER, YOU ARE HERE -- WE ARE HERE EVERY DAY AT 4:00.  I'M WORKING ON MY RESUME. I MAY HAVE FREE TIME.  WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU.  I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. MY FAMILY HAS FIRST CLAIM ON MY TIME.  I'M SURE THEY DO. I'M SURE THEY ARE ELATED. THAT'S THE TWO SIDES OF IT.  THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER.  OF COURSE. IT'S STANDING. THANK YOU. > UP NEXT, HOW PRESIDENT BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATS KEEP THEIR COALITION TOGETHER AND HANDLE THE LOOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION THAT'S NOW CLOSER THAN THE LAST ONE.

        "trs": "> IT WAS I REMEMBER LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS CAMPAIGNING I WAS WITH REPUBLICANS WHO STOOD WITH ME AND WE DID A PRESS CONFERENCE TALKING ABOUT THE BIG LIE AND THAT I HAD AN OPPONENT WHO WAS THE FACE OF IT IN NEVADA PEDALING CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND LIES ABOUT A STOLEN ELECTION, WHICH OUR COURTS PROVED WRONG, AND OUR REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE PROVED WRONG. BUT THEY CONNECTED THE DOTS. THEY CONNECTED THE DOTS BETWEEN THAT -- THAT FALSE ALLEGATION AND THE MOB. THAT TYPE OF CONVERSATION, THOSE ALLEGATIONS FUELED THE MOB ON JANUARY 6th. AND I WAS HERE. I LIVED IT JANUARY 6th. BUT YOU COULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE WHAT I WAS HEARING FROM NEVADA NS WHO ACTUALLY WATCHED IT ON TV AND THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT IT HAD FOR SO MANY NEVADAENS I TALKED TO ACTUALLY WATCHING IT REALTIME AND SEEING WHAT WAS GOING ON.  AS WE ALL AWAIT AN OFFICIAL CALL ON WHICH PARTY WILL HOLD NARROW CONTROL ON THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES NEXT TERM, THESE COMMENTS FROM SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO ABOUT JUST HOW TOP OF MIND JANUARY 6th WAS FOR VOTERS IN HER STATE RAISE AN INTERESTING QUESTION IN THIS CONVERSATION WE'VE BEEN HAVING. DID WE ALL UNDERESTIMATE THE PARADIGM SHIFTING ON THE JANUARY 6th ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL? JOINING OUR CONVERSATION THE SENIOR CALL-UPNIST FOR THE BOSTON GLOBE. MARK McKINNON IS HERE, MY GOOD FRIEND, ALSO THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER AND CO-HOST OF SHOW TIME'S THE CIRCUS AND CORNELL BELCHER, POLLSTER. IT'S THE DEMOCRACY, STUPID, OH, GOD BUT COULD IT BE. I HAVE BEEN HEARING FOR AN HOUR AND 36 MINUTES TODAY SOME OPTIMISM THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT DEMOCRACY MORE THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY DID FROM NATIONAL SECURITY FIGURES, FROM AN OUTGOING MEMBER OF CONGRESS, FROM A DEMOCRATIC OUTGOING MEMBER.  AGAIN I'M GOING TO GO KUDOS TO YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE SPOT ON ABOUT THIS IDEA THAT YOU THOUGHT THAT THE HEARINGS COULD CHANGE SOME OF THE DYNAMIC. I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL IT COULD CHANGE SOME OF THE DYNAMICS BUT I THINK IN THE END WHEN THEY PUT FORTH ALL THIS EVIDENCE AND LAID IT OUT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IT DID MOVE THE NEEDLE A COUPLE OF POINTS, AND I THINK IT WAS THE OPENING FOR THE CONVERSATION ABOUT SAVING DEMOCRACY, WHICH RELUCTANTLY DEMOCRATS CAME TO AT SOME POINT AND THE PRESIDENT GAVE A BIG SPEECH ABOUT THAT, AGAIN, DROVE THAT ISSUE UP. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS, RIGHT, WHAT DO WE WANT THE ELECTION TO BE ABOUT, RIGHT, AND REPUBLICANS WANT THE ELECTION TO BE ALL ABOUT THE ECONOMY, INFLATION, AND CRIME. HOW DO WE, YOU KNOW, KRAUSE PRESSURE VOTERS? AND IN THAT WORD CLOUD AT THE END IT WAS THE ECONOMY, IT WAS INFLATION, BUT IT WAS ALSO A CHOICE, AND IT WAS ALSO THE DEMOCRACY, STUPID. AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU IF YOU TAKE DEMOCRACY OUT OF THAT WORD CLOUD I THINK YOU HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT ELECTION THAN THE ONE WE JUST HAD.  IT'S ALSO ABOUT HOW YOU RESPONDED TO JANUARY 6th AND THE ATTACK ON PAUL PELOSI. IT WASN'T JUST THAT TRUMP SUPPORTERS CARRIED OUT THE ATTACK ON THE U.S. CAPITOL. IT'S THAT TRUMP'S ALLIES IN CONGRESS DESCRIBED IT AS A, QUOTE, NORMAL TOURIST VISIT AND REFUSED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INVESTIGATION, GIVING VOTERS UNEASE. YOU KNOW, THEY WERE ALL RUNNING. THEY WERE ALL IN BUNKERS. WHY IS ONLY ONE PARTY PLUS ADAM KINZINGER -- AND SAME FOR PAUL PELOSI. WHY DID THE EX-PRESIDENT AND PROMINENT MEDIA FIGURES ON THE RIGHT IMMEDIATELY START SPEWING SO MANY CONSPIRACY THEORIES? WHY WASN'T THE ANSWER TO CONDEMN ALL POLITICAL VIOLENCE, KIM?  YEAH, I THINK THAT IS A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT. AND JUST LIKE CORNELL SAID THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES LEADING UP TO THIS ELECTION, AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DISCERN EXACTLY WHAT MIGHT MOVE THE NEEDLE BECAUSE A LOT OF THE POLLING KIND OF PLACED IT AS IF EVERY VOTER WOULD BE A ONE-ISSUE VOTER. YOU KNOW, IF INFLATION RANKED HIGHER THAN ABORTION IS THIS GOING TO BE A GREAT RED WAVE AND VOTERS DON'T ACT LIKE PARTICULARLY YOUNG VOTERS. I THINK ABOUT PEOPLE LIKE MY STEPCHILDREN WHO WERE BORN AFTER 9/11 OR WHO WERE JUST BABIES ON 9/11. AND THIS, SEEING THE INSURRECTION, HAVING THESE HEARINGS WITH CONGRESSMAN KINZINGER AND OTHERS TAKING PLACE, REALLY MAKING CLEAR HOW PERILOUS OUR DEMOCRACY, WHAT A PERILOUS STATE OUR DEMOCRACY WAS IN MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE THAT LIFE DEFINING MOMENT FOR THEM. AND WE SAW FOR A LOT OF THEM THAT REALLY BOOSTED TURNOUT. I THINK WE KNOW A LOT OF AMERICANS WERE WATCHING IN THE BACK OF THEIR MIND IF REPUBLICANS WERE MOSTLY ELECTION DENIERS, THAT WASN'T GOING TO CHANGE. AND I AGREE WITH CORNELL. I WONDER IF REPUBLICANS ALL WENT ON AND HAMMERED ON THE INFLATION AND ECONOMY AND COST OF GAS WOULD THE RESULTS HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT? BUT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY DOESN'T HEAR IT ANYMORE. I COMPARE IT TO A REDUCTION SAUCE WHERE THE LONGER IT COOKS IT BECOMES MORE INTENSE AND IT'S NOT JUST GETTING THE VOTES IT USED TO.  EXCEPT THOSE USUALLY TURN OUT DELICIOUS, AND THE REPUBLICAN MESSAGE DOES NOT. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE -- I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT DINNER AND I DON'T WANT TO LOSE CORNELL AND KIM'S BRILLIANT THOUGHT BECAUSE I THINK THIS PIECE OF IT IS TIED TO WHAT I IN MY GUT FELT -- I WORKED IN WHITE HOUSE IN '02 WHICH WAS THE MID-TERM POST-9/11 AND PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T BE '02 BUZZ BUSH'S APPROVAL RATING WAS HIGHER THAN BIDENS. I THINK STRUCTURALLY WITHIN OUR POLITICS AND MEDIA WE WON'T HAVE POPULAR PRESIDENTS EVER AGAIN. MAYBE FOR A WEEK IF SOMETHING HAPPENS BUT NOT NORMALLY. AND I THINK THERE WAS THIS FEELING THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FROM BOTH PARTIES WENT RUNNING AND THEY HAD TO HIDE. THE INSURRECTIONISTS WERE CLIMBING THE CAPITOL SWINGING FROM IT AND HURTING LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WENT TO THE CAPITOL AND ASKED FOR A RESPONSE, AND THE DEMOCRATS SAID, YES, WE'LL INVESTIGATE, AND THE REPUBLICANS SAID, NO, YOU CAN'T EXIST, YOU DON'T EXIST, GO AWAY. AND THEN REPUBLICAN AFTER REPUBLICAN AFTER REPUBLICAN AFTER TRUMP STAFFER AFTER TRUMP STAFFER, AFTER PENCE STAFFER, AFTER PENCE STAFFER FOLLOWED AGAIN BY LAW ENFORCEMENT, CAME OUT AND SAID THIS REALLY HAPPENED. I KNOW IT REALLY HAPPENED, AND AGAIN IT CAME DOWN TO THE RESPONSE. REPUBLICANS CALLING IT A TOURIST VISIT WAS CLEARLY UNPATRIOTIC AND ALSO A POLITICAL LOSER.  NO QUESTION. I THINK IT WAS ABOUT DEMOCRACY. IT WAS ALSO ABOUT JUST THE FUNDAMENTAL ABILITY TO TELL THE TRUTH. AND I THINK ADAM KINZINGER WAS RIGHT. I THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS HISTORICALLY I GUESS WE'RE MUDDLED BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. BUT TEN, 20 YEARS FROM NOW WE'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK ON THIS INSURRECTION, IT'S GOING TO BE LIKE A GETTYSBURG EVENT. AND AS CORNELL SAID GIVEN HISTORICAL TRENDS AND FUNDAMENTALS OF THE ECONOMY, CRIME AND THE BORDER, OBVIOUSLY REPUBLICANS SHOULD HAVE AND EVERYBODY PREDICTED THERE WOULD BE A HUGE TIDE BUT THERE WASN'T. AND ALSO IT WAS JUST THE EXTREMISM. LOOK AT KARI LAKE IN ARIZONA. IT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE. YOU CAN'T FIND A BETTER CANDIDATE THAN THAT, BUT VOTERS SAID MESSAGE AND THE TRUTH STILL MATTERS.  YEAH. I MEAN, CORNELL, I'M STILL PROCESSING EVERYTHING ADAM KINZINGER SAID, AND HE WAS INCREDIBLY FORTHCOMING, BUT I BELIEVE HE JUST SAID SOMEONE AT THE SECRET SERVICE IS LYING TO US, AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT GO. IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ACTIVE PARTS OF THE CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION ARE STILL VERY MUCH ACTIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NO LONGER PUBLIC FACING. THE SORT OF THE BRICKS ARE STILL FALLING FROM THEIR PROBE ABOUT THE INSURRECTION.  RIGHT. IT'S WE'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS YET. AND WE -- LOOK, THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SMOKE. WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S FIRE BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SMOKE INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND COVERING UP. AND LOOK, YOU GO BACK TO ARIZONA, AS HAPPY -- AS HAPPY AS WE ARE THAT THE BIG LIARS AND THE DENIERS LOST, THAT GOVERNOR'S RACE WAS AWFULLY CLOSE, NICOLE.  YES.  IT WAS 49.6% OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IT WAS -- IT WAS AWFULLY, AWFULLY CLOSE, AND FOLKS, WE AREN'T OUT OF THE WOODS YET. WE'VE GOT TO STAY VIGILANT, KEEP FIGHTING, AND WE'VE GOT TO TELL A DIFFERENT STORY BECAUSE THESE ELECTIONS SHOULDN'T BE THAT CLOSE GIVEN THE FACTS, RIGHT, AND GIVEN I THINK MARK IS RIGHT THIS WILL BE A GETTYSBURG-LIKE EVENT AT SOME POINT. BUT WE'RE NOT CONVINCING AN AWFUL LOT OF AMERICANS.  YEAH, AND THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE THE CONGRESSMAN SAID, THAT IT SHOULD BE OR COULD BE UNCOMFORTABLE BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A MOMENT THAT ISN'T POLITICAL AND TRIBAL AND PARTISAN IF YOU WANT TO SAVE THE DEMOCRACY. I WANT TO ASK ALL OF YOU ABOUT THAT. WE'LL SNEAK IN A QUICK BREAK. WE WILL ALL BE RIGHT BACK. 'LL SK WE WILL ALL BE RIGHT BACK. 20221116224509.534|20221116224805.343",

        "trs": "> ALL BACK WITH US. KIM, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SINCE THE RESULTS AND YOU AND I SO MANY CONVERSATIONS, REALLY SOMETHING WE STARTED COVERING ALL DAY ON THIS SHOW AFTER TEXAS PASSED ITS VIGILANTLY ABORTION BAN WAS THE EXTREMISM OF REPUBLICAN ABORTION POLICIES AND ZEAL. AND HOW THE EXTREMIST EVEN WITHIN THE ANTI-ABORTION MOVEMENT HAD TAKEN OVER THE MOVEMENT, AND MAYBE YOU HAVE TO WORK IN REPUBLICAN POLITICS TO SEE THE DISTINCTION, BUT NO MAIN STREAM REPUBLICAN HAD EVER SUPPORTED ABORTION BANS THAT ELIMINATED EXCEPTION FOR INSTANCES OF RAPE AND INCEST AND LIFE OF THE MOTHER AND JUST ABOUT ALL THE TRIGGER LAWS WERE FAR MORE EXTREME THAN ANYTHING THAT HAD EVER RECEIVED ANY SUPPORT FROM ANY MAIN STREAM REPUBLICAN. HOW DID THE DEMOCRATS IN THIS DEMOCRACY COALITION INCLUDE THE PRO-LIFE WOMEN OF KANSAS WHO VOTED AGAINST THE ABORTION BAN THERE IN THIS GOVERNING COALITION THAT COULD BECOME A VOTING BLOC THAT DEMOCRATS CAN RELY ON AS A BULWARK AGAINST THE EXTREMISM OF THE SUPREME COURT?  WELL, I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT YOU'RE MAKING, AND IT'S SOMETHING DEMOCRATS NEED TO DO IF THEY WANT TO WIN. AND THE POINT YOU'RE MAKING I THINK IS REALLY BRILLIANT, IS THINKING ABOUT THIS IN TERMS OF EXTREMISM IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT JANUARY 6th AND ATTACKS ON DEMOCRACY AND ELECTION DENIALISM. IT JUST -- IT WAS TOO MUCH. EACH OF THESE THINGS I THINK MAY HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH ALONE, BUT COMBINED IT CERTAINLY WAS FOR A LOT OF VOTERS WHO MAY HAVE SPLIT BALLOTS OR DONE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE DONE OTHERWISE. AND SO DEMOCRATS HAVE TO -- THEY'VE LEARNED IF THERE'S A LESSON HERE IT'S THAT THEY TALK TO AMERICANS STRAIGHT. THEY TALK TO AMERICANS STRAIGHT ABOUT WHAT THE SUPREME COURT IS DOING. THEY TALK, FRANKLY, ABOUT WHAT DEMOCRACY MEANS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS AND TALK ABOUT THINGS FROM THE ECONOMY TO STUDENT LOANS. THEY TALK ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS BECAUSE VOTERS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO WILL GIVE DEMOCRATS A LOOK AT LEAST, THEY CARE ABOUT ALL THOSE THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY, TOO.  MARK McKINNON, YOU'RE A BEAUTIFUL POLITICAL MESENSER. WHAT DOES THAT MESSAGE SOUND LIKE?  I THINK THE POINT HERE, NICOLE, IS THAT BECAUSE OF BAUBS AND REACTION TO OVERREACH OF THE SUPREME COURT SUPREME COURT, USUALLY VOTERS ARE RESPONDING TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OVERREACHING. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WHERE VOTERS RESPONDED TO ANOTHER BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT OVERREACHING. I THINK TO YOUR POINT, DEMOCRATS HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY HERE TO BUILD A NEW COALITION THAT INCLUDES MANY MORE SUBURBAN VOTERS, ESPECIALLY WOMEN, BUT MEN AS WELL. TRUMP MADE IN-ROADS WITH NON-COLLEGE VOTERS AND WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE AS A RESULT OF DOBBS AND SOME THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THIS ELECTION IS THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE A NEW COALITION BUILDING ON WHAT USED TO BE REPUBLICAN VOTERS IN MANY OF THOSE SUBURBAN AREAS, BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT ISSUES LIKE DOBBS AND OTHERS AND SAY LISTEN, THIS PARTY HAS GOTTEN TOO EXTREME. WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING AT PEOPLE LIKE KARI LAKE AND OTHERS WHO ARE TELLING McMAIN VOTERS TO GET OUT, THEY'RE SAYING WAIT A MINUTE, YOU'RE TALKING TO ME HERE.  CORNELL, I GUESS THE OPPORTUNITY LIES IN THE FACT THAT POLITICIANS COME AND GO, BUT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES STAY UNTIL THEY CROAK. I MEAN, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DEMOCRATS TO ASSEMBLE A COALITION THAT DOESN'T JUST GET THEM THROUGH THE NEXT TWO YEARS, BUT THE NEXT 20. WHAT DOES THAT EFFORT LOOK LIKE, AND IS IT UNDERWAY?  WELL, YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT TO LEAN INTO MARK'S POINT ON THIS. I THINK WE'RE WATCHING SOMETHING HAPPEN THAT IS GOING TO BE PROFOUND AND IMPACTFUL LONG-TERM. BARACK OBAMA DIDN'T WIN THE MAJORITY OF COLLEGE WHITE VOTERS IN 2012, AND WHAT WE HAVE NOW, WE'RE SEEING THREE ELECTIONS WHERE COLLEGE WHITE WOMEN -- DEMOCRATS ARE WINNING COLLEGE WHITE WOMEN. THAT FUNDAMENTALLY MIGHT CHANGE THE MAP IN A LOT OF THESE STATES. TAKE PENNSYLVANIA, GO BACK A DECADE, TWO DECADES AGO, THE SUBURBS WERE A LOT MORE SOLIDLY RED AND A LOT OF RUNNING AROUND THESE URBAN AREAS. NOW IT'S PURPLISH, AND WE ARE -- WE ARE CONTINUING TO BUILD AMONG BETTER EDUCATED WHITE WOMEN VOTERS, AND THIS MIGHT BE A SEA CHANGE MOMENT IF THIS CONTINUES, BECAUSE IT IS A NEW COALITION AND IT BECOMES INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR REPUBLICANS TO BE COMPETITIVE IN SOME OF THESE BATTLEGROUND STATES. ESPECIALLY THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR WHEN YOU ARE LOSING COLLEGE EDUCATED WHITE WOMEN BY SEVERAL POINTS.  AND ALL THE THINGS THAT REPUBLICANS WERE DEFEATED OVER, ASSOCIATION WITH THE INSURRECTION AND THE INSURRECTIONISTS, DOBBS, THE SUPREME COURT IS ASSOCIATED WITH, AS WELL. TO BE CONTINUED. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR SPENDING SOME TIME WITH US. WE HAVE TO SNEAK IN A QUICK BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. 20221116225301.506|20221116225328.099",

IN 2025 A WOMAN AND PERSON OF COLOR WILL CLIMB INSIDE THE ORION SPACE CAPSULE AND LAND ON THE MOON FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1972. THE ULTIMATE GOAL BUILD A LUNAR BASE AND SPACE STATION FOR FUTURE MISSIONS TO MARS. JUST LIKE APOLLO, THE ASTRONAUTS WILL LIFTOFF ON THEIR BACKS. THERE'S 30% MORE ROOM INSIDE ARTEMIS. THERE'S A ROWING MACHINE FOR EXERCISE AND RIGHT THERE IS A COME MODE. ORION WILL ALSO RETURN LIKE APOLLO PARACHUING INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN. SPLASHDOWN SET FOR DECEMBER 11th FROM SAN DIEGO.  IT'S STILL A BLAST TO WATCH THOSE LAUNCHES.  IT REALLY IS. MY DAD WAS SO THRILLED BY THE APOLLO MISSIONS. WE WOULD GET IN FRONT OF THE TV SET AND WATCH THEM. WHEN YOU WOULD SEE THE ROCKETS GO UP, THE LAUNCH PAD GOING, THAT AMERICAN FLAG ON THE SIDE, IT'S JUST SO EXCITING AND SO GREAT OBVIOUSLY THAT THEY'RE FINALLY ABLE TO DO THIS. > EARLIER ON THE SHOW WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MIDTERMS AND THE RESULTS OF THE MIDTERMS WITH PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN DORIS KERNS GOODWIN. TAKE A LOOK.  EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU GET A GENERATION THAT COMES UP AND YOUNG PEOPLE VOTED IN RECORD NUMBERS. THEY VOTED FOR DEMOCRACY. THAT MEANS THEY WERE WILLING TO PUT THEIR SHORT-TERM NEEDS ABOUT INFLATION AND ECONOMY AGAINST THE POSITION THAT DEMOCRACY MATTERS. EVERY NOW YOU GET A GENERATION LIKE THAT. IT WAS LIKE JOHN KENNEDY TALKING ABOUT DOING SOMETHING FOR YOUR COUNTRY AND NOT YOURSELF. IT WAS OBAMA GIVING THAT SENSE OF HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. WHEN THAT HAPPENS, SOMETHING IS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY. THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. DEMOCRACY WAS ON THE BALLOT. PR TOWARDS US BUT THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES CAME THROUGH. THE REASON THEY DID, THE FIRST TIME THEY GOT TO VOTE AFTER 2020, AFTER THE JANUARY 6th, AFTER THE HEARINGS. THEY WERE ON THE BALLOT FINALLY AND THE PEOPLE CAME THROUGH AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. THAT'S THE CELEBRATION. THE SYSTEM HELD AND THE PEOPLE SPOKE THEIR MINDS AND THEY VOTED FOR SOMETHING LARGER THAN WHAT WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD, INFLATION AND ECONOMICS. THEY VOTED FOR THEIR COUNTRY AND THAT TO ME IS THE MOST EXCITING THING.  THE PEOPLE CAME THROUGH. THEY VOTED FOR SOMETHING LARGER THAN THEMSELVES. THEY VOTED FOR THE COUNTRY. WOW. FOR MORE ON THIS STORY TO ANOTHER, LET'S BRING IN OUR GOOD FRIEND PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AT RICE UNIVERSITY DOUG BRINKLEY, THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK TITLED \"SILENT SPRING REVOLUTION.\" JOHN F. KENNEDY, RACHEL, RICHARD NIXON AND THE GREAT ENVIRONMENTAL AWAKENING. WE'LL GET TO THE BOOK IN A MOMENT, DOUG. BUT DORIS WAS TALKING ABOUT FDRs RENDEZVOUS WITH DESTINY, JFK, NEW FRONTIER CHALLENGING PEOPLE TO ASK NOT WHAT THEIR COUNTRY CAN DO FOR THEM BUT WHAT THEY CAN DO FOR THEIR COUNTRY. BARACK OBAMA'S HOPE AND CHANGE AND DORIS BELIEVES A NEW GENERATION THAT PUT DEMOCRACY AHEAD OF SHORT TERM CONCERNS WHETHER IT BE INFLATION, WHETHER IT BE CRIME, THOSE SHORT TERM ISSUES, THEY VOTED AS DORIS SAID FOR SOMETHING BIGGER THAN THEMSELVES. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE?  I AGREE WITH DORIS. GENERATION Z DID AN AMAZING JOB SHOWING UP AND VOTING. YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN TEACHING, JOE, I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR A LONG TIME. THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT GOING ON RIGHT NOW ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE IN THEIR 20s. THEY REALLY WANT TO TAKE OVER AND TACKLE THE TOUGH ISSUES BUT WHEN I NOTICED PEOPLE BEING MOST CONCERN IS CLIMATE CHANGE. THEY'RE WORKING THAT BEAT ALL THE TIME. YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE MOON SHOT. THEY WANT AN EARTH SHOT. THAT FEEL OUR GENERATION OF BABY BOOMERS DIDN'T DO THEIR JOB, THAT THE PLANET IS IN DEEP DISTRESS AND WE SEE IT WITH MEGA WILDFIRES AND FLOODS AND EPIC HURRICANES. IT WILL BE PART OF OUR DAILY LIFE. SO ON CLIMATE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE LEADING. THEY TOOK THE ABORTION ISSUE AND SAID WHAT? I'M IN MY 20s AND YOU'RE TAKING A FREEDOM AWAY FROM ME? I THINK THAT BROUGHT A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE OUT AND THEN THE VERY PREMISE WHICH JOE BIDEN DID A GOOD JOB OF SHOPPING REALLY IS THAT DEMOCRACY ITSELF IS ON THE BALLOT AND DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND DEFENSE OF THE UKRAINE AND MAKING SURE NATO STAYS WHOLE. SO IT MADE THE DIFFERENCE. THEY WERE THE GAME CHANGERS IN THIS PAST ELECTION, YOUNG PEOPLE AND THAT'S EXCITING.  NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. THEY TURNED OUT AND THEY VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY DEMOCRATIC AND IN THAT CONTEXT, YOU HAD DONALD TRUMP MAKING HIS ANNOUNCEMENT LATE LAST NIGHT AT MAR-A-LAGO HE'S COMING BACK FOR MORE. ANOTHER RUN, OBVIOUSLY A VERY DIFFERENT MAN THAN HE WAS WHEN HE ANNOUNCED SEVEN YEARS AGO HE'S BEEN THROUGH AND DAMAGED BY SO MUCH ALL BROUGHT ON BY HIMSELF MOSTLY. WHAT'S YOUR ASSESSMENT OF HIS GETTING BACK INTO THE RACE AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR OUR POLITICS?  HE HAS HAD INCREDIBLY SHRINKING POLITICIAN OR POWER BROKER. IT REMINDS ME OF PHILMORE GOT OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND RAN A NOTHING PARTY FILLED WITH BIGOTRY TOWARDS MORMONS AND CATHOLICS AND JEWS AND BLACKS AND YET, HE WANTS TO BE THE GROVER CLEVELAND PRESIDENT, ONE TERM LOST AND COMES BACK IN. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE IT HAPPENING. TRUMP LOST TO HILLARY CLINTON BY 10 MILLION VOTES WHEN HE GOT TO BE PRESIDENT. THEN HE LOST THE MIDTERM. HE LOST THE PRESIDENCY AGAIN AND THIS IS A TRUMP MIDTERM LOSS. SO THIS IS A DEEPLY DAMAGED EX PRESIDENT LIKE I HAVEN'T SEEN AND INSTEAD OF NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM BEING A MIXTURE OF WAR AND HARDING KNOWN FOR CORRUPTION. ANDREW JOHNSON HE'S BEAT. HE'S HAD DOUBLE IMPEACHIMPEACHMT ONE AND HE'S TRYING TO DO SOMETHING COOKY KNOW NOTHING TRUMP PARTY. I THINK HE'LL BE CHALLENGED BY A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS.  QUITE A RESUME YOU MENTIONED AND HE'S UNDER INVESTIGATION, A COUPLE FEDERAL PROBES AND ON THE STATE LEVEL, AS WELL. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BOOK, DOUG, \"SILENT SPRING REVOLUTION\" COMES FROM RACHEL CHARLESTON'S BOOK IN 1962. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT THAT MOVEMENT AND WHAT HAPPENED IN THE '50s AND '60s.  IT BEGAN IN 1945. WHAT A SHOCKER. YES, WE WON THE WAR AGAINST JAPAN BUT NOW WE HAVE A NUCLEAR AGE AND MONOPOLY IN THE UNITED STATES OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 1945 TO 49. NOBODY ELSE HAD THEM BUT LOW AND BEHOLD, RUSSIA GOT THEM. WE'RE STILL LIVING WITH FEAR OF RUSSIA AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUT WE STARTED TESTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS REALLY WILLY-NILLY FROM 1945 TO 1992 IN THE UNITED STATES. WE TESTED 1054 NUCLEAR WEAPONS BLOWING THEM UP IN AIR SPACE. MOST OF IT IN THE MARSHALL ISLANDS OR IN THE FRENCHMAN FLATS IN NEVADA AND WE GOT FALLOUT AND PEOPLE GOT SICK. DOWN WINDIERS. THAT FALLOUT CAME TO THE EAST COAST AND SO PEOPLE WERE WORRIED BUT LIKE MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR I WROTE IN THE BOOK SAYS WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO TO INTEGRATE A LUNCH COUNTER IF THE MILK IS CONTAMINATED WITH NUCLEAR DEBRIS AND RADIO ACTIVE. THAT ANTI NUCLEAR TESTING MOVEMENT WHICH KENNEDY, JOHN F. KENNEDY DESERVES KUDOS FOR PASSING THE TEST BAN TREATY WITH RUSSIA AND BRITAIN SO WE DON'T BLOW UP WEAPONS ANYMORE LIKE THAT BUT THAT MOVEMENT WITH THE WILDERNESS LOBBY MORE LIKE THEODORE ROOSEVELT, MEANING SAVING NATIONAL PARKS, WRITING IN THE BOOK HOW LYNDON JOHNSON SAVED IN UTAH AND NORTH CASCADES IN WASHINGTON AND REDWOOD IN CALIFORNIA AND THE APOSTAL ISLANDS IN WISCONSIN AND THAT LOBBY MET WITH RACHEL CARSON AND RACHEL CARSON A ONE WOMAN REVOLUTION BECAUSE SHE WENT AFTER DDT IT WAS BAD FOR HUMAN HEALTH, ANIMAL AND WILDLIFE WOULD DIE BUT SHE WAS TELLING MOTHERS AND FATHERS OF AMERICA, YOUR CHILDREN ARE SICK IF THEY'RE PLAYING IN THEIR BACKYARD. AND AT THAT POINT, THE USDA AND COUNTIES WERE BLANKET SPRAYING DDT ALL OVER PLACES. SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S -- THESE MOVEMENTS ALL KIND OF CONGEL AND WE HAD THREE PRESIDENTS THAT MET THE MOMENT. KENNEDY, NIXON AND JOHNSON.  IT SURPRISED ME LATER ON LOOKING BACK AND GOING BACK TO NIXON'S PRESIDENCY, NIXON IS ALWAYS THE ONE THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO FIT HERE WHEN PEOPLE THINK OF NIXON, THEY FOR GOOD REASON THINK ABOUT WATERGATE AND DIRTY TRICKS. THEY THINK ABOUT THE COMMITTEE TO REELECT THE PRESIDENT. THEY DON'T THINK ABOUT THE GUY WHO, YOU KNOW, WHO FOUNDED THE EPA. THE GUY THAT ACTUALLY WAS PROGRESSIVE ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES IN THE EARLY 70s, THE SAME WAY PEOPLE WON'T BELIEVE IT BUT HE WAS PROGRESSIVE ON CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUES IN THE LATE 1950s.  ABSOLUTELY. FOR ONE THING, JOEY CAME FROM CALIFORNIA AND HE OF COURSE, LIVED IN SAN CLEMENTA SO A LOT OF RICH REPUBLICAN DONORS WERE NOT IN MY BACKYARD ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD A NUCLEAR PLANT OR AN ALUMINUM SIDING FACTORY SO NIXON UNDERSTOOD THAT BUT WHAT REALLY CHANGED IT FOR HIM IS WHEN HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT IN 1968, HE HIRED JOHN ERILCMAN. HE WAS A LAND, WATER LAWYER WHO MADE HIS FORTUNE GOING AFTER POLLUTERS. PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT -- [ LAUGHTER ]  NO.  YEAH, ERLICHMAN WAS A COVERT GREEN WORKING WITH THE SIERRA CLUB AND PEOPLE AND NIXON HAD NO INTEREST SO HE SAID YOU DRAW UP THE DOCUMENTS AND WE'LL DO IT AS LONG AS ED MUSKY DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. NIXON LOATHED MUSKY AND PART OF THE DRAMA ALSO WAS THE SANTA BARBARA OIL SPILL, JOE. IT HIT -- HE WAS ONLY PRESIDENT DAYS WHEN THAT HIT AND THEN YOU HAVE THE CUYAHOGA RIVER ON FIRE IN OHIO AND THE RUGE RIVER IN MICHIGAN. THERE IS A DRUM BEAT TO DO SOMETHING SO NIXON WANTS TO CO-OPT THE ISSUE AND 1970 HE SIGNS NIPA, WHICH IS THE BIRTH OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT, WHICH WE ALL LIVE BY TODAY. THEN NIXON GOES AFTER EARTH DAY, THE FIRST EARTH DAY, APRIL 22nd, 1970 NIXON UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS GOING ON CREATES THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AS THE FIRST AND IF IT'S RACHEL CARSON WHO WROTE SILENT SPRING TO GET RID OF DDT, IT'S RICHARD NEXT SON WHO BANS DDT IN 1972.  YEAH, YOU KNOW, WILLY, WE'RE CELEBRATING THE 15th YEAR AND PERHAPS WE NEED TO LOOK BACK OF THE 15 YEARS AND GET SOME SEGMENTS BACK. I THINK TODAY A GOOD ONE WOULD BE WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED TODAY? WHAT I LEARNED TODAY IS JOHN ERLICHMAN WAS AN ENVIRONMENTALISTS. I NEVER SAW THAT ONE COMING.  YEAH, IN THE CLOSET ABOUT IT BUT DOING IT END|20221116145955|2022-11-16_1400_US_MSNBC_Morning_Joe ",

WELCOME BACK TO \"MORNING JOE.\"  CAN YOU IMAGINE IF THEY DID THAT? WOULD NOTING GOOD.  I CHOOSE TO MOVE FORWARD. IT'S WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 16th AND IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU ALL WITH US THIS MORNING ALONG WITH JOE, WILLIE AND ME. WE ALSO HAVE COLUMNIST FOR THE \"NEW YORK POST\" JOHN IF A DOOR ITCH WITH US AND PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN AND PULITZER PRICE-WINNING AUTHOR DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN JOINS US. GOOD TO YOU HAVE BOTH WITH US. THE TWICE IMPEACHED FORMER PRESIDENT CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION ON A NUMBER OF LEVELS, BUT IN ONE CASE FOR TRYING TO OVERTURN THE 2020 ELECTION. TRYING TO SAY IT WAY STRAIGHT FACE. INSPIRED AND INSURRECTION AT THE CAPITOL, WHERE PEOPLE WERE KILLED. ANNOUNCED LAST NIGHT, THAT HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN. IN THE HOUR-LONG RAMBLING SPEECH, DONALD TRUMP REHASHED OLD CONSPIRACIES, EXAGGERATED HIS RECORD, AND RAILED AGAINST PRESIDENT BIDEN AND THE SO-CALLED RADICAL LEFT. CLAIMED TO BE A VICTIM OF A ROGUE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND DESPITE HAVING MANY HAND-PICKED CANDIDATES LOSING A WEEK AGO, DECLARED HE'S RUNNING.  A PERSONAL PRIVILEGE HERE, AFTER THE ELECTION SPOKE TO A LOT OF TRUMP SUPPORTERS.  YEAH.  AND A LOT OF REPUBLICANS. YOU KNOW WHAT I DID? I TALKED ABOUT HOW GREAT AMERICA WAS. I SAID, YOU KNOW, YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THIS BY LISTENING TO DONALD TRUMP, BY LISTENING TO --  A LOT OF HIS FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS ARE IN THE AUDIENCE, ACTUALLY. A WOMAN PARDON SITTING NEXT TO ME.  A LOT OF DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTERS, AND THE MESSAGE WAS VERY CLEAR. LET'S LOOK PAST ALL THE IN-FIGHTING AND LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE. AMERICA'S GDP, HIGHER THAN EVER. THE DOLLAR ENJOYING A GENERATIONAL HIGH. U.S. POVERTY RATES AT A 50-YEAR LOW. THE UNITED STATES MILITARY WHEN COMPARED TO ALL THE OTHER MILITARIES IN THE WORLD, IF YOU TAKE DAVID KENNEDY'S MEASUREMENT OF THE RISE AND FALL OF THE GREAT EMPIRES, WE ARE ACTUALLY STRONGER RELATIVE TO THE REST OF THE WORLD THAN EVER BEFORE. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS TO BE GRATEFUL ABOUT, ABOUT HOW STRONG THIS COUNTRY IS. AND I WAS OVERWHELMED BY PEOPLE OF BOTH PARTIES COMING UP SAYING, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, I LOVE THIS COUNTRY. I BELIEVE IN AMERICA. I'M TIRED OF THE NEGATIVITY. YOU KNOW WHERE I'M GOING! DONALD TRUMP'S SPEECH LAST NIGHT WAS NEGATIVE. EVERYTHING I'VE HEARD HIM SAY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS. TERRIBLE -- EVEN TURNS ON QAnon MUSIC TO TELL US HOW AMERICA IS TERRIBLE. IT'S A FAILING NATION. ITS MILITARY'S HORRIBLE. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS HORRIBLE. EVERYTHING ABOUT AMERICA IS ROTTEN TO THE CORE HE SAYS WITH ALL OF THE AMERICAN FLAGS HE SAID BEHIND HIM, JUST WHAT HE SAID BEFORE HE GOT ELECTED THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM WAS DEAD AND WE WERE IN OUR WORST TIMES. DORIS -- AMERICANS JUST NEVER RESPOND TO THAT NEGATIVITY. THEY WANT SOMETHING DIFFERENT. CAN YOU TELL ME HOW MUCH OF A DEPARTURE LAST NIGHT'S ANNOUNCEMENT WAS FROM ALMOST ANY PRESIDENTIAL ANNOUNCEMENT YOU'VE EVER HEARD, READ OR STUDIED ABOUT?  ABSOLUTELY FLEW IN THE FACE OF WHAT ANNOUNCEMENT SPEECHES ARE SUPPOSED TOING'S SUPPOSED TO HAVE HOPE, EXCITEMENT, HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN, PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT TALKED ABOUT. GEORGE BUSH 43, COMPASSIONATE, CONSERVATIVES AND REPUBLICAN PARTY A NEW VISION. WHEN OBAMA CAME, 8,000 PEOPLE THERE. MUSIC, A SENSE OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE FUTURE. INTERESTING WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WAS, YOU'RE GOING TO BE VERY, VERY HAPPY, BECAUSE I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS GREAT ANNOUNCEMENT. NO JOY IN HIS VOICE THAT NIGHT, LAST NIGHT. NO SENSE OF HIS HAVING ANY FUN. NO SENSE OF MOVING THE COUNTRY FORWARD. A FAILING NATION, DISRESPECTED BY ALL OTHER PEOPLES IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN'T WIN THAT WAY. YOU CAN'T NOT HAVE THAT CONTAGIOUS ENTHUSIASM THAT YOU'VE GOT TO PROJECT. HE USED TO HAVE IT WHEN ARGUING ABOUT THINGS FIRST TIME AROUND. BUT SOMEHOW LAST NIGHT FELT LIKE HE HAD A GIRDLE ON AND SOMEHOW DIDN'T EVEN GO TO THE ELECTION DENIERS.  OOH.  AN INTERESTING IMAGINING, RIGHT? A GIRDLE ON HIM, RIGHT? BUT YOU CAN'T CUT YOURSELF DOWN WITHOUT PROJECTING TO THE COUNTRY YOU'RE EXCITED. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE RUN. WE'RE THE FUTURE, LOOKING HEARD. WHERE MOST ANNOUNCEMENT SPEECHES GO. HISTORIANS WILL LOOK AT THIS, WHERE WAS THIS? WHAT'S GOING ON. > INCREDIBLY DIM VIEW OF THE COUNTRY EXPRESSED BY FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP LAST NIGHT. JOE, I KNOW YOU'LL GET TO JOHN'S OP-ED IN THE \"NEW YORK POST.\" I WANTED TO POINT OUT LOOK AT THE COVER, NO PICTURE OF DONALD TRUMP, YOU MIGHT EXPECT, BUT ON THE BOTTOM SAYS, I THINK WE'LL PUT IT OUT. SIMPLY SAYS \"FLORIDA MAN MAKES ANNOUNCEMENT.\"  OH.  THAT'S THE LINE ON THE COVER.  THEN TO GET TO THE NEWS OF DONALD TRUMP.  WOW.  JUMPING BACK INTO THE RACE, YOU HAVE TO TURN TO PAGE 26 OF THE \"NEW YORK POST.\"  HMM.  SO INTERESTING YOU SAW THAT KIND OF THIN CROWD. A LOT OF CELL PHONES IN THE AIR. HIS DAUGHTER PUT OUT A STATEMENT SAYING THAT SHE'S NOT GOING TO BE IN POLITICS ANYMORE. SO SHE'S OUT. AND I GUESS MIGHT BE WORD ABOUT -- HE DOESN'T HAVE THIS, THE SAME -- IT'S NOT LIKE LAST TIME.  THE DIFFERENCE IS ALSO, YOU HAD DONALD TRUMP BEATING UP MARCO RUBIO, TED CRUZ, RAND PAUL. ALL OF THESE OTHER SENATORS ONSTAGE BACK IN 2016. YOU HAVE RON DeSANTIS NOW WHO WON'T EVEN TAKE THE BAIT.  UH-HUH.  WHO'S ONLY THING -- DeSANTIS IS SAYING, HEY, JUST LOOK AT THE SCOREBOARD. I RAN UP MASSIVE VICTORIES IN MY STATE AND DONALD TRUMP'S CANDIDATES LOST. JUST LOOK AT THE SCOREBOARD. HE'S ACTUALLY PUT HIMSELF ABOVE DONALD TRUMP.  A GOOD POINT. LOOK AT THE SCOREBOARD AND DO IT ALL THE TIME, GO THROUGH ALL ELECTIONS THAT HE'S HELPED REPUBLICANS LOSE, AND THEN SERIOUSLY. ON THE SIGN SAYS, \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\"? BACK TO INSURRECTIONS? I DON'T THINK PEOPLE DO. I THINK PEOPLE FROM ALL SIDES OF THE AISLE -- I DON'T THINK THEY LIKE THAT. THAT'S MY GUT. MY GUT.  AND FROM WHAT I'M GATHERING, REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS, MOST PEOPLE I'M TALKING TO NOW. MANY WHO SUPPORTED DONALD TRUMP, ARE SAYING TIME FOR THE REPUBLICANS TO MOVE FORWARD.  YEAH. SO JOHN, YOUR RECENT OP-ED FOR THE \"NEW YORK POST\" WRITTEN BEFORE TRUMP'S ANNOUNCEMENT IS ENTITLED \"HERE'S HOW DONALD TRUMP SABOTAGED THE REPUBLICAN MIDTERMS.\" YOU RIGHT IN WART THIS, IN ALMOST EVERY PLACE A TRUMPSTER LOST. THERE HAD BEEN A REGULAR REPUBLICAN WHO COULD AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE PARTY'S NOMINEE. A NOMINEE WHO COULD HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNIQUELY HORRIBLE FACTS AND FUNDAMENTALS CONFRONTING DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES IN 2022. BUT THEN TOXIC TRUMP CAME INTO THESE RACES PICKING THE CANDIDATES, CANDIDATE WHO BOWED LOWEST OR AS IN PENNSYLVANIA WENT FOR A SNAKE OIL DOCTOR SALESMAN BECAUSE IT SEEMS HIS WIFE ENJOYED WATCHING MEHMET OZ ON AFTERNOON TV. VOTERS HAVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS. THIS ELECTION WAS NOT ABOUT THEM. NOT TOXIC TRUMP'S INABILITY TO ACCEPT HIS OH FAILURE AND DESPERATE NEED TO ELEVATE CRINGE-INDUCING BOOT LIQUORS PUNISHING POLITICIANS CAPABLE OF AN INDEPENDENT THOUGHT.  AND JOHN, VERY SIMPLE. AS YOU AGREE, A SIMPLE EXERCISE HERE. DR. OZ, McCORMACK IN PENNSYLVANIA AND BLAKE MASTERS IN ARIZONA WITH DOUGDUCEY. THOSE EXAMPLES. THERE'S SO MANY MORE.  THAT PIECE CAME OUT LAST THURSDAY, AND OVER THE WEEKEND, TO THE EXTENT IT WAS SORT OF PROPHETIC, I MEAN, WE HAVE A SYSTEMATIC KIND OF SERIES OF VOTERS DRONE STRIKES ON TRUMP CANDIDATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU KNOW? IN OREGON. IN MICHIGAN. IN -- NEW HAMPSHIRE. YOU HAVE THESE SORT OF TRUMP-ANOINTED PEOPLE WHO WERE TAKEN OUT WHILE IN DISTRICTS THAT REPUBLICANS SHOULD HAVE WON, AND IF YOU ALSO, YOU KNOW, LOOK AT THESE SENATE RACES, AND GOVERNORS' RACES.  MY GOD.  KARI LAKE RAN -- 11 POINTS BEHIND DOUG DUCEY? DOUG DUCEY WON BY 12 OR --  14.  14, EXCUSE ME. SO, YOU KNOW, EVERYWHERE YOU LOOK, VOTERS -- AND THEN, OF COURSE, IN ARIZONA, REPUBLICAN HOUSE CANDIDATES WON WHILE THE THREE PEOPLE AT TOP OF THE TICKET, THE SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDATE, GOVERNOR CANDIDATE AND SENATE CANDIDATE ALL LOST. SO VOTERS WERE NOT BLANKET TAKING OUT REPUBLICANS. THEY WERE TAKING OUT TRUMP-ALIGNED, TRUMP-ENDORSED REPUBLICANS WHOSE MAIN ISSUE WAS STOPPING THE STEAL. AND THAT'S -- IT'S SYSTEMATIC, AND NATIONWIDE, AND THAT MEANS REPUBLICAN VOTERS, THEY MAY NOT HAVE CROSSED THE AISLE TO VOTE. THEY MAY HAVE UNDER VOTED OR NOT COME OUT TO VOTE AT ALL. THEY DIDN'T LIKE THIS. NOW, I WILL SAY THIS, WHICH IS, GOT TO BE CAREFUL HERE. THIS SPEECH WAS NOT FOR US, AND FOR PEOPLE LIKE US. PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER DISAFFECTIVE WITH HIM OR SERIOUSLY ANALYTICAL ABOUT POLITICS, AND I THINK IT'S A MISTAKE TO GO FORWARD THINKING, AH, WE MOVED ON. EVERYBODY'S MOVED ON. LIKE, IN 2015 EVERYBODY THOUGHT THIS WAS SOME KIND OF BIZARRE SIDE SHOW THING GOING ON WITH THE ESCALATOR AND ALL OF THAT AND IT TOOK A MONTH FOR TRUMP TO TAKE THE LEAD IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES AND POLLING, AND HE NEVER SURRENDERED IT AND UNTIL LAST WEEK WHEN THAT FIRST NEW POLL CAME OUT SAYING DeSANTIS WAS TWO POINTS MORE FAVORABLY VIEWED FOR 2024 BY REPUBLICANS THAN TRUMP, THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME SINCE JULY 2015 HE HAS NOT HAD THE ABSOLUTE SUPPORT, NOT ABSOLUTE, BUT NOT HAD THE PLURALITY SUPPORT AND THEN ABSOLUTE SUPPORT OF REPUBLICANS IN A POLL. AND CAN HE GET IT BACK? YES. AGAIN, SORRY TO ANALOGIZE HERE, YOU KEPT SAYING THE SPEECH WAS VERY NEGATIVE, AND IT WAS, BUT IT WAS ALSO A THOROUGH GOING, IT WAS SO LONG. HARD TO PAY ATTENTION TO, BUT THE SYSTEMATIC EFFORT TO TAKE ALL OF THE FUNDAMENTAL FACTS ABOUT THE ECONOMY, AND AFGHANISTAN AND OTHERS AND PUT THEM INTO A PILE AND SAY, YOU KNOW, I AM RUNNING TO STOP WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE OVER THESE TWO YEARS AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE COMING TWO YEARS. HE'S GETTING OUT IN FRONT OF WHAT IS A, WILL BE THE STANDARD REPUBLICAN MESSAGE OF ANY CANDIDATE WHO COMES INTO THE RACE, AND THAT IS THE MESSAGE OF ANYONE WHO IS RUNNING AGAINST AN INCUMBENT. HE SCREWED UP. HE'S DONE THIS, THIS AND THIS. I'M GOING TO COME IN AND RESTORE WHAT WAS LOST. HE CAN SAY RESTORE MYSELF. HE SAID THIS, AND CRAZY STUFF HOW THE COUNTRY WAS IN THE GREATEST SHAPE IN HISTORY AND THEN THEY TOOK IT AWAY FROM HIM, OF COURSE, PREPOSTEROUS SINCE HE LOST IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC.  YEAH, WILLIE, ONE THING QUICKLY. ALSO, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW LONG THIS SPEECH WAS. THERE'S ACTUALLY VIDEO. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE SEEN IT PEOPLE TRYING TO LEAVE WHILE DONALD TRUMP WAS STILL LEAVING, AND SECURITY WON'T LET THEM OUT.  THE SECURITY GUARDS WON'T LET THEM OUT. CROWD PUSHING TOWARDS THE DOOR AND SECURITY GUARDS PUSHING THEM BACK IN TELLING THEM THEY CANNOT LEAVE.  SO HE CAN HAVE CROWD SIZE.  STRAIGHT OUT OF BRONX TALE. YOU CAN'T LEAVE. TURNERS THE LOCK. RIGHT? WON'T LET THEM OUT OF THE PLACE. YOU'RE RIGHT. NO ELECTED OFFICIALS SORT OF CAWTHORN, LOST THIS PRIMARY. ROGER STONE THERE.  IVANKA NOT THERE.  REPUBLICLY SAID WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS NEW CAMPAIGN .  AND SKIPPED THE SPEECH.  TYKE TO PUT DONALD TRUMP IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR. NOT SO EASY AND DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN THAT WAY. YESTERDAY TED CRUZ ON TV SAYING I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP OPTIONS OPEN. IF HE'S THE NOMINEE HE HAS MY FULL SUPPORT. LINDSEY GRAHAM WATCHING THAT SPEECH SAID IF DONALD TRUMP CAN STICK TO THIS TONE AND MAKE THIS KIND OF SPEECH HE'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO BEAT, AND THIS IS THE WAY IT SHOULD BE. YOU START TO SEE THE USUAL SUSPECTS SLOWLY, MAYBE FALLING IN LINE. IS THERE A CHANCE, IF RON DeSANTIS DECIDES HE WANTS TO DO IT, THAT SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE PEEL OFF? THAT THEY DO LEAVE DONALD TRUMP OR CAN THEY JUST NOT QUIT THE GUY?  SURE. I THINK WE HAVE TO SEE WHAT NET EFFECT HE HAS ON THEM. I MEAN, THE REASON THAT EVERYONE GOT AFRAID OF TRUMP IS THAT HE TARGETED INDIVIDUAL POLITICIANS. NOT JUST IN THE PRIMARIES BUT TARGETED SENATOR JEFF FLAKE. TARGETED SENATOR BOB CORKER, BOTH REPUBLICANS, WHO WERE NOT FALLING FOR HIS SCHTICK IN 2017. AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS MADE IT CLEAR TO THEM THAT THEY WOULD NOT WIN IN A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, AND BOTH OF THEM PREEMPTIVELY RETIRED. AND ONE OF THOSE SEATS, FLAKE'S SEAT, ENDED UP GOING TO A DEMOCRAT. YOU CAN SEE HOW TRUMP ENFORCED HIS CONFORMITY BUT AT THE, YOU KNOW, AT A COST TO HIS PARTY. IF IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS NOT HAVING THE SAME OCEANIC EFFECT ON REPUBLICAN-BASE SUPPORT IN 2023, THERE WILL BE A STAMPEDE AWAY FROM HIM. SO MY FRIEND JOHN ELLIS HARKS A FANTASTIC SUBSTACK BASICALLY SAYS, WATCH WHETHER HE RATES ON FOX, ON CNN. HERE, A, IF YOU RUN STUFF OF HIS. FINDING IN 2015-16, PUT HIM ON THE AIR AND RATINGS WOULD DOUBLE. WILL HE RATE? DOESN'T RATE, HE'S FINISHED, IF HE DOES RATE, TED CRUZ AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT ARE NOT GOING TO FLEE FROM HIS SIDE.  INTERESTING, JOE, TOO, THAT HANNITY, TOOK THE SPEECH FOR A WHILE AND AT SOME POINT DECIDED THEY'D SEEN ENOUGH AND CUT AWAY. SCHEDULED FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. WENT WELL OVER AN HOUR, ALL OF HIS SPEECHES DO. AT SOME POINT SEAN HANNITY SAID, OKAY. I THINK WE GOT.  PULLED AWAY, 2025 MINUTES INTO IT. NONE OF THE MAJOR NETWORKS CARRIED IT. NO THINK MSNBC SHOWED IT. NOT SHOWING CLIPS. NOT TO MAKE ANY CLIP, BECAUSE IT'S NOT INTERESTING. HEARD IT ALL BEFORE, AND IT WAS A BUNCH OF GRIEVANCES, A BUNCH OF LIES. REALLY, WHY EVEN PLAY IT? WE --  ESPECIALLY, I MEAN, SO MANY DIFFERENT LEGAL STORIES TO COVER. ALLEN WEISSELBERG FLIPPING AGAINST TRUMP. GETTING INTO THE FRAY AND POSSIBLY DOING SOMETHING TO PROTECT HIMSELF LEGALLY, CREATE A FIRESTORM, CALL IT A WITCH-HUNT. DOESN'T REALLY FEEL LIKE LAST TIME AROUND FOR SURE AND --  THE ISSUE OF RELEVANCE. RIGHT? HOW RELEVANT IS DONALD TRUMP NOW?  WELL, HE'S RELEVANT, BECAUSE --  IN 2015, 2016, HE WAS RELEVANT.  MIDTERMS RESULTS.  AFTER EVERY ONE OF HIS CANDIDATES, OR ALMOST ALL OF HIS CANDIDATES LOSE, AND IT SHOWS THAT HE JUST DOESN'T HAVE POWER. LOOK AT THAT. OF COURSE, WE TALKED ABOUT THE SENATE CANDIDATES HAVE LOST, BUT LOOK AT THOSE HOUSE CANDIDATES. THERE WERE, I BELIEVE, FIVE TO SIX SWING SEAT DISTRICTS THAT DONALD TRUMP ENDORSED. HE WENT 0 FOR 6. THERE IS OF COURSE, AT THE END, JOE KENT, WHO WAS PUT UP, WAS -- AN EXTREME MAGA CANDIDATE, WHO WAS 'SPOS EDSUPPOSED TO REPLACE CONGRESSWOMAN WHO VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP'S IMPEACHMENT. PETER MEYER, ANOTHER PERSON REPLACED BY JOHN, I THINK JOHN GIBBS, I THINK IS HIS NAME.  YEAH.  JOHN GIBBS, A MAN WHO WANTED TO DO AWAY WITH A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO VOTE. HE LOST. IT'S -- LOOK AT THE GOVERNORS THAT DONALD TRUMP SUPPORTED WHO LOST. IT'S AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. HARD TO BELIEVE THAT AFTER LOSING, FOLLOWING TRUMP IN 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 -- AND 2022 THAT THEY WOULD FOLLOW HIM AGAINST IN 2024, BUT IF THEY DO FOLLOW HIM AGAIN IN 2024, THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE WHO WILL BE HAPPY, BECAUSE THEY WILL KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL LOSE YET AGAIN. DORIS, LET'S -- LET'S EXPAND OUR -- OUR VIEW HERE A BIT. A WAY JUST FROM DONALD TRUMP. AWAY FROM THE PRESIDENCY, AND LET ME JUST ASK YOU TO TAKE A A PAST WEEK. IT IS EXTRAORDINARY. WE'VE SEEN EVEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENTS, RONALD REAGAN. IT IS, HIS PARTY GOT BEATEN BADLY IN '82 AND '86. BARACK OBAMA BEATEN TERRIBLY IN 2010, AND 2014. OF COURSE, IT -- IT JUST SEEMED TO HAPPEN HISTORICALLY. IT DIDN'T HAPPEN THIS LAST WEEK. TALK ABOUT -- CAN YOU PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR US HISTORICALLY WHAT WE SAW THIS PAST WEEK?  I THINK WHEN HISTORY LOOKS AT THIS ELECTION, THEY'RE GOING TO START WITH THE FACT THAT WAS N WILLING TO ACCEPT THE LOSS ORIGINALLY IN 2020, AND THEN THE JANUARY 6th ATTACK WAS A WAY OF KEEPING THAT LOSS FROM BEING REAL. AND THEN YOU SEE THE HEARINGS THAT CAME OUT IN THE SUMMER, AND THEY TOLD US WHAT HAD REALLY HAPPENED. PEOPLE KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG. SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH THE KAY KAY-OF- -- CHAOS. ELECTION DENIERS HAD AN EXTRAORDINARY ELECTION WENT AGAINST PEOPLE ATTACKING THEM, WORKED DAY IN DAY OUT. THIS IS OVERALL SENSE OF PEOPLE KNOWING THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG, AND THEY WENT TO THE POLLS. SAID 44% WENT TO THE POLLS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT DEMOCRACY WAS AT ISSUE. WE CAN'T FORGET SOMETHING LARGER THAT HAPPENED THAN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW WITH HIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THEN PRESIDENT BIDEN USED THE BULLY PULPIT TO GIVE DIRECTION. VOTE AGAINST THESE PEOPLE WHO DON'T ACCEPT AN ELECTION AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE MAJOR DENIERS LOST. MEANING THE SYSTEM HELD. I THINK NOW THAT PEOPLE FEEL A SENSE THAT THE SYSTEM HAS HELD, HISTORY'S GOING TO SAY WE CAN MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY THAT WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE CHAOS. THAT MAY NOT BE THERE, CHAOS. PRESIDENT TRUMP DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME POWER HE DID WHEN HE WAS LEADING A GROUP OF PEOPLE SAYING THAT THE WHOLE SYSTEM IS CORRUPT. S SYSTEM PROVED ITSELF THIS TIME. WENT AGAINST PEOPLE'S SHORT-TERM AMBITIONS. EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU GET A GENERATION COMES UP AND YOUNG PEOPLE VOTED IN RECORD NUMBERS, VOTED FOR DEMOCRACY. THAT MEANS WILLING TO PUT THEIR SHORT-TERM NEEDS ABOUT INFLATION AND THE ECONOMY AGAINST THE LARGER-TERM ABSTRACT THING THAT DEMOCRACY MATTERS AND EVERY NOW AND THEN YOU GET A GENERATION, RENDEZVOUS WITH DEFENDANT ANY WITH FDR. JOHN KENNEDY TALKING, DO SOMETHING FOR YOUR COUNTRY AND NOT JUST FOR YOURSELF. IT WAS OBAMA GIVING THAT SENSE OF HOPE FOR THE FUTURE, AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, SOMETHING'S HAPPENED IN THE COUNTRY. THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I THINK YOU NEED TO TAKE A SENSE OF CONTAGIOUS EXCITEMENT FROM THAT, THAT DEMOCRACY WAS ON THE BALLOT, THE PRESIDENT HELPED DIRECTS TOWARDS US AND THE PEOPLE CAME THROUGH. THE REASON, FIRST TIME GOT TO VOTE AFTER 2020, AFTER THE JANUARY 6th, AFTER THE HEARINGS. WERE ON THE BALLOT FINALLY AND THE PEOPLE CAME THROUGH. THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT TODAY. THE CELEBRATION. SYSTEM HELD, PEOPLE VOTED THEIR MINDS. THEY VOTED FOR NOT INFLATION, THEY VOTED FOR THEIR COUNTRY. HISTORY WILL CELEBRATE THAT 50 YEARS FROM NOW, 100 YEARS FROM NOW WHEN I'M NOT AROUND.  THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US, FOR BEING ON THIS MORNING. > AND JOINING US NOW, GEORGIA'S REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE BRAD RAFFENSPERGER IN CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS THIS MORNING AFTER MAKING AN APPEARANCE AT THE HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL INSTITUTE OF POLITICS, AND IT'S GOING TO HAVE YOU ONBOARD THIS MORNING.  MR. SECRETARY, GREAT TO YOU HAVE THERE. GEORGIA, GOING UPTOWN. OKAY. HARVARD. EXACTLY. MR. SECRETARY, MAN, YOU HAVE, YOU HAVE SEEN SOME TWISTS AND TURNS SINCE 2020. LET'S START, THOUGH, BY TALKING ABOUT GEORGIA. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF THE LAWS IN GEORGIA. TALKING ABOUT JIM CROW, 2.0, THAT ATLANTA, LOST THE ALL-STAR GAME BECAUSE A BILL WE HERE ON \"MORNING JOE\" THINK THE MLB DIDN'T EVEN READ. STACEY ABRAMS AND OTHERS WANTED THE ALL-STAR GAME TO BE THERE. A LOT OF CRITICISM. YET LOOK AT NUMBERS THIS PAST WEEK. REMARKABLE. TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW IN GEORGIA?  WELL, WE HAD A RECORD -- WE HAVE JUST A RECORD TURNOUT. IT WAS BIGGER THAN WHAT WE HAD IN 2018. WE HAD SHORT LINES. OUR AVERAGE LINES WAS TWO MINUTES IN THE AFTERNOON. TRACKING AT THREE MINUTES. LONGEST ON LEADERBOARD 14 MINUTES. CHECK-IN TIME, GOT TO THE FRONT LINE, 47 SECONDS. JUST A VERY SMOOTH PROCESS. WE WORKED HARD WITH THE COUNTIES TO KEEP THOSE LINES SHORT. MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOTE. IN GEORGIA, YOU CAN VOTE NO EXCUSE ABSENTEE VOTING 17 DAYS EARLY VOTING AND ELECTION DAY. GAVE VOTERS A CHOICE AND THEY RESPONDED. WE HAD A VERY CALM, SMOOTH, WELL-ATTENDED, YOU KNOW, GOOD TURNOUT ELECTION.  AND WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED WITH THE RUNOFF? THAT'S HAPPENING IN GEORGIA, BETWEEN SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK AND, OF COURSE, HERSCHEL WALKER? WILL THAT GO SMOOTHLY?  YES, IT WILL. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES. IT'S A TIGHTER SCHEDULE. IT'S A FOUR-WEEK RUNOFF PERIOD. BALLOTS SENT AND PEOPLE CAN REQUEST ABSENTEE BALLOTS. THAT'S HAPPENED AND EARLY VOTING STARTS RIGHT AFTER THANKSGIVING, THE MONDAY AFTER. FIVE DAYS EARLY VOTING, ELECTION DAY AND NO EXCUSE ABSENTEE VOTING. WE EXPECT MORE THAN LIKELY HALF THE VOTERS WILL COME BACK TO VOTE. 'S IN A RUNOFF FOUR YEARS AGO AND KNOW ABOUT 1.5, 1.6 PEOPLE SHOW UP. DOWN BALLOT. THIS ELECTION IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT, EVEN THOUGH NOT TO CONTROL THE SENATE. WE'LL PREPARE THE COUNTIES FOR LARGE NUMBERS.  MR. SECRETARY, GOOD MORNING. YOU WON RE-ELECTION AGAIN WITH RELATIVE EASE THIS TIME. DESPITE THE FACT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT IN THAT STATE. OBVIOUSLY, ALL HEARD THE PHONE CALL YOU HAD TO LISTEN TO DONALD TRUMP ASK YOU TO FIND THE VOTES, TO GIVE HIM THE STATE OF GEORGIA IN THE 2020 ELECTION. THE REASON I ASK YOU THAT IS, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE LESSON TO OTHER REPUBLICANS? YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN THROUGH AND THROUGH. YOU'VE SAID BEFORE YOU VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. SUPPORTED HIM, BUT NOT GOING TO GO SO FAR AS TO BETRAY YOUR OATH AND TRY TO FLIP THAT STATE TO DONALD TRUMP. THERE ARE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WHO ARE AFRAID TO STAND UP TO DONALD TRUMP. WHAT IS THE LESSON IN YOUR VICTORY ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN SAY TO DONALD TRUMP AND WHAT YOU CAN STAND UP TO?  WELL, I THINK MITCH McCONNELL HIT IT, HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD SAID CANDIDATE QUALITY. THAT QUALITY TALKING ABOUT CHARACTER, INTEGRITY, BASIC HONESTY AND ABILITY TO HAVE CIVIL DISCOURSE AND THEN QUOTING REAGAN, TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK KINDLY. PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF THE VITRIOL AND WANT PEOPLE TO GET THE JOB DONE AND FOCUS ON THEIR ISSUES. THERE'S A BIG PRAISE FOR THAT AND CANDIDATES THAT RUN IN THAT LANE DID VERY WELL ON ELECTION DAY.  NOW, MR. SECRETARY, TALK ABOUT CONTROVERSY THAT IS BREWING IN GEORGIA ABOUT, I GUESS THIS SATURDAY, HOLIDAY, A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY IT'S A HOLIDAY COMMEMORATING ROBERT E. LEE'S BIRTHDAY, A LINE SIGNED TO CHANGE IN A AND IT IS A GEORGIA STATE HOLIDAY. DIDN'T MAKE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU HAD, I THINK IT WAS NINE WEEKS TWO YEARS AGO. COMPRESSED TO ABOUT FOUR WEEKS NOW. SO DEMOCRATS ARE SAYING WE REALLY NEED THAT DAY. WE'VE BEEN SAYING HERE TIME AND AGAIN IS, IF YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH LAWS, TALK TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE. BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES WHO MAKE THE LAWS. I'M CURIOUS. ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN DO AT THIS LATE POINT TO MAKE VOTING ON SATURDAY AVAILABLE? OR IS IT TOO LATE IN THE PROCESS?  WE HAVE AN INTERPRETATION FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND FOLLOW THEIR DIRECTIVES AND SO REALLY IT'S NEXT SESSION GENERAL ASSEMBLY CANNINGS AND LOOK AS TWEAKS ON ELECTION. FEW LOOKING AT THE SUCCESS WE HAD THIS PAST ELECTION, BUT SOMETHING THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WANTS TO LOOK AT. REALLY WHERE IT HAS TO HAPPEN. POSTELECTION. WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THE LAW. I'VE SHOWN I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THE LAW, FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF LAWS WHICH IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE GIVES CLEAR DIRECTIVES ON WHAT THE LAW IS.  AND FINALLY, HOW IMPORTANT WAS IT THAT SECRETARIES OF STATE ELECTION DENIERS GOT DEFEATED ACROSS AMERICA?  VOTERS SPOKE VERY CLEARLY THEY WANT PEOPLE THAT ARE HONEST, ACCEPT THE RESULTS, ACCEPT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE'S IN GEORGIA WE'VE SEWN WE HAVE HONEST AND FAIR ELECTIONS. MANY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS, EACH STATE HAS DIFFERENT PROCESSES, LOOK HOW FAST OUR RESULTS WERE DONE AND ACCURATE THEY'VE BEEN. WE'RE GOING TO DO AN AUDIT OF THE STATE-WIDE RACE AND SHOW EVERYONE WE HAVE HONEST, FAIR AND ACCURATE ELECTIONS. AND VOTERS, WE WANT THEM TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESS. A LOT OF PEOPLE CASTING DISPERSIONS ON THE PROCESS AND IT'S NOT HELPFUL FOR OUR DEMOCRACY.  NO. GEORGIA'S SECRETARY OF STATE BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, THANK YOU FOR BEING ON TODAY, AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU. > IT'S TIME NOW FOR A LOOK AT MORNING PAPERS.

        "trs": " ONE OF THE BIGGEST DEMOCRATIC UPSETS IN THE MIDTERM CYCLE, PROBABLY THE BIGGEST UPSET THE CYCLE, FULL STOP, CAME IN A WASHINGTON STATE THIRD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, SOUTHWEST PART OF THE STATE. AGAINST ALL ODDS, MARIE GLUESENKAMP PEREZ DEFEATED REPUBLICAN JOE CAN. THIS WAS A SEAT THAT SUPPOSED TO STAY IN REPUBLICAN HANDS AFTER BEING HELD BY A REPUBLICAN FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. IT WAS HELD BY SIX TERM CONGRESSWOMAN, JAIME HERRERA BUTLER. YOU MAY REMEMBER, SHE GAINED NATIONAL ATTENTION LAST YEAR AS ONE OF JUST TEN HOUSE REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED TO IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP FOR INCITING THE INSURRECTION ON JANUARY SIX. CONGRESSWOMAN HERRERA BUTLER ALSO REVEALED DETAILS OF THE PHONE CALL ON THE SIX BETWEEN HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY AND DONALD TRUMP. THAT WAS THE INFAMOUS CHILLING CALL WHEN TRUMP TOLD MCCARTHY THAT MEMBERS OF THE MOB WERE RANSACKING THE CAPITAL, AND ENDEMIC PENCE AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, QUOTE, MORE UPSET ABOUT THE ELECTION THAN YOU ARE. OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP IS FURIOUS WITH JAMIE HERRERA BEUTLER AFTER THE. WHAT DID HE DO? HE BACKED HER PRIMARY CHALLENGER, JOE CANNED, THE 42-YEAR-OLD FORMER GREENBRAE. TO BE CLEAR HERE, JOE KENT IS EXTREME, EVEN FOR A MAGA REPUBLICAN. HE HAS TIES TO WHITE NATIONALISTS, INCLUDING THIS MAN, WHO CALLED ADOLF HITLER, A QUOTE, COMPLICATED HISTORICAL FIGURE, WHICH MEANT PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND. CAMPAIGN PAID A MEMBER OF THE PROUD BOYS CONSULTING FEES. THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE WASHINGTON STATE REPUBLICAN PARTY CALLED CAN'T, AND I QUOTE, THE FREE CASE OF THE MAGA FREAKS. BUT THE WOMAN WHO DEFEATED CAN, MARIE GLUESENKAMP PRESS, WAS JUST ABOUT AS NORMAL AS IT GETS FOR A LACK OF A BETTER DESCRIPTOR. WORKING CLASS BUSINESS OWNER, WHO HAS NEVER HELD OFFICE BEFORE.  I AM NOT YOUR TYPICAL CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS. MY NAME IS MARIE GLUESENKAMP PEREZ. MY HUSBAND BEEN AND I OWN A AUTO REPAIR SHOP. I AM RUNNING FOR BOYS AND GIRLS WHO HAVE A LITTLE CHRISTENED OR THE FINGERNAILS, FOR THOSE STRUGGLING RUNNING SMALL BUSINESSES, TAKING CARE OF YOUNG KIDS AND THINKER OF AGING PARENTS.  -- THAT IS A VERY GOOD ONE. AND A LOT OF WAYS, THAT RACE IN WASHINGTON, THAT IS THE STORY AT A BITTER ELECTION. WE SAW TRUMP BACK EXTREMISTS AFTER EXTREME'S FAILED AS VOTERS CHOSE NORMAL RELATABLE CANDIDATES LIKE GLUESENKAMP FOR US. ON A DEEPER LEVEL, THESE ELECTIONS SHOWED HOW THE EXTREME WAVE OF THE MAGA MOVEMENT, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, BECAME TRAPPED IN THEIR OWN IDEOLOGICAL CHAIN. JOE CLINT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE. LOOK AT THE STREET, IT'S AMAZING. THIS TWEET IS JOKE AND CONDEMNING PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR PASTIME IN AMERICA AS SOME SORT OF, I DON'T KNOW, WE'LL SEE LIBERAL DESTRUCTION. QUOTE, I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE WATCH PRO SPORTS, MAJOR CORPORATIONS WRITING WOKE PROPAGANDA WHILE CONVINCING MEN THAT THE MASK THING TO DO IS WATCH OTHER MEN COMPETE IN A SILLY GAME. I MEAN, LOOK, THERE'S LOTS OF A GENOMIC CRITICISM OF PROFESSIONAL SPORTS AND THE SPORTS LEAGUES, SOME OF WHICH I HAVE, BUT THEY ARE WILDLY POPULAR IN THIS COUNTRY. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST OUT OF TOUCH THINGS A CANDIDATE CAN SAY, PRACTICALLY A DISTRICT OUTLINES RIGHT. AGAIN, IT DEMONSTRATES EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO DONALD TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE MAGA WIND HAS BECOME SO OBSESSIVELY WRAPPED UP IN THEIR OWN TWISTED EGO CHAMBER, THEIR OWN NEUROTIC EXCEPTIONS ABOUT WOKENESS, TRANS YOUTH, THEY'VE COMPLETELY LOST TRUST WITH WHAT NORMAL PEOPLE THINK AND WANT. THIS YEAR, THEY NOMINATED A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO JUST HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH THE MEDIAN VOTER. LOOK AT KARI LAKE, WHO IS PROBABLY THE STRONGEST CANDIDATE AMONG ALL OF THEM, WHO STILL LOST THEIR BID FOR GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA. IN ADDITION TO BEING AN ELECTION DENIER, ANTI-VAXXER, SHE CALLED FOR IMPRISONING HER OPPONENTS AND JOURNALISTS. LOOK AT BLAKE MASTERS, IN THAT STATE AS WELL, THE FIFTH ARIZONA CANDIDATE FOR SENATE. HE REPEATS FAR-RIGHT CONSPIRACIES IN ELECTION LIES. HIS CAMPAIGN ADS VARY FROM STRANGE DIRECT SHOULD BE. THE TWO AND A HALF MINUTE VIDEO THAT READS MORE LIKE A PROMOTION FOR GUN SILENCERS.  MADE IN GERMANY, 007 GUN, WHY WOULD YOU NOT WANT THIS. WITH FLOATED UP AND SEE HOW IT SHOOTS.  SILENCER SOMETIMES GET A BAD RAP. THEY WANT TO PRETEND THAT IT MAKES IT EASY TO COMMIT CRIME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT ACTUALLY, SHOOTING WITH A SILENCER MAKES IT A WHOLE LOT MORE PLEASANT TO SHOOT, BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GIANT AIR PRODUCTION.  YES, THE SOUNDS OF GET A BAD RAP. SOMEONE AT A PARTY SHOWED YOU THAT VIDEO, HEY, YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING COOL? YOU WOULD GET THE HECK OUT THERE. WHO IS THE MEDIAN ARIZONA VOTER THAT WATCHES THAT LIKE, THAT'S WHAT I WANT FOR MY SENATOR. NOT A LOT OF THEM, IT TURNS OUT. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, YOU SAW THIS OUT OF TOUCH EXTREMISM PROJECTED OVER AND OVER. AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, REPUBLICAN SENATE NOMINEE, DON BOLDUC, WHO REPEATEDLY FALSELY CLAIMED THAT CHILDREN ARE IDENTIFYING AS CATS AND USING LITTER BOXES IN SCHOOLS, A WIDELY CIRCULATED MYTH. HE ALSO CALLED AN ASPECT OF FERTILITY DISGUSTING. HE INDICATED HE WAS OPEN TO BEND THE PROCEDURE. I WONDER HOW THAT WENT WITH VOTERS. IN OHIO, THERE WAS JEREMY JUICY, THE MAGA WRAPPING QANON BELIEVING CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS, WHO LIED ABOUT HIS MILITARY SERVICE AND NORTH CAROLINA CANDIDATE BILL HINES, WHO TAKES A COMMUNITY PANEL SHE DECIDED VICTIMS OF RAPE AND INCEST WOULD BE ALLOWED TO GET AN ABORTION. IT IS NOT AN ACCIDENT THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE THE KINDS OF CANDIDATES THAT FLOURISH IN MAGA REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES, THE LITMUS TEST IN DONALD TRUMP'S PARTY IS, DO YOU BELIEVE THE 2020 ELECTION WAS STOLEN BY SOME FANTASTIC CONSPIRACY INVOLVING AND TALLINN SATELLITES AND THE GHOST OF HUGO CHAVEZ? IF YOU BELIEVE SOMETHING THAT IS OBVIOUSLY PREPOSTEROUSLY FALLS, YOU WILL BE A WEIRDO. IT'S NOT SURPRISING MORE INSANITY FOLLOW. THE REAL IRONY IS THAT REPUBLICANS ARE CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT REPRESENT REAL AMERICA. IT'S THOSE OUT OF TOUCH LIBERAL COASTAL ELITES, THEY DON'T GET US. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO LOST THE SAY AT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE UTTERLY OUT OF TOUCH WITH ORDINARY PEOPLE, AND THEY GOT A RUDE AWAKENING LAST NIGHT. THERE'S ONE REASON WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT BATTLE OF CONTROL OF SENATE TONIGHT, THAT'S BECAUSE THE LINE AGAINST ANTI-DEMOCRATIC MAGA FORCES HEALTH IN THE STATE OF NEVADA. JOINING ME NOW IS NEVADA SENATOR, CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO. SENATOR, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON. CONGRATULATIONS ON A VICTORY. WHAT DO YOU TOP UP YOUR WIND?  THANK YOU, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S GOING TO JOIN YOU. TO KNOW THAT IN, EVERY NEVADAN THAT CAME OUT, A HARDWORKING FAMILY, IT WAS THE KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES, THE APPEAL OF ROE V. WADE WHICH IS A PROUD, PRO-CHOICE STATE. IT IS THE BIG LIE, WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY SIX, WAS FUELED BY THE BIG LIE AND THE PEOPLE MEDDLING DISCUSSED BURSARIES IN THE LAST ELECTION. THAT IS PROVEN BY THE COURTS NEVADA THAT IT WAS NOT STOLEN, NOT ALSO FOUGHT. REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE IN NEVADA STOOD UP FOR OUR ELECTIONS AS WELL. I WAS HEARING THAT SO MANY NEVADANS ON THAT ISSUE THE PEOPLE REALLY CARED ABOUT.  YOUR STATE STRIKES ME AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THIS. THIS IS A STATE THAT HAD IN YOUR RACE, A REPUBLICAN WHO WON THE -- REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS BEFORE, IN FACT VERY POPULAR, IT'S NOT A STATE THAT IS OUT OF REACH FOR THE RIGHT STATEWIDE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE BY ANY MEANS. BUT THE TWO BIG LIE CANDIDATES, YOUR OPPONENT ADAM LAXALT AND JIM MARCHAND, RUNNING FOR SECRETARY OF STATE, BOTH LOST AND UNDERPERFORMED IN THAT GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE. YOU THINK THERE'S A LESSON THERE?  I DO, AND THE REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE I HEARD FROM NEVADANS. IT WAS NOT JUST MY PARTY, NOT JUST DEMOCRATS, IT WAS REPUBLICANS AND NON-PARTISANS. IT WAS WOMEN, MEN, IN URBAN AREAS, RURAL AREAS. SO MANY PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW. TO BE HONEST, THIS IS WHAT I LEARNED. I LOVED WHAT HAPPEN UNGENEROUS, BUT SO MANY NEVADANS I SPOKE TO WATCHED IT HAPPEN IN FOUR OF THEIR OWN EYES. THAT WAS EMOTIONAL FOR THEM. THEY WERE OUTRAGED, THEY HAD A MOTION JUST WATCHING IT. SO I WOULD HEAR FROM MANY NEVADANS WHO TALK ABOUT THE PROTECTION OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND WANTED TO COME AND STAND UP FOR IT AND AGAINST THOSE CANDIDATES, FAR-RIGHT EXTREME CANDIDATES THAT WERE CONTINUING TO PEDDLE THE BIG LIE AND CONTINUING TO ERODE OUR RIGHTS, THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  IN TERMS OF THE AND THE AGENDA THAT SENATE DEMOCRATS PURSUED, VOTED FOR AND WAS SIGNED BY JOE BIDEN, HOW MUCH WERE YOU RUNNING ON THAT? WHEN YOU ARE DOING FOCUS GROUPS, LOOKING AT POLLING, RUNNING HER ADS IN A STATE, HOW MUCH OF IT WAS, HEY, HERE'S WHAT I VOTED FOR, AND HERE IS WHAT IT DID?  I WILL TELL YOU, I WAS SENT TO THE SENATE BY NEVADANS TO DO THE WORK THAT I HAVE DONE. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. I WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR YEARS. WHEN I RAN FOR THE SENATE, THERE WERE A NUMBER OF SENIORS THAT WAS LEANING LEFT, AND THEY SAID WE KNOW YOU ARE A PROSECUTOR AND ATTORNEY GENERAL. WE EXPECT YOU TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND PROSECUTE THE CASE TO LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS, TO TAKE ON BIG PHARMA AND MAKE SURE THAT MEDICARE CAN NEGOTIATE TO LOWER COSTS FOR SENIORS. I WAS ABLE TO GO BACK TO THE STATE AND SAY, GUESS WHAT, WE DID IT. WORKING TOGETHER AND THANKS TO SO MANY OTHER, VOICES BEING HEARD, WE WERE ABLE TO NOT ONLY NEGOTIATE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS, WE KEPT THE COST OF INSULIN TO LOWER COSTS FOR SO MANY FAMILIES. I WAS ABLE TO GO BACK AND TALK ABOUT THE, BUT ALSO, PART OF IT WAS ALSO, THIS IDEA THAT INFLATION IS OUT THERE AND IMPACTING ME AND MY FAMILY AND NEVADANS IS CRAZY. I UNDERSTOOD, I WAS JUST AS FRUSTRATED AS NEVADANS ABOUT THE HIGH GAS PRICES, AND QUESTIONING WHY BIG OR WAS AT THE TABLE WORKING WITH US. I WAS JUST FRUSTRATED WHEN YOU GO GROCERY SHOPPING. I GO GROCERY SHOPPING, MY FAMILY DOES, MY MOTHER DOES, I HEAR THE HIGH PRICES. PART OF THIS IS, WHY AREN'T WE ALL WORKING TOGETHER TO LOWER THE COSTS? WHY ARE WE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON HELPING WORKING FAMILIES, THOSE FAMILIES THAT I KNOW IN MY STATE, ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, THESE COST ISSUES. I WAS ABLE TO GO TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT WE HAD DONE ALREADY WITH THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE, THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT, THE CHIPS AND SIGNS ACT THAT WAS BRINGING ALL MANUFACTURING AND CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS IN NEVADA, TALKING ABOUT THOSE JOBS AND UNION JOBS, AND HOW IT IS CONTINUING TO GROW OUR ECONOMY. REMEMBER, THE BIDEN ECONOMY, AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC, WAS DEVASTATING. WE HAD 30% UNEMPLOYMENT. AND THE LAS VEGAS STRIP, IT WAS SHUT DOWN. THAT WAS OUR MAIN REVENUE GENERATOR. WE HAD TO WORK TO COME OUT, AND THEN ALSO HAVE A LONG TERM PLAN TO KEEP US GOING, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD GOOD PAYING JOBS.  I THINK I SAID LAST WEEK, THAT I THINK THE GOVERNOR OF YOUR STATE IT DOESN'T ALWAYS, HAD ARGUABLY THE HARDEST JOB IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF GOVERNORS DURING COVID, TO SHUT DOWN THE TRIP, TO IMPLEMENT THE PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES AND A PLACE THAT IS SET DEPENDENT ON EXACTLY THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES TRAVEL TOURISM, HOSPITALITY, THAT MIGHT BE ON THE SIDE FOR OTHER METRO AREAS OR REGIONS OR STATES. SENATOR KATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO WILL BE JOINING THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY, RETURNING TO WASHINGTON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU.  ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE BEEN SCRAMBLING THINGS AROUND RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE WAS A BLAST IMPLEMENTED A, YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN. POLAND IS A NATO ALLY. THAT BLAST KILLED TWO PEOPLE. IT CAME FROM SOMETHING FROM THE SKY, WE DON'T QUITE KNOW THE DETAILS OF IT. IT COULD'VE BEEN A RUSSIAN ROCKET, COULD'VE BEEN A UKRAINIAN FIRING ON A RUSSIAN MISSILE, BUT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS IN BALI, WHERE HE IS ALREADY MEETING WITH WORLD LEADERS. HE CALLED AN EMERGENCY MEETING, HE QUOTED THE PRESIDENT OF POLAND. WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT DIRECTLY MOMENTARILY, DON'T GO ANYWHERE. 20221116084821.097|20221116085248.464",

        "trs": " IN ORDER TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AND GLORIOUS AGAIN, I AM TONIGHT ANNOUNCING MY CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  WELL, THERE YOU GO AMERICA. DONALD TRUMP MADE IT OFFICIAL. HE IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN. RIGHT NOW CONTROL OF THE HOUSE IS STILL UNDECIDED, BUT DEMOCRATS DID HOLD THE SENATE AND THAT HAS REPUBLICANS IN FIGHTING AND FINGER POINTING OVER WHO IS TO BLAME AND WHO SHOULD LEAD GOING FORWARD. ON THE HOUSE SIDE, KEVIN MCCARTHY'S BID TO BE SPEAKER IS MOVING FORWARD BUT HE FACES SOME SERIOUS CHALLENGES AHEAD AND TODAY, RICK SCOTT SAYS HE WANTS TO TAKE THE SENATE'S TOP REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP JOB AWAY FROM MITCH MCCONNELL. TO DISCUSS, BACK WITH US TONIGHT'S JACQUELINE ALEMANY, CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION REPORTER FOR THE WASHINGTON POST AND EMBASSY CONTRIBUTOR. AND STUART STEVENS IS HERE, A THAT ONE OF THE MITT ROMNEY AND THE THE GEORGE W. BUSH CAMPAIGNS. HE IS NOW WITH THE LINCOLN PROJECT. HIS LATEST BOOK, IT WAS ALL A LIE HOW THE REPUBLICAN BECAME DONALD TRUMP IS A MUST READ. STUART, WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON DONALD TRUMP'S ANNOUNCEMENT? COULD THE TIMING BE ANY WORSE THAN FOR THE GOP?  I THINK DONALD TRUMP IS GOING TO BE A REPUBLICAN NOMINEE. AND, AS MUCH AS WE MIGHT HATED, HE STANDS A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF BEING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HE SHOULD BE TAKEN VERY, VERY SERIOUSLY. I DO NOT KNOW IF ANYONE CAN REALLY DEFEAT HIM IN A PRIMARY, BUT THEY FACE THE REALITY, YOU SAY RON DESANTIS RUN AGAINST BROUGHT DONALD TRUMP MANAGES TO WIN, TRUMP WILL WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY TO WAKE IT TO MAKE SURE YOU NEVER PRESIDENT. THAT IS WITHIN HIS POWER. HE GETS MASTRIANO TO RUN IN PENNSYLVANIA AS AN INDEPENDENT. IF HE GETS IVANKA TO RUN IN FLORIDA, THAT IS PRETTY MUCH IT. YOU CANNOT WIN. YOU GET MASTERS TO RUN IN ARIZONA. SO IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT WEIRD SITUATION FOR SOMEBODY THINKING ABOUT CHALLENGING TRUMP, CERTAINLY IF I WERE TO SAY, IF I WASN'T TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER FOUR YEARS AND TRUMP DID GET ELECTED, HE CANNOT RUN AGAIN AND LAST HE'S COMPLETELY SUSPENDS ALL ELECTIONS, AND HE COULD RUN THEN.  SO YOU MAKE NOTHING OF ALL OF THESE REPUBLICANS, RIGHT WING OUTLETS SEEMINGLY TURNING ON TRUMP? JUST TONIGHT THE NATIONAL REVIEW POSTS A RUDE DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCED NEW PRESIDENTIAL BID ON TUESDAY NIGHT. AN INVITATION TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE OUTRAGEOUS AND FAILURES OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT REPUBLICANS SHOULD REJECT WITHOUT HESITATION OR DOUBT. THAT RIGHT THERE DOES NOT SOUND LIKE AN ENTHUSIASTIC REPUBLICAN PARTY LOOKING BACK AT DONALD.  WELL LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THE NATIONAL REVIEW FAMOUSLY PUBLISHED A FULL COVER STORY, NEVER TRUMP, WITH ALL OF THE RIOTERS WEIGHING IN. LOOK AT LINDSEY GRAHAM'S COMMENTS TONIGHT. HE SAYS THAT IF TRUMP CONTINUES WITH HIS TONE AND THIS MESSAGE, IT WILL BE HARD TO BEAT. THEY WILL ALL FALL IN LINE. THE ONLY REASON WHY PEOPLE ARE CRITICIZING TRUMP IT WAS IN THE ROBOT REPUBLICAN PARTY ARE IT IS BECAUSE THESE CANDIDATES LOST. IT WAS NOT BECAUSE HE TRIED TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES, IT WAS NOT BECAUSE HE TRIED TO SELL OUT THE UKRAINIANS, IT WAS BECAUSE, WELL, YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR CANDIDATES LOST LET'S BLAME TRUMP. THEY WILL FALL IN LINE. THIS IS A VERY WEAK PARTY, IT IS A LITERAL PLATFORM, THE WRITTEN DOCUMENT IS STILL TO SUPPORT WHATEVER DONALD TRUMP WOULD LIKE. THERE IS NO COURAGE TO FIGHT TRUMP IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. IT IS A BUNCH OF COWARDS AND WEAK PEOPLE, AND THEY WILL FALL BEHIND TRUMP.  IT IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT POINT THAT THEY DID NOT TURN ON TRUMP OVER ANYTHING HE SAID OR DIET, IS BECAUSE HIS CANDIDATES LOST. JACQUI, TRUMP IS ALSO A FACTOR ON. CAPITOL HILL RICK SCOTT IS NOW LOOKING TO CHALLENGE MITCH MCCONNELL AND SUPPOSEDLY DONALD TRUMP IS BEHIND THAT. BUT MITCH MCCONNELL SPOKE EARLIER TODAY, HE DOES NOT SEEM WORRIED AT ALL. WATCH THIS.  I THINK THE OUTCOME IS VERY CLEAR I WANT TO REPEAT AGAIN, I WILL BE ELECTED.  HE NEVER SOUNDS WORKED UP OR EMOTIONAL, BUT HE DOES SOUND COOL, COLLECTED AND CONFIDENT. IS HE BLUFFING OR DOES HE HAVE THE VOTES?  I DO NOT KNOW IF HE HAS THE VOTES AT THIS VERY MOMENT, BUT I THINK TOMORROW WHEN THE LEADERSHIP ELECTION HAPPENS, HE IS GOING TO ULTIMATELY BE THE LEADER OF SENATE REPUBLICANS. I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY, MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THESE LEADERSHIP BATTLES AS A PROXY WAR FOR WHO IS GOING TO TAKE THE BLAME. I THINK IT IS REALLY HARD TO SEPARATE RICK SCOTT, WHO IS THE HEAD OF THE CAMPAIGN ARM, THE GOP SENATE, AND SEPARATE THAT FROM THE DISAPPOINTING RESULTS LAST WEEK. ESPECIALLY AS HE HAS SORT OF TRIED TO ATTACH HIM SELF TO FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP WHO IS AGAIN, IS EVEN MORE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STRING OF LOSSES THAT REPUBLICANS GOT HANDED AS A RESULT OF PROPPING UP CANDIDATES THAT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS WERE PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY SAYING SHOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN PAST THE PRIMARY.  RICK SCOTT'S PLAN TO CUT MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND INCREASE TAXES PROBABLY WAS NOT A WINNER EITHER. LET'S TALK ABOUT KEVIN MCCARTHY, THOUGH. HE IS ONE STEP CLOSER TO GETTING HIS DREAM OF BEING SPEAKER. BUT, WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO HORSE TRADE TO GET THAT?  THAT IS THE QUESTION TODAY AS EVERYONE PROBABLY KNOWS. HE WON HIS FIRST BALLOT TO BECOME THE SPEAKER, BUT HE ONLY GOT 188 VOTES OF SUPPORT, NOW HE IS GOING TO HAVE TO GET 2 TO 18, AND THAT IS GOING TO BE A LONG HAUL FOR HIM. WHAT IS HE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE UP IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT SUPPORT? YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MATT GATES, RALPH NORMAN, A BUNCH OF THESE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS TYPES WHO HAVE BEEN VEHEMENTLY AGAINST KEVIN MCCARTHY.  GATES SAID HE WOULD RATHER BE WATER BOARDED BY LIZ CHENEY THEN KEVIN MCCARTHY.  US THAT THERE WERE SOME GOP LAWMAKERS THAT SWORE ON THEIR FIRSTBORN'S LIFE THAT THEY WOULD NEVER SUPPORT HIM FOR SPEAKER. GATES SAYING THAT HE DID NOT HAVE THE VOTES THROUGHOUT THE PAST SIX YEARS, WHY IS HE COIN TO HAVE THEM BEFORE JANUARY? SO, AGAIN, IT'S GOING TO BE SIMILAR TO MCCONNELL. THIS IS A UPHILL BATTLE, IT IS NOT GOING TO BE BIT PRETTY. IT IS GOING TO BE PARTICULARLY GRIM FOR KEVIN MCCARTHY, BUT THERE IS NO ONE ELSE WHO WORLEY WANTS THIS JOB RIGHT NOW, OR CAN EVEN GET 2 TO 18 218 REALISTICALLY. BUT THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS HE GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE UP?  STUART STEVENS, MCCONNELL AND MCCARTHY GETTING THESE JOBS?  I DO NOT THINK MCCARTHY IS. THAT WOULD BE A NORMAL COURSE OF EVENTS, AND THERE IS NOTHING NORMAL ABOUT THIS MOMENT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. HE IS TRYING TO MAKE THESE DEALS WITH PEOPLE WHO DO NOT LIKE HIM, AND HE DOES NOT LIKE THEM. IT'S 49 OR 50 DAYS UNTIL THIS VOTE. THAT IS A LONG TIME. I DO NOT THINK THE GUYS CAN MAKE. IT YOU KNOW, MCCONNELL, HE IS RUNNING AGAINST RICK SCOTT WHO ABSOLUTELY NO ONE LIKES, WHO HE IS POINTED OUT WAS AN ARCHITECT MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE, HE WAS IN THE SENATORIAL COMMITTEE. HOW DID HE DO? I THINK MCCONNELL WILL WIN, IT IS IRONIC THAT MCCONNELL'S ENTIRE CAREER IS ABOUT PACKING THE COURT, LYING ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT NOMINATION PROCESS, PUTTING PEOPLE UP THERE WHO CERTAINLY DECEIVES A PUBLIC ON THE ISSUE OF ABORTION. THAT IS WHY HE IS GOING TO BE THE MINORITY LEADER, MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. BUT, I DO NOT THINK THAT RICK SCOTT, HE IS JUST A WEIRD GUY, IS GOING TO BEAT MCCONNELL.  RICK SCOTT, IF YOU ARE WATCHING, STEWART DOES NOT THINK YOU HAVE IT. JACKIE ALEMANY, STUART STEVENS, THANK YOU BOTH. WHEN WE COME BACK, THE LEGAL CHALLENGES FOR THE NATION'S NEWEST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ARE GETTING WORSE BY THE DAY. BUT DOES ANY THAT MATTER? WE ARE GOING TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHEN THE 11TH HOUR CONTINUES. 20221116073501.064|20221116073515.012",

AND A LOT OF WAYS, THAT RACE IN WASHINGTON, THAT IS THE STORY AT A BITTER ELECTION. WE SAW TRUMP BACK EXTREMISTS AFTER EXTREME'S FAILED AS VOTERS CHOSE NORMAL RELATABLE CANDIDATES LIKE GLUESENKAMP FOR US. ON A DEEPER LEVEL, THESE ELECTIONS SHOWED HOW THE EXTREME WAVE OF THE MAGA MOVEMENT, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, BECAME TRAPPED IN THEIR OWN IDEOLOGICAL CHAIN. JOE CLINT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE. LOOK AT THE STREET, IT'S AMAZING. THIS TWEET IS JOKE AND CONDEMNING PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR PASTIME IN AMERICA AS SOME SORT OF, I DON'T KNOW, WE'LL SEE LIBERAL DESTRUCTION. QUOTE, I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE WATCH PRO SPORTS, MAJOR CORPORATIONS WRITING WOKE PROPAGANDA WHILE CONVINCING MEN THAT THE MASK THING TO DO IS WATCH OTHER MEN COMPETE IN A SILLY GAME. I MEAN, LOOK, THERE'S LOTS OF A GENOMIC CRITICISM OF PROFESSIONAL SPORTS AND THE SPORTS LEAGUES, SOME OF WHICH I HAVE, BUT THEY ARE WILDLY POPULAR IN THIS COUNTRY. THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST OUT OF TOUCH THINGS A CANDIDATE CAN SAY, PRACTICALLY A DISTRICT OUTLINES RIGHT. AGAIN, IT DEMONSTRATES EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED TO DONALD TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE MAGA WIND HAS BECOME SO OBSESSIVELY WRAPPED UP IN THEIR OWN TWISTED EGO CHAMBER, THEIR OWN NEUROTIC EXCEPTIONS ABOUT WOKENESS, TRANS YOUTH, THEY'VE COMPLETELY LOST TRUST WITH WHAT NORMAL PEOPLE THINK AND WANT. THIS YEAR, THEY NOMINATED A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE WHO JUST HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH THE MEDIAN VOTER. LOOK AT KARI LAKE, WHO IS PROBABLY THE STRONGEST CANDIDATE AMONG ALL OF THEM, WHO STILL LOST THEIR BID FOR GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA. IN ADDITION TO BEING AN ELECTION DENIER, ANTI-VAXXER, SHE CALLED FOR IMPRISONING HER OPPONENTS AND JOURNALISTS. LOOK AT BLAKE MASTERS, IN THAT STATE AS WELL, THE FIFTH ARIZONA CANDIDATE FOR SENATE. HE REPEATS FAR-RIGHT CONSPIRACIES IN ELECTION LIES. HIS CAMPAIGN ADS VARY FROM STRANGE DIRECT SHOULD BE. THE TWO AND A HALF MINUTE VIDEO THAT READS MORE LIKE A PROMOTION FOR GUN SILENCERS.  MADE IN GERMANY, 007 GUN, WHY WOULD YOU NOT WANT THIS. WITH FLOATED UP AND SEE HOW IT SHOOTS.  SILENCER SOMETIMES GET A BAD RAP. THEY WANT TO PRETEND THAT IT MAKES IT EASY TO COMMIT CRIME OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BUT ACTUALLY, SHOOTING WITH A SILENCER MAKES IT A WHOLE LOT MORE PLEASANT TO SHOOT, BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GIANT AIR PRODUCTION.  YES, THE SOUNDS OF GET A BAD RAP. SOMEONE AT A PARTY SHOWED YOU THAT VIDEO, HEY, YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING COOL? YOU WOULD GET THE HECK OUT THERE. WHO IS THE MEDIAN ARIZONA VOTER THAT WATCHES THAT LIKE, THAT'S WHAT I WANT FOR MY SENATOR. NOT A LOT OF THEM, IT TURNS OUT. ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, YOU SAW THIS OUT OF TOUCH EXTREMISM PROJECTED OVER AND OVER. AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, REPUBLICAN SENATE NOMINEE, DON BOLDUC, WHO REPEATEDLY FALSELY CLAIMED THAT CHILDREN ARE IDENTIFYING AS CATS AND USING LITTER BOXES IN SCHOOLS, A WIDELY CIRCULATED MYTH. HE ALSO CALLED AN ASPECT OF FERTILITY DISGUSTING. HE INDICATED HE WAS OPEN TO BEND THE PROCEDURE. I WONDER HOW THAT WENT WITH VOTERS. IN OHIO, THERE WAS JEREMY JUICY, THE MAGA WRAPPING QANON BELIEVING CANDIDATE FOR CONGRESS, WHO LIED ABOUT HIS MILITARY SERVICE AND NORTH CAROLINA CANDIDATE BILL HINES, WHO TAKES A COMMUNITY PANEL SHE DECIDED VICTIMS OF RAPE AND INCEST WOULD BE ALLOWED TO GET AN ABORTION. IT IS NOT AN ACCIDENT THAT ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE THE KINDS OF CANDIDATES THAT FLOURISH IN MAGA REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES, THE LITMUS TEST IN DONALD TRUMP'S PARTY IS, DO YOU BELIEVE THE 2020 ELECTION WAS STOLEN BY SOME FANTASTIC CONSPIRACY INVOLVING AND TALLINN SATELLITES AND THE GHOST OF HUGO CHAVEZ? IF YOU BELIEVE SOMETHING THAT IS OBVIOUSLY PREPOSTEROUSLY FALLS, YOU WILL BE A WEIRDO. IT'S NOT SURPRISING MORE INSANITY FOLLOW. THE REAL IRONY IS THAT REPUBLICANS ARE CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT REPRESENT REAL AMERICA. IT'S THOSE OUT OF TOUCH LIBERAL COASTAL ELITES, THEY DON'T GET US. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO LOST THE SAY AT THE FACT THAT THEY ARE UTTERLY OUT OF TOUCH WITH ORDINARY PEOPLE, AND THEY GOT A RUDE AWAKENING LAST NIGHT. THERE'S ONE REASON WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT BATTLE OF CONTROL OF SENATE TONIGHT, THAT'S BECAUSE THE LINE AGAINST ANTI-DEMOCRATIC MAGA FORCES HEALTH IN THE STATE OF NEVADA. JOINING ME NOW IS NEVADA SENATOR, CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO. SENATOR, IT'S GOOD TO HAVE YOU ON. CONGRATULATIONS ON A VICTORY. WHAT DO YOU TOP UP YOUR WIND?  THANK YOU, FIRST OF ALL, IT'S GOING TO JOIN YOU. TO KNOW THAT IN, EVERY NEVADAN THAT CAME OUT, A HARDWORKING FAMILY, IT WAS THE KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES, THE APPEAL OF ROE V. WADE WHICH IS A PROUD, PRO-CHOICE STATE. IT IS THE BIG LIE, WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY SIX, WAS FUELED BY THE BIG LIE AND THE PEOPLE MEDDLING DISCUSSED BURSARIES IN THE LAST ELECTION. THAT IS PROVEN BY THE COURTS NEVADA THAT IT WAS NOT STOLEN, NOT ALSO FOUGHT. REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE IN NEVADA STOOD UP FOR OUR ELECTIONS AS WELL. I WAS HEARING THAT SO MANY NEVADANS ON THAT ISSUE THE PEOPLE REALLY CARED ABOUT.  YOUR STATE STRIKES ME AS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THIS. THIS IS A STATE THAT HAD IN YOUR RACE, A REPUBLICAN WHO WON THE -- REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS BEFORE, IN FACT VERY POPULAR, IT'S NOT A STATE THAT IS OUT OF REACH FOR THE RIGHT STATEWIDE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE BY ANY MEANS. BUT THE TWO BIG LIE CANDIDATES, YOUR OPPONENT ADAM LAXALT AND JIM MARCHAND, RUNNING FOR SECRETARY OF STATE, BOTH LOST AND UNDERPERFORMED IN THAT GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE. YOU THINK THERE'S A LESSON THERE?  I DO, AND THE REASON I SAY THIS IS BECAUSE I HEARD FROM NEVADANS. IT WAS NOT JUST MY PARTY, NOT JUST DEMOCRATS, IT WAS REPUBLICANS AND NON-PARTISANS. IT WAS WOMEN, MEN, IN URBAN AREAS, RURAL AREAS. SO MANY PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THEY SAW. TO BE HONEST, THIS IS WHAT I LEARNED. I LOVED WHAT HAPPEN UNGENEROUS, BUT SO MANY NEVADANS I SPOKE TO WATCHED IT HAPPEN IN FOUR OF THEIR OWN EYES. THAT WAS EMOTIONAL FOR THEM. THEY WERE OUTRAGED, THEY HAD A MOTION JUST WATCHING IT. SO I WOULD HEAR FROM MANY NEVADANS WHO TALK ABOUT THE PROTECTION OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND WANTED TO COME AND STAND UP FOR IT AND AGAINST THOSE CANDIDATES, FAR-RIGHT EXTREME CANDIDATES THAT WERE CONTINUING TO PEDDLE THE BIG LIE AND CONTINUING TO ERODE OUR RIGHTS, THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  IN TERMS OF THE AND THE AGENDA THAT SENATE DEMOCRATS PURSUED, VOTED FOR AND WAS SIGNED BY JOE BIDEN, HOW MUCH WERE YOU RUNNING ON THAT? WHEN YOU ARE DOING FOCUS GROUPS, LOOKING AT POLLING, RUNNING HER ADS IN A STATE, HOW MUCH OF IT WAS, HEY, HERE'S WHAT I VOTED FOR, AND HERE IS WHAT IT DID?  I WILL TELL YOU, I WAS SENT TO THE SENATE BY NEVADANS TO DO THE WORK THAT I HAVE DONE. LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE. I WAS ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR YEARS. WHEN I RAN FOR THE SENATE, THERE WERE A NUMBER OF SENIORS THAT WAS LEANING LEFT, AND THEY SAID WE KNOW YOU ARE A PROSECUTOR AND ATTORNEY GENERAL. WE EXPECT YOU TO GO TO WASHINGTON AND PROSECUTE THE CASE TO LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS, TO TAKE ON BIG PHARMA AND MAKE SURE THAT MEDICARE CAN NEGOTIATE TO LOWER COSTS FOR SENIORS. I WAS ABLE TO GO BACK TO THE STATE AND SAY, GUESS WHAT, WE DID IT. WORKING TOGETHER AND THANKS TO SO MANY OTHER, VOICES BEING HEARD, WE WERE ABLE TO NOT ONLY NEGOTIATE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS, WE KEPT THE COST OF INSULIN TO LOWER COSTS FOR SO MANY FAMILIES. I WAS ABLE TO GO BACK AND TALK ABOUT THE, BUT ALSO, PART OF IT WAS ALSO, THIS IDEA THAT INFLATION IS OUT THERE AND IMPACTING ME AND MY FAMILY AND NEVADANS IS CRAZY. I UNDERSTOOD, I WAS JUST AS FRUSTRATED AS NEVADANS ABOUT THE HIGH GAS PRICES, AND QUESTIONING WHY BIG OR WAS AT THE TABLE WORKING WITH US. I WAS JUST FRUSTRATED WHEN YOU GO GROCERY SHOPPING. I GO GROCERY SHOPPING, MY FAMILY DOES, MY MOTHER DOES, I HEAR THE HIGH PRICES. PART OF THIS IS, WHY AREN'T WE ALL WORKING TOGETHER TO LOWER THE COSTS? WHY ARE WE NOT JUST FOCUSED ON HELPING WORKING FAMILIES, THOSE FAMILIES THAT I KNOW IN MY STATE, ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, THESE COST ISSUES. I WAS ABLE TO GO TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT WE HAD DONE ALREADY WITH THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE PACKAGE, THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT, THE CHIPS AND SIGNS ACT THAT WAS BRINGING ALL MANUFACTURING AND CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS IN NEVADA, TALKING ABOUT THOSE JOBS AND UNION JOBS, AND HOW IT IS CONTINUING TO GROW OUR ECONOMY. REMEMBER, THE BIDEN ECONOMY, AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC, WAS DEVASTATING. WE HAD 30% UNEMPLOYMENT. AND THE LAS VEGAS STRIP, IT WAS SHUT DOWN. THAT WAS OUR MAIN REVENUE GENERATOR. WE HAD TO WORK TO COME OUT, AND THEN ALSO HAVE A LONG TERM PLAN TO KEEP US GOING, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD GOOD PAYING JOBS.  I THINK I SAID LAST WEEK, THAT I THINK THE GOVERNOR OF YOUR STATE IT DOESN'T ALWAYS, HAD ARGUABLY THE HARDEST JOB IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF GOVERNORS DURING COVID, TO SHUT DOWN THE TRIP, TO IMPLEMENT THE PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES AND A PLACE THAT IS SET DEPENDENT ON EXACTLY THE KINDS OF BUSINESSES TRAVEL TOURISM, HOSPITALITY, THAT MIGHT BE ON THE SIDE FOR OTHER METRO AREAS OR REGIONS OR STATES. SENATOR KATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO WILL BE JOINING THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY, RETURNING TO WASHINGTON, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THANK YOU.  ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE BEEN SCRAMBLING THINGS AROUND RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THERE WAS A BLAST IMPLEMENTED A, YOU MIGHT HAVE SEEN. POLAND IS A NATO ALLY. THAT BLAST KILLED TWO PEOPLE. IT CAME FROM SOMETHING FROM THE SKY, WE DON'T QUITE KNOW THE DETAILS OF IT. IT COULD'VE BEEN A RUSSIAN ROCKET, COULD'VE BEEN A UKRAINIAN FIRING ON A RUSSIAN MISSILE, BUT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN IS IN BALI, WHERE HE IS ALREADY MEETING WITH WORLD LEADERS. HE CALLED AN EMERGENCY MEETING, HE QUOTED THE PRESIDENT OF POLAND. WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM THE PRESIDENT DIRECTLY MOMENTARILY, DON'T GO ANYWHERE. N'T GO ANYWHERE. 20221116014925.828|20221116015250.734",

        "trs": "ON WHO WILL CONTROL THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, THE TWO PARTIES ARE HEADING INTO RADICALLY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS ON CAPITOL HILL TODAY. ON ONE HAND APPLAUSE FROM INSIDE THE HOUSE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS THIS MORNING, ACCORDING TO REPORTING FROM JAKE SHERMAN, BETTER THAN EXPECTED MIDTERM SHOWING HAS DEMOCRATS ENERGIZED, AND CURTAIN NUMBER TWO, REPUBLICANS EXPECTED TO HOLD A NARROW MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE, VOTED TODAY ON LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AFTER PREDICTING A RED WAVE AND NOT SEEING SO MUCH AS A TRICKLE AFTER A DEMORALIZING MIDTERM, KEVIN McCARTHY FACED A CHALLENGE FROM THE PARTY'S RIGHT FLANK. HE DID END UP WINNING. STILL, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS IN THE PROCESS OF, SHALL WE SAY, TAKING A QUICK LOOK IN THE MIRROR. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WILL RESULT IN. JOINING US ERIC SWALWELL OF CALIFORNIA. FIRST, CONGRESSMAN, YOU WERE A VOICE ON WHAT VOTERS REALLY SEEMED TO COME OUT AND RESPOND TO AND THAT WAS A CALL TO PROTECT OUR VERY DEMOCRACY. TELL ME HOW YOU ARE FEELING ONE WEEK AFTER THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.  FEELING VERY GOOD, NICOLE. THE VOTERS CLEARLY REJECTED CHAOS. THAT'S WHAT THE REPUBLICANS RAN ON. AND THEY AWARDED COMPETENCE. WE RAN ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, THE C.H.I.P.S. ACT, THE RESCUE PLAN, AND THAT FRAMEWORKED IN OUR DIRECTION. IT WAS REALLY A WIN FOR DEMOCRACY. AND THEN WE HAD THIS OTHER FRAME OF WE CAN BE A COUNTRY THAT PICKS ITS LEADERS BY VOTING OR WE CAN BE A COUNTRY THAT PICKS ITS LEADERS BY VIOLENCE. THE REPUBLICANS WERE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH VIOLENCE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. SO THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN. REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE MAJORITY LANDS, WE BEAT EVERY SINGLE EXPECTATION THAT WAS OUT THERE AND THE REPUBLICANS LAID AN HISTORIC EGG.  AN HISTORIC -- EGG WASN'T I WOULD HAVE GUESSED. INDEED. WE HAD A CONVERSATION AHEAD OF THE ELECTIONS IN THE WAKE OF THE BRUTAL ATTACK AGAINST PAUL PELOSI, SPEAKER PELOSI'S HUSBAND HUSBAND, AND THE RESPONSE AND HOW DIFFERENT IT WAS FROM WHEN SKEEF STEVE SCALISE WAS SHOT AND THERE WAS CONDEMNATION OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE MOTIVATED BY IDEOLOGY. NOT SO WHEN PAUL PELOSI WAS ATTACKED BY A HAMMER. A LOT WERE JOKING ABOUT IT. KARI LAKE WAS MAKING JOKES TO A CROWD. THE CROWD LAUGHED. YOU HAVE BEEN THE TARGET OF A LOT OF POLITICAL THREATS, THREATS OF VIOLENCE AND ASSASSINATION. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THE REJECTION? DO YOU FEEL LIKE IT WAS A REJECTION OF THIS LOOSE TALK AND INCITEMENT OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND DO YOU FEEL LIKE THAT'S GOOD OR IS THERE MORE TO DO? JUST WEIGH IN ON THAT.  THE VOTERS REJECTED VIOLENT RHETORIC. WE SEE IT FROM REPUBLICANS, BUT THAT WAS ON THE BALLOT. AND ANDY BIGGS, WHO RECEIVED 33 VOTES TODAY IN THE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE RUNNING AGAINST KEVIN McCARTHY, HE MADE ONE OF THE WORST JOKES ABOUT SPEAKER PELOSI AND HER HUSBAND JUST A WEEK AGO. IN CONTRAST TO EVERY DEMOCRAT AT THE CONGRESSIONAL BASEBALL GAME A DAY AFTER STEVE SCALISE WAS SHOT, HAVING CONDEMNED THE VIOLENCE AND WEARING HIS LSU IN SOLIDARITY WITH HIM, IT'S A CRUEL, VILE LOT. AND IT GOES TO THE TOP. THE VOTERS REJECTED THAT VILE RHETORIC FROM REPUBLICANS AND ITS LEADER. EVERY EXIT POLL SHOWED DONALD TRUMP AT 55 TO 60% UNDERWATER. IF THEY WANT TO DOUBLE DOWN ON CRAZY, YOU CAN LEAD A COLT IN AMERICA, BUT IN A DEMOCRACY IF YOU LOSE THE HOUSE IN 2018, YOU LOSE THE WHITE HOUSE IN THE SENATE AND '20 AND DON'T TAKE BACK THE SENATE AND YOU FAIL TO MEET EXPECTATIONS IN THE HOUSE, YOU'RE A LOSER. AND DONALD TRUMP IS A LOSER AND THEY ARE GOING TO GO ALL IN WITH A LOSER AND I THINK AMERICANS JUST WANT US TO GET THINGS DONE.  YOU ARE CLOSING, YOUR CLOSING AD WAS SORT OF TYING THESE THINGS TOGETHER ANCHORED BY THE DODD DECISION OVERTURNING A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT WOMEN IN AMERICA HAVE ENJOYED FOR 50 YEARS. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT PLAYED AND WHAT IS THE PLAN GOING FORWARD TO TRY TO PROTECT WOMEN'S ACCESS TO ABORTION HEALTH CARE?  WELL, CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR THEM. LOOK AT HERE STATES WHERE WE CAN CODIFY IN THOSE STATES. THAT TURNED OUT VOTERS IN HISTORIC WAYS. BUT ALSO TO REWARD AND GIVE AGENCY TO GENERATION-Z. WE HAVE MAXWELL FROST NOW IN CONGRESS, A 25-YEAR-OLD WHO WAS A FOUNDER OF MARCH FOR OUR LIVES, MAKE SURE WE REWARD THAT GENERATION AND BRING THEM TO THE TABLE ON THE ISSUES THEY CARE ABOUT OF CLIMATE JUSTICE, RACIAL EQUALITY, ENDING GUN VIOLENCE, HEALTH CARE EQUITY. WE CAN'T IGNORE THEM. OTHERWISE, THEY WILL WALK AWAY.  CONGRESSMAN, DO YOU SPEND A LOT OF TIME HELPING US UNDERSTAND THE THINGS THAT DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING FOR, THE VARIOUS INVESTIGATIONS IN DONALD TRUMP. WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF HOW WE SHOULD COVER HIS ANNOUNCEMENT TONIGHT SHOULD HE ANNOUNCE ANOTHER RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE?  WELL, NICOLE, IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHO SHOWS UP, RIGHT? WHO IS STILL ALL IN WITH A THREE-TIME LOSER, TWICE IMPEACHED WITH INVESTIGATIONS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, BOTH CIVIL AND CRIMINAL. WHO WANTS TO, AS I SAID, TRIPLE, QUADRUPLE DOWN ON THAT BET? BUT I REALLY DO BELIEVE RIGHT NOW IT IS TO QUOTE CHURCHILL, MAY NOT BE THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF TRUMPISM, BUT PROBABLY THE END OF THE BEGINNING. AND I WELCOME AND HOPE THAT A RESPONSIBLE REPUBLICAN PARTY RISES OUT OF THIS. BUT WATCH THE HOUSE BECAUSE I BELIEVE IF KEVIN McCARTHY DOES FIND HIS WAY INTO THE SPEAKERSHIP, HE WILL LEAD THE LAND OF MISFIT TOYS. IT WILL BE A VESSEL STATE AND IT WILL FORM THE LARGEST LAW FIRM IN WASHINGTON, D.C., WITH JUST ONE CLIENT. AND THEY ARE NOT GOING TO FIGHT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE ONE CLIENT AND THEY ARE GOING TO LITIGATE ALL OF HIS GRIEVANCES FROM THE BORDER TO HUNTER BIDEN TO THE FBI TO ATTACKING TRANS KIDS AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE NO OTHER AGENDA AND DO IT FOR SOMEBODY WHO 60% OF THE POPULATION VIEW UNFAVORABLE.  THAT'S THE WHOLE THING, RIGHT? THEY RAN ON ALL THAT STUFF. THAT IS WHAT THEIR CANDIDACIES WERE ABOUT. VOTERS REJECTED IT. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT. I WAS IN THE PARTY. WE DON'T REJECT. WE DOUBLE DOWN ON WHAT DIDN'T WORK AND THAT'S HOW TRUMP HAPPENED. HOW DO YOU -- WHAT DO YOU DO? WHAT DO DEMOCRATS DO IN RESPONSE?  AGAIN, GOVERN RESPONSIBLY IN THE SENATE, CONFIRM JUDGES WHO WILL FOLLOW THE RULE OF LAW, MAKE SURE WE HAVE A CABINET THAT CAN SUPPORT THE EFFORT IN UKRAINE AND BE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND THINK DEMOCRATS WILL FIND A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS WHO BARELY, YOU KNOW, BY THE SKIN OF THEIR TEETH WERE RE-ELECTED WHO ARE GOING TO WANT TO WORK WITH US, A COALITION OF THE RESPONSIBLE. I SAW DON BACON YESTERDAY FROM OMAHA BARELY WON THERE, SAYING IF WE ARE GOING DOWN THE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE CRAZY TRAIN, TAKE ME OFF, COUNT ME OUT. I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE AND THEY'RE HEADING.  THAT IS SO INTERESTING, CONGRESSMAN ERIC SWALWELL CONGRATS ON LAST WEEK'S WINS. THANK YOU FOR SPENDING TIME WITH US TODAY. > UP FOR US, CHUCK SCHUMER WITH AN INTERESTING PROPOSITION ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT THE CONGRESSMAN IS TALKING ABOUT. WE'LL SHOW IT TO YOU NEXT.

        "trs": "> HI, AGAIN, EVERYONE. IT IS 5:00 IN NEW YORK. WE'RE CONTINUING WITH OUR COVERAGE OF THE BREAKING NEWS OUT OF POLAND. HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW AT THIS HOUR. RUSSIAN MISSILES HIT A POLISH TOWN JUST FOUR MILES OVER THE UKRAINIAN BORDER. TWO PEOPLE WERE KILLED. POLAND AND THE NATO ALLIES ARE TRYING TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE MISSILES WERE FIRED BY MISTAKE OR INTENTIONALLY. WHICH WOULD RAISE FEARS THAT THIS WAS AN ESCALATION BY RUSSIA IN ITS WAR AGAINST UKRAINE. ACCORDING TO A POLISH GOVERNMENT SPOKESPERSON, POLAND HAS DECIDED TO, QUOTE, INCREASE THE READINESS OF SOME MILITARY UNITS AND OTHER UNIFORMED SFRSS AND ACCORDING TO REUTERS, THEY ANNOUNCED THEY ARE CONSIDERING WHETHER TO ACTIVATE NATO'S ARTICLE FOUR WHERE THEY BRING AN ISSUE OF CONCERN BEFORE THE NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL. THEY ARE AWARE OF THE INFORMATION BUT CAN INTO THE CONFIRM THE REPORTS OR DETAILS. A PENTAGON SPOKESPERSON SAID WE DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR SECURITY COMMITMENTS AND ARTICLE FIVE WE HAVE BEEN CRYSTAL CLEAR WE WILL DEFEND EVERY INCH OF NATO TERRITORY. TODAY RUSSIA LAUNCHED AIR STRIKES ON CITIES ALL ACROSS UKRAINE. DESCRIBED AS TERRORIST ATTACKS FORCING WIDESPREAD BLACKOUTS THAT LEFT MILLIONS OF UKRAINIANS WITHOUT POWER. IN A STATEMENT, RUSSIA DEFENSE MINISTRY DENY THEY TARGETED POLAND CALLING THE REPORTS A DELIBERATE PROVOCATION. IT IS WHERE WE BEGIN OUR COVERAGE THIS HOUR WITH KELLY O'DONNELL. SHE'S LIVE IN BALI. WHERE SHE'S TRAVELING WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN. ALSO JOINING US COLONEL ALEXANDER VINDMAN, THE FORMER DIRECTOR FOR EUROPEAN AFFAIRS FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL. KELLY, I UNDERSTAND THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS SPOKEN TO PRESIDENT DUDA OF POLAND. TELL US WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM YOUR SOURCE THIS IS HOUR?  Reporter: GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. WE'RE 13 HOUR AS HEAD HERE IN BALI, SO IT IS 6:00 IN THE MORNING. AND WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS ON THE PHONE WITH PRESIDENT DUDA OF POLAND AND THAT CALL CONCLUDED ABOUT 30 MINUTES AGO. OFFICIALS DIDN'T GIVE US A START TIME. BUT WE KNOW THAT WE WERE TOLD AROUND 5:00 A.M. LOCAL TIME THAT THAT CALL WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. SAND PRIOR TO THAT, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN MADE A CALL TO HIS COUNTER PART IN POLAND THAT LAYS GROUNDWORK FOR HOW THESE THINGS GO. SO AT THIS POINT THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT, LEAD TORE LEADER CONTACT AND THAT MAY IMPORT MORE INFORMATION TO PRESIDENT BIDEN ABOUT WHAT DOES PRESIDENT DUDA KNOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON THE GROUND, WHAT MIGHT HIS EXPECTATIONS OR REQUESTS OF PRESIDENT BIDEN, WHAT MIGHT THOSE LOOK LIKE. AND WE KNOW THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN AND PRESIDENT DUDA HAVE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION. THEY HAVE BEEN IN PERSONAL CONTACT OVER THE UKRAINE WAR THROUGHOUT THESE MANY MONTHS. AND PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS OFFERED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT, THINGS LIKE ADDING US FORCES TO FORTIFY THE EASTERN FLANK OF NATO IN POLAND. ALSO ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THE FLOW OF REFUGEES INTO POLAND. REALLY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN UKRAINE THAT MAYBE AMERICANS DON'T HAVE AS MUCH OF A SENSE OF. IF YOU'RE LIVING IN POLAND AND YOU'RE NEAR THE BORDER, A PLACE THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS VISITED PERSONALLY AND IN THE EARLIER MONTHS OF THIS YEAR, IT IS A VERY HEIGHTENED SENSE OF AWARENESS THAT THIS KIND OF INCIDENT COULD HAPPEN. WELL HERE WE ARE. WHERE PRESIDENT BIDEN IS MEETING WITH G 20 LEADERS INCLUDING NOT VLADIMIR PUTIN, WHO DID FLOT COME, BUT HIS FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV WHO HAS BEEN HERE AS PART OF THE NEGOTIATIONS AN TALKS AND THE TYPICAL COMING TOGETHER OF WORLD LEADERS. IT IS AWKWARD AND DIFFICULT AS IT IS GIVEN WHERE RUSSIA IS ON THE WORLD STAGE RIGHT NOW. PRESIDENT BIDEN WANTED TO KEEP THE ALLIANCES STRONG AND TO TRY TO PUSH SOME OF THE NATIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN AS INVOLVED IN SUPPORTING UKRAINE. THIS MAY CHANGE THINGS. AND CERTAINLY THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT SUPPORTING ANY NATO COUNTRY AND NOW WE'RE IN THAT WINDOW OF TIME OF TRYING TO ASSESS WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT KINDS OF CONSEQUENCES SHOULD FOLLOW ONCE THEY HAVE THE FACTS.  KELLY, THE RUSSIANS ARE TOO SINISTER FOR COINCIDENCES. WHAT IS THE WHITE HOUSE ASSESSMENT ON THE TIME OF THIS, IF IT IS AN ACCIDENTAL STRIKE IN POLAND. THE EXTRAORDINARY COINCIDENCE OF AN ACCIDENTAL, THE FIRST OF THIS EIGHT-MONTH WAR STRIKE ON POLAND HAPPENING AS PRESIDENT BIDEN SITTING WITH WORLD LEADERS AT THE G 20.  WELL ONE OF THINGS THAT A SENIOR OFFICIAL SAID WHEN THEY LOOK AT TRYING TO ASSESS WHAT HAPPENED HERE, THE RECOGNITION THAT RUSSIA HAS HAD A POOR RECORD OF PRECISION IN HOW IT IS CARRIED OUT ITS STRIKES. WE'VE SEEN THAT PLAYING OUT. AND THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE HAD MANY FAILED OPERATIONS MILITARILY AND THEY HAVE STEPPED UP THEIR STRIKES AND TRYING TO PUT MORE PRESSURE, PRYING TO CAUSE FEAR AND UNREST AND REAL TENSION AMONG ALLIES ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN, WHAT MORE COULD COME. AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER THEIR MUNITIONS, IF THEY DON'T HAVE OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES LIKE WE MIGHT BE MORE ACCUSTOMED TO IN THE WEST, AND OF COURSE WAR IS OFTEN FRAUGHT WITH MISTAKES. IF THAT IS WHAT THIS IS, AND AGAIN WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL, WE DON'T HAVE ALL OF THE FACTS, THEN U.S. OFFICIALS SAY IT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISING THAT RUSSIA COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AN ERRANT STRIKE. THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED AND ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT UKRAINIAN HAS WANTED IS MORE SUPPORT TO PROTECT ITS SKIES. THAT IS A BIG PART OF THE DIALOGUE. WHAT KINDS OF CAPABILITIES HAS THE U.S. AND OTHER ALLIES BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM TO TRY TO KNOCK DOWN MISSILES TO TRY TO INTERCEPT AND SO FORTH AND AS UKRAINE HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE AT DOING THAT, THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE MUNITIONS IN THE AIR GO PLACES THEY'RE NOT INTENDED TO GO. SO A BIG QUESTION WILL BE WHAT DO ALLIES HERE SEE AS THE LIKELY CONSEQUENCES OF THIS. IF RUSSIA IS CULPABLE, WHETHER IT WAS INTENTIONAL OR INADVERTENT, RUSSIA WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAR IT IS CONDUCTED. AND THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER CONSEQUENCES THAT LEADERS HERE ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STRIKE. THE CONCERN ABOUT ENERGY AND FOOD INSECURITY, AS COLDER MONTHS ARE COMING. A WAR HAS WORN DOWN THE HEARTS AND MINDS AND SOULS OF MANY AROUND THE WORLD FOR THE COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN EXACTED BY THIS. THE FRUSTRATION THAT WORLD LEADERS FEEL WHEN THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE DEALING WITH OTHER ISSUES AND OF COURSE THE INFLATION AND THE ENERGY COSTS THAT HAVE SOARED AS CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING. BUT THIS INCIDENT COULD BE ONE OF THOSE TURNING POINTS THAT CHANGES SOME OF THE CONVERSATION. NICOLLE.  KELLY O'DONNELL, 6:00 A.M. THERE, I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN ON THE AIR SINCE THE 2:00 A.M. HOUR THERE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SPENDING THIS TIME WITH US, KELLY. > COLONEL VINDMAN, LET WE FOLLOW YOU. I FOLLOWED SOME OF YOUR TWEETS. BUT MAKE ME THROUGH YOUR ASSESSMENT OF WHAT HAS TRANSPIRED IN POLAND?  YEAH, SO FIRST, WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW UNFOLD IS THAT CAREFULLY CHOREOGRAPHED MANAGEMENT BY THIS ADMINISTRATION, THEY'RE GETTING QUITE GOOD AT THIS BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CRISES AND THEY'RE TRYING TO MAINTAIN THEIR OPTIONS. SO THIS COULD BE AN ACCIDENT. THE RUSSIANS HAVE BEEN BAD AT THE WAY THEY EXECUTE THESE KIND OF OPERATIONS. THIS WOULD BE CAVALIER, A FIRE THIS CLOSE TO THE BORDER WITH A LIKELIHOOD POSSIBILITY OF A CROSSING INTO POLAND. TO ME THIS IS A SLOW -- WATCHING A TRAIN WRECK IN REALTIME. KNOWING THAT THIS WOULD HAPPEN IN A MATTER OF TIME. A LONG WAR IS A DANGEROUS WAR, IN A WAR IN WHICH THESE KIND OF SCENARIOS UNFOLD WHETHER BY ACCIDENT OR BY INTENT AND NOW WE'VE HAD ONE AND THE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THE ADMINISTRATION DO? DOES IT SHRUG IT OFF AND SEND A SIGNAL TO RUSSIA THAT IN THE FUTURE THEY COULD POTENTIALLY TAKE THIS KIND OF ACTION INTENTIONALLY AND PROBE FOR VULNERABILITIES, OR DOES THE ADMINISTRATION TAKE A VERY MEASURED THOUGHTFUL, THIS IS NOT A NECESSARILY A SYMMETRIC RESPONSE, THIS IS NOT ONE THAT WARRANTED DIRECT U.S. OR NATO MILITARY ACTION, BUT DO THEY OFFER A SIGNIFICANT SIGNAL IN RESPONSE. AND COUNTER THIS KIND OF POTENTIAL ESCALATION, THAT IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND THAT IS WHY I THINK WE'RE LIKELY TO GET TO AN ARTICLE FOUR SCENARIO IN WHICH THERE IS A CONSULTATION OVER A THREAT TO AN ALLY AND THEN SOME ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO UKRAINE AND MAYBE SOME HARDENING OF THE BORDER IN NATO'S EASTERN PLANK.  COLONEL, IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE TIMING THAT TO YOU IS CURIOUS OR THAT YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT?  SURE. THERE IS MULTIPLE -- THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS COINCIDENCES WITH REGARD TO RUSSIA. TO ME THE TIMING IS TELLING. THEY CONDUCTED A VERY LARGE BARRAGE OF A HUNDRED SYSTEMS, DRONES AND CRUISE MISSILES RIGHT AFTER ONE OF THE KEY MEETINGS IN G 20. THEY WANT THIS TO BE AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA AND PRESSURE TO BUILD AND TO RESULT IN SOME SORT OF COERCION OF UKRAINE OR STEMMING THE SUPPORT TO UKRAINE. IT ALSO IS ON THE HEELS OF THE MIDTERM ELECTION. IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAVING GRACE OF THE WAR GETTING SOMETHING THROUGH A REPUBLICAN TAKE OVER IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE THAT THEY COULDN'T ACLEAVE POTENTIALLY ON THE GROUND THROUGH MILITARY MEANS AND HAVING FAILED TO MISCALCULATE ON THE FACT THAT THE ELECTIONS WERE NOT GOING IN THEIR FAVOR, THIS IS A WAY TO RATCHET UP THE PRESSURE. I TEND TO THINK THAT RUSSIAS ARE RATHER INTENTIONAL WITH SOME OF THESE THINGS. THIS IS NOT A TACTICAL DECISION. THIS IS A OPERATIONAL OR STRATEGIC SYSTEM THAT WAS DEPLAYED BY SENIOR LEADERSHIP UP THE CHAIN AND INCLUDING THE SELECTION OF THE TARGETS. SO I THINK THERE IS SOME PERCEPTION OF INTENTIONALALITY, BUT IT IS AN ATTACK ON -- OR IT IS AN INCIDENT THAT WARRANTED A SIGNIFICANT RESPONSE.  COLONEL VINDMAN, IT COMES ON THE HEELS OF THIS BRUTAL BLOW FOR RUSSIA IN KHERSON. IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THE CRUSH OF DEFEAT, THAT CAME RIGHT BEFORE -- PRECEDED THE MIDTERMS NOT GOING THE WAY WE KNOW VLADIMIR PUTIN WOULD HAVE HOPED THEY WENT BECAUSE A REPUBLICAN FLIRTATIONS WITH CUTTING OFF MILITARY AND HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE FOR UKRAINE. JUST TAKE A STEP BACK EVEN FURTHER AND TALK ABOUT THIS MOMENT IN THE WAR.  SO, I THINK WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT WHENEVER RUSSIA HAS A MAJOR REVERSAL ON THE BATTLEFIELD, TO LASH OUT WITH WHATEVER MEANS THEY HAVE AVAILABLE. AND THEY'RE KIND OF A ONE-TRICK PONY WITH REGARDS TO CRUISE MISSILES AB SOME DRONES THAT ARE INEFFECTIVE. THEY'VE DONE THIS MASSIVE BARRAGE OF MISSILES AFTER THE STRIKE ON THE BRIDGE. THEY DID IT AGAIN HERE AFTER KHERSON TO INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE SOME TEETH AND THEY COULD TAKE SOME ACTION. I THINK WE SHOULD NOT KIND OF JUST LOOK AT THIS INS ACCIDENT IN A VACUUM. WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF ABOUT WHAT WE NOW ABOUT THE WAY THE RUSSIANS OPERATION. THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO POTENTIALLY INCREMENTALLY ESCALATE AND INDICATE THAT THEY STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO BREAK QUITE A BIT OF DAMAGE AND THAT THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR SPILLOVER. AND IN THAT CONTEXT, I THINK THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT THE RUSSIANS COULD BE SIGNALING HERE. WITH PLAUSIBLE DENIABILITY THAT THIS IS AN ACCIDENT BUT THIS IS THE WAY THE WAR COULD GO AND SPILL OVER INTO NATO AND THUS FORCING THE WEST AND THE NATO IN GENERAL TO START TO MAYBE APPLY SOME ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON UKRAINE. THAT IS THE TRACK THAT THEY'RE POTENTIALLY LOOKING TO EXPLOIT HERE.  ALEXANDER VINDMAN, I WAS RIVETED BY YOUR TWEETS AND THANK YOU FOR SPENDING TIME WITH US ON THIS. WE'LL CONTINUE TO CALL ON YOU. > AHEAD FOR US, JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE VICE CHAIR LIZ CHENEY ON THE FUTURE OF THAT COMMITTEE'S WORK AFTER THE TWICE IMPEACHED EX PRESIDENT DEFIED THE PANEL SUBPOENA THIS WEEK. > PLUS WHAT IS NEXT FOR ABORTION RIGHTS IN AMERICA AFTER WOMEN AND YOUNG PEOPLE PROPELLED DEMOCRATS TO VICTORY IN A REBUKE OF THE DOBBS DECISION AND THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT CURRENT MAKEUP. THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS SHOW THAT AMERICAN VOTERS WANT THEIR RIGHTS PROTECTED AND RESTORED BUT DEMOCRATS CAN'T AND WHAT THEY SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT DO FOR THAT. AND THE PEOPLE THAT KNOW THE ANSWERS TO ALL OF THOSE QUESTIONS IS COMING UP AFTER A BREAK. > AND THE BATTLE GROUND STATE CANDIDATE WHO RAN ON THE BIG ISSUES OF ABORTION RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY AND WON AND WON BIG.

        "trs": "> THEY'VE COMPLETED THEIR PUBLIC HEARINGS. THEY HAVE SUBPOENAED THE TWICE IMPEACHED EX PRESIDENT FOR HIS TESTIMONY AND NOW THE MEMBERS OF THE JANUARY 6 HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ARE BEGINNING TO WRAP UP THEIR WORK. VICE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE LIZ CHENEY THIS MORNING SPOKE ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THE COMMITTEE'S UPCOMING FINAL REPORT.  WE HAVE GOT INTERVIEWS THAT ARE STILL UNDERWAY. WE HAVE WORK THAT IS GOING ON ON THE FINAL REPORT. AND, THE REPORT ITSELF, WE REALLY RECOGNIZE AND TAKE SERIOUSLY THAT IT IS A HISTORIC DOCUMENT, HISTORIC RECORD OF THE COMMITTEE'S WORK. THE REPORT WILL HAVE IN IT CHAPTERS THAT ADDRESS THE TOPICS THAT WE ADDRESSED IN OUR HEARINGS. THEY WILL HAVE CHAPTERS THAT ADDRESS ADDITIONAL MATERIAL AND ADDITIONAL TOPICS. THERE HAS BEEN SOME ASSERTION THAT THE COMMITTEE IS NOT GOING TO PRODUCE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SECURITY FAILURES, THAT IS JUST SIMPLY NOT TRUE. IT WILL BE A COMPREHENSIVE REPORT.  THIS COMMENT FOLLOW THE DEFIANCE YESTERDAY BY THE EX-PRESIDENT OF HIS SUBPOENA, THE ONE ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE LAST MONTH FOR HIS TESTIMONY AND DOCUMENTS. IN A STATEMENT CHENEY AND BENNIE THOMPSON SAID THIS, QUOTE, EVEN THOUGH THE FORMER PRESIDENT INITIALLY SUGGESTED THAT HE WOULD TESTIFY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE, HE HAS SINCE FILED A LAWSUIT ASKING COURTS TO PROTECT HIM FROM GIVING TESTIMONY. THE TRUTH IS THAT DONALD TRUMP, LIKE SEVERAL OF HIS CLOSEST ALLIES, IS HIDING FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEE'S INVESTIGATION AND REFUSING TO DO WHAT MORE THAN A THOUSAND OTHER WITNESSES HAVE DONE. THIS IS A STATEMENT REFERENCES TRUMP HAS SUED COMMITTEE, THAT WAS LAST WEEK, OVER THE SUBPOENA OF HIM. IT IS A STONEWALLING TACTIC THAT MIGHT WORK AS THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTED. QUOTE, THE SUIT MAKES IT HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT TRUMP WILL TESTIFY GIVEN THAT THE COMMITTEE IS SET TO DISSOLVE IN JANUARY WITH REPUBLICANS ON A PATH TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, IT IS ALL BUT CERTAIN THEY WILL NOT CONTINUE THE INQUIRY, JOINING US NOW IS DENVER WRIGGLEMAN, AUTHOR OF THE BREACH INTO THE INVESTIGATION INTO JANUARY 6. AND LUKE BROADWATER, LUKE, LET ME START WITH YOU. AND IT WAS INTERESTING AND I THINK WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU THAT THE FINAL REPORT WOULD BE CHAPTER AND VERSE ON DONALD TRUMP'S ROLE IS MAKING IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE THRUST WILL ALSO INCLUDE A LOT OF RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE SECURITY FAILINGS. WHAT TO MAKE OF THE CONGRESSWOMAN'S COMMENTS SHAPING IN THE FINAL MONTHS OF EXIST, THE COMMITTEE'S WORK PRODUCT.  RIGHT. WELL YOU KNOW, THEY DID HAVE SEPARATE TEAMS INVESTIGATING ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL. AND THEY DID HAVE A TEAM DEDICATED TO INVESTIGATING SECURITY FAILURES. BUT THAT HAS DONE A LOT OF INTERVIEWS AND A LOT OF IN DEPTH WORK AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT YET AT THE PUBLIC HEARINGS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THAT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL REPORT. BUT AS LIZ CHENEY HAS INDICATED, THEY DO WANT TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON DONALD TRUMP AND THEY BELIEVE IT IS SOMEWHAT OF A MISDIRECTION TO IN THEIR VIEW PUT THE BLAME ON LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THE -- IN THEIR VIEW THE HEROS WHO WERE PROTECTING THE CAPITOL THAT DAY RATHER THAN THE PERSON WHO SENT THE MOB TO THE CAPITOL AND CAUSED ALL OF THE VIOLENCE. THEY DO THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO INVESTIGATE THOSE THINGS AND TO PRODUCE REVELATIONS ABOUT THEM. BUT IT IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS GETTING TO THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE VIOLENCE AND THEY THINK THAT IS ENTIRELY THE FAULT OF ONE MAN AND THAT MAN IS DONALD TRUMP.  YEAH, I MEAN, DEBORAH, YOU COULD ALMOST HEAR THE ECHOES OF LIZ CHENEY'S FRAMING OF 9/11, THAT AIRPORT SECURITY IS IMPORTANT BUT 9/11 WAS BECAUSE OF ONE MAN, BIN LADEN. JUST TALK ABOUT WHAT IS STILL TO BE REVEALED BY COMMITTEE IN ITS FINAL PRODUCT WHICH IS THIS REPORT.  YOU KNOW, IF I GO BACK TO WHEN I WAS THERE, I'M WONDERING ABOUT THE APPENDIX THAT THEY WILL ADD BASED ON THE OTHER SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION OR EVIDENCE FOR WHAT THEY COVERED IN EACH HEARING. AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SECURITY THAT DAY. FOR ME, AND I DEPLOYED FOR 9/11, NOBODY BLAMING LAW ENFORCEMENT. I THINK WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS THE LEADERSHIP AND BUREAUCRATIC BREAK DOWNS, HOW DID THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE BREAK DOWN OF SECURITY. SO FOR ME IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR SOMEONE WHO IS A MILITARY VETERAN AND IN COMMUNICATIONS BUT I THINK WHAT THEY DID AS FAR AS IDENTIFYING TRUMP AS A PERSON WHO IS REALLY FRAMING WITH THIS THE COMMANDER'S INTENT ON EVERYBODY AROUND HIM ON KPLAND AND CONTROL AND I THINK THEY DID A FANTASTIC JOB DOING THAT. WHAT I WONDER ABOUT IS IN THE APPENDIX, ARE YOU GOING TO SEE SOME OF THAT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION EVIDENCE AND DATA, ON OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE PART OF THAT. THOSE PEOPLE THAT WERE WORKING WITH THE PROUD BOYS AN OATH KEEPERS AND RALLY-GOERS. I'M INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT -- HOW THAT IS COVERED IN THE REPORT AS THEY GO FORWARD.  AND, LUKE, LIZ SAID IN THAT INTERVIEW, THERE ARE INTERVIEWS THAT ARE ONGOING. ONE OF THE CAN OF WORMS THAT WAS OPENED AND STILL SORT OF SPILLING OUT AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE FINAL PUBLIC HEARING WAS THEIR INQUIRY INTO SECRET SERVICE. DO YOU KNOW WHERE THAT STANDS OR IS THAT SOME OF THE NEW CONTENT THAT MAY BE IN THE FINAL REPORT?  YES. ABSOLUTELY. THAT IS THE HOTTEST BIT OF INVESTIGATION THAT IS GOING ON RIGHT NOW. THEY HAVE BEEN BRINGING IN SEVERAL PEOPLE FROM THAT AGENCY, MORE PEOPLE EVERY WEEK. AND THEY HAVE JUST SO MANY RECORDS THAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS REPORT. AND I DO UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME NEW FINDINGS. WE SAW A FEW OF THEM AT THE LAST HEARING. BUT THEY HAVE EVEN MORE FROM RECENT INTERVIEWS INCLUDING SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN THE MOTORCADE AND WHO TESTIFY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S BEHAVIOR, WHAT HE WANTED TO GO TO THE CAPITOL AND JOIN THE MOB AS THEY WERE LAYING SIEGE TO THE CAPITOL. SO, I DO THINK WE'LL SEE MORE OF THAT AND THAT IS THE MOST ACTIVE PART OF THE INVESTIGATION RIGHT NOW.  SO A TWO PART QUESTION FOR YOU, JOHN CARL SAID IN LAST HOUR, THAT I ASKED OF LIZ CHENEY IS TALKING LIKE SOMEBODY WHO HAS WRITTEN A CRIMINAL REFERRAL FOR DONALD TRUMP. HE SAID THAT WAS VERY MUCH A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY AT THIS POINT. I WOULD LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. AND THE SECOND PART IS THAT CLARENCE THOMAS ONCE AGAIN VOTED TO RESTRICT ACCESS BY THE JANUARY 6 COMMITTEE BY RECORDS, THIS ONE IS BY KELLI WARD, THE SUPREME COURT VOTED, HE WAS IN THE MINORITY WITH ALITO BUT THEY'VE ALLOWED ACCESS TO PHONE RECORDS. WHY DOES HE KEEP ACTING LIKE SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T WANT EVERYONE TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 6.  METADATA IS VERY POWERFUL. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT KELLI WARD, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO COULD BE IN THE POLITICAL SIDE AND THE LEGAL AND THE MILITANT SIDE. SO WHEN YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS FIGHTING THEIR PHONE RECORDS, YOU WONDER WHY. AND THERE COULD BE ONE OR TWO CALLS THAT GO TO PEOPLE THAT ARE RALLY OR RIGHT EXTREMIST GROUPS AND THERE ARE WHITE HOUSE NUMBERS AND WHO WAS SHE TALKING TO IN THE WHITE HOUSE AROUND JANUARY 6. AS FAR AS THE SECRET SERVICE TEXT, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT IS POLICING. BUT THE BEFORE AND AFTER COULD BE VERY POWERFUL. ON THE SECRET SERVICE TEXT, IF THEY COULD PUT THAT THREAD TOGETHER IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO SEE WHO THOUGHT TRUMP WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING AND WOULD WAS SUPPORTING HIM AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AS FAR AS KELLY WORD, I THINK YOU HAVE A FACTOR FOR PEOPLE'S WHOSE DATA OUT THERE WHETHER THEY REALIZE THAT THE TECHNICAL TEAMS HAVE A MILLIONS OF LINE OF DATA AND THERE IS A LINK SYSTEM TO SEE THE CONNECTIONS VERY QUICKLY. AND IT IS VERY, VERY ROBUST. SO I THINK YOU SEE THAT IS WHY PEOPLE ARE FIGHTING. NOW AS FAR AS JENNY THOMAS AND CLARENCE THOMAS, IT IS A SURPRISE THAT HE VOTED AGAINST THIS. I HAVE A SPECIAL PLACE IN MY HEART WITH THE THOMAS' AND IT IS TO A POINT THAT THERE IS NOT MORE INVESTIGATION INTO JENNY THOMAS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. I THINK SHE'S KEY. I WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO SEE THE TEXT MESSAGES, I THINK WE NEED TO DO A MUCH DEEPER DRIVE INTO GINNI THOMAS AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE AROUND HER.  TWO OF THE BEST OF THE BEST. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SPENDING TIME WITH US TODAY. > WHEN WE COME BACK, THE FUTURE OF ABORTION RIGHTS AND ABORTION ACCESS IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AFTER VOTERS MADE IT A TOP PRIORITY FOR THEM IN THE MIDTERMS LAST WEEK. WE'LL BE BACK WITH THAT CONVERSATION AFTER A QUICK BREAK. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. FTER A QUICK BREAK. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. 20221115222733.814|20221115223056.116",

        "trs": "> THERE WAS OUTRAGE ACROSS THE STATE FROM SO MANY WOMEN, NOT JUST DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, NONPARTISANS, WOMEN AND MEN, EVERYBODY THAT I TALKED TO, JUST OUTRAGE AND WANT TO PROTECT THE RIGHT OF WOMEN IN THIS STATE REALLY TO MAKE THAT DECISION THEMSELVES AND LEAVE THAT AS A DECISION FOR WOMEN, THEIR DOCTORS OR WHOEVER THEY DECIDE.  THE REASON WHY THEY CAME OUT IN DROVES IS BECAUSE THEY WANT THEIR RIGHTS, THEY'RE RIGHTS TO ABORTION.  I REMEMBER AN OLDER WOMAN IN LAWRENCE COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA. A PRETTY REPUBLICAN COMMUNITY, LITERALLY JOE, LIKE GRABBED ME BY THE JACKET AND PULLED ME NO NOAA HER FACE WITH A FINGER IN MY FACE, DO NOT LET US GO BACK TO WHAT IT WAS LIKE BEFORE ROE.  WOW, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES WHAT THEY HEARD ON THE TRAIL AND HOW THAT BACKLASH TO THE REPUBLICAN'S OBSESSION WITH STRIPPING WOMEN OF THE RIGHTS AND THE ABILITY TO CONTROL THEIR OWN BODIES AND MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES. HELPED PROPEL DEMOCRATS OVER THE FINISH LINE IN LAST WEEK'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS. WITH THE PATH NARROWING FOR DEMOCRATS TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, THE FIGHT OVER ABORTION ACCESS IN AMERICA CONTINUES AT THE STATE LEVEL. IN GEORGIA A JUDGE STRUCK DOWN THE SIX-WEEK ABORTION BAN SAYING THAT IT VIOLATED THE U.S. CONSTITUTION AND U.S. SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT WHETHER IT WAS ENACTED. IN KENTUCKY THE SUPREME COURT WILL HEAR ARGUMENTS OVER THE SWEEPING ABORTION BAN. JOINING US NOW, THREE PEOPLE ON THIS TOPIC, SES I'LL RICHARDS AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND MICHELLE GOODWIN, FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE AND DR. KAVITA PATEL IS BACK. WHETHER WE SPOKE ON EITHER MONDAY OR TUESDAY AHEAD OF THE ELECTION, I THINK EVEN WE MAY HAVE UNDERESTIMATED OR AT LEAST IN WHAT WE WERE WILLING TO SAY PUBLICLY HOW BIG OF A VOTING DRIVER THAT WOULD BE. YOUR THOUGHTS A WEEK LATER?  NO, YOU'RE RIGHT, NICOLLE. I THINK EVERYONE WAS ANXIOUS. BUT IT IS INCREDIBLE ACTUALLY, THIS IS A CONSISTENT STORY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT WASN'T JUST AN ISOLATED ELECTION OR ONE STATE. AND YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THE ENTIRE TRAJECTORY AFTER THE DOBBS DECISION, WE SAW KANSAS, THE OVERWHELMING VOTE TO REJECT THE EFFORTS TO TRY TO BAN ABORTION IN THAT STATE. WE SAW THAT SPECIAL ELECTIONS AND THEN ON ELECTION DAY WE SAW A HUGE SPIKE IN THE GENDER GAP, VOTE OF YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE OUTRAGED AT THE THOUGHT THEY NO LONGER HAVE RIGHTS TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR BODIES. MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, EVERYWHERE WE LOOKED. AND I THINK ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING THINGS IS IT WAS VERY CONSISTENT. IT IS VERY CLEAR TO SEE. WE SAW ABORTION RANKING AS THE TOP VOTING ISSUE FOR DEMOCRATS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND YET SOMEHOW STILL THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS SEEMING TO BE IN TOTAL DENIAL ABOUT HOW MUCH THE DOBBS DECISION AND THEIR EFFORTS TO TAKE AWAY SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION IN THIS COUNTRY DROVE VOTERS TO THE POLLS THIS ELECTION.  AND MICHELLE, THEY'RE IN DENIAL THAT THIS IS THE NEW NORMAL. THIS NOTION THAT VOTER ANGER OVER THE DOBBS DECISION PEAKED TOO EARLY WAS BOTH TRAGIC AND HILARIOUS TO ME. LIKE WE GOT OVER IT. WOMEN WERE STILL ACTIVELY DELETING PERIOD TRACKERS BUT OUR RAGE HAS ABATED BY ELECTION DAY. THIS NEW STRUCTURE AROUND VOTE -- IS WHAT VOTING HABITS LOOK LIKE TO GET TO THIS POINT WITH THE SUPREME COURT. AND THE FIRST PIECE OF EXIT POLL STATA WAS THAT 60% OF VOTERS DISAPPROVED OF THE DOBBS DECISION AND 60% ZIS APPROVED THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. WHAT DO WE DO WITH THAT BROAD OF A COALITION THAT DOES NOT APPROVE DIRECTION FOR THE COUNTRY.  I'M NOT SURPRISED BY THE OUTCOME AND LEADING UP THIS IS WHAT I WAS SAYING. THEY DIDN'T ACCOUNT FOR IS THAT MOTHERS WOULD BE LOOKING ACROSS THE TABLE AT THEIR DAUGHTERS. THAT IS NOT JUST DEMOCRATIC MOMS, THAT IS REPUBLICAN MOMS. REMEMBER AFTER THAT 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL HAD TO FLEE OHIO, GOING TO STATE OF INDIANA, THERE WERE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS THAT SAID IT IS A HOAX. AND THEN DISTURBINGLY FOLLOWING THAT WAS THAT, WELL IF IT IS NOT A HOAX, THEN A 10 OR 11 OR 12-YEAR-OLD SHOULD BECOME A MOTHER. AND ANY WOMAN, NOT JUST DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, ET CETERA, HAS TO LOOK ACROSS THE TABLE AT HER DAUGHTER AND THINK IF SOMETHING HAPPENS TO ME CHILD, AM I GOING ALLOW A STRANGER WHO DOESN'T EVEN KNOW US, DOESN'T KNOW OUR VALUES, TO DICTATE THAT MY 11-YEAR-OLD IS SUPPOSED TO BECOME A MOTHER. ESPECIALLY IN A COUNTRY WITH SUCH HIGH MATERNAL MORTALITY RATES. THERE IS A FAILURE TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS IS AN ECONOMICS ISSUE. SO THAT AS REPUBLICANS WERE SAYING, WHAT PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT, IS THEIR GAS PRICES AND SO FORTH. THEY DON'T REALIZE THAT CHILDCARE IS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE. WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE IS AN ECONOMIC ISSUE. ABORTION IS ALSO AN ECONOMIC ISSUE. GAS PRICES WILL GO UP AN DOWN, THE COST OF OUR BROCCOLI UP OR DOWN. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT CHILDCARE COSTS, THE COST OF RAISING A CHILD, THE COST OF EDUCATING A CHILD, THE COST OF COLLEGE, THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY GOING UP AND ARE STAYING UP. IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT GOES UP AND DOWN WITH THE MARKET PLACE. AND SO, THIS IS TIME TO BE PREPARED FOR WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN 2024.  DR. PATEL, THE PROBLEM WITH JUST FOCUSING ON THE POLITICS, THOUGH, FOR ME HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT THERE IS SOMEONE TODAY WHO WANTS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THAT SHE PROBABLY CAN'T GET. WHAT DO WE DO FOR THEM?  YEAH, THAT IS -- I MEAN, NICOLLE, I WAS JUST THINKING, YOU DON'T REMEMBER WHEN I WAS IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAT WE COULD NEVER GET COMPLACENT, BECAUSE WHEN WE HAVE HAVE A VICTORY, WE HAVE TEN GROUPS THAT SOO DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT VICTORY AND WE HAVE THAT IN MORE THAN A DOZEN STATES WHERE PATIENTS AND THEIR CARE TEAMS AND EVERYBODY IS HELD IN PARALYSIS BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET THE BENEFIT OF BEING IN MICHIGAN OR CALIFORNIA OR VERMONT OR BENEFITING FROM THE VOTERS IN KANSAS OR KENTUCKY. SO THEY'RE ALL SITTING TODAY LITERALLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY CAN DO SO THEY DON'T END UP THERE JAIL, AND WHAT IS WORSE, WHAT COMES BACK DOWN TO THE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES, AND THEY'RE NOT EVEN SEEING A LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. I SAW A LIGHT LAST TUESDAY AND THEN IT KIND OF -- I GOT CREPT OVER BY A LITTLE BIT OF THE DARKNESS. LIKE NOW WHAT. SO THIS IS GREAT. WE AVOIDED WHAT I WOULD SAY IS DEMOCRATIC DISASTER. BUT NOW WHAT? WHAT DO WE HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO. SO WE HAVE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO KEEP PUSHING ON BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS, STATES AROUND, LIKE CALIFORNIA, IS GETTING SO MUCH INFLUX THEY DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. WE NEED TO BE AS CREATIVE AS POSSIBLE AND ALLOW FOR A WORK FORCE THAT COULD HELP PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE THAT ARE IN THESE PLACES THAT CAN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE JUSTICE AND GIVE MORE POWER TO THE NURSES AND THE DOCTORS AND THEIR TEAMS WHO ARE TRYING TO STAND UP, NICOLLE, IN SOME CASES UP TO HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS THAT DON'T WANT TO TURN SIDEWAYS FROM POLITICAL PRESSURE. THEY HAVE TO KEEP THEIR STATE LEGISLATORS HAPPY SO THEY COULD KEEP GETTING FUNDING AND I GET THAT. BUT THEY'RE TELLING THEIR TEAMS STAND DOWN, WE DON'T WANT TO OFFER THESE SERVICES EVEN IN SAFE STATES. SO WE NEED TO KEEP IT TRANSPARENT AND WHEN WE HAVE ONE VICTORY, REMEMBER THERE ARE SO MANY MORE THAT NEED THAT FIGHT.  SO WHAT DOES THE CONVERSATION LOOK LIKE WITH, IF WE START IT HERE AND KEEP IT GOING. WHAT DOES THAT CONVERSATION SOUND LIKE?  WELL, I THINK OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO IMPRESS UPON ALL OF THESE STATES, WE NOW HAVE A THIRD OF THE COUNTRY WHERE WOMEN NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAFE AND LEGAL ABORTION. AND IT LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST FOR A WHILE NOW IT IS GOING TO BE A STATE BY STATE ISSUE. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FIGHT A 50 STATE FIGHT. IT IS NOT THE STORIES THAT WE'RE HEARING, THE 10-YEAR-OLD IN OHIO, THE COUPLE THAT HAS A VERY COMPLEX MEDICALLY CHALLENGED PREGNANCY, TO ME WHAT I WORRY ABOUT IS WHAT THE MINISTER TOLD ME IN DALLAS THE OTHER DAY, I WORRY ABOUT THE THOUSANDS OF WOMEN THAT WE DON'T HEAR THEIR STORIES BECAUSE THE FEAR THAT IS TAKING PLACE ACROSS THE COUNTRY NOW IS SO PROFOUND. ONE OTHER THING THAT I THINK FROM MICHELLE'S POINT IS REALLY RIGHT AND IT -- WHAT -- WHEN WE'RE SEEING AN OLDER WOMAN GRABBING HIM BY THE LAPELS, THE STORIES WERE FOR GETTING AND POLITICIANS MIGHT NOT BE AWARE OF, PEOPLE I'M HEARING FROM TOO, WHOSE CHILDREN ARE NOW TRYING TO GET PREGNANT, HAVING-AND I REMEMBER THERE WOMAN IN DALLAS SAID TO PLEA, SHE SAID, LOOK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY POLITICS IS INVOLVED. I JUST WANT A HEALTHY GRANDCHILD. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT TRANSCENDS PARTY AND INCOME, GEOGRAPHY AND THIS IS AN AMERICAN CRY FOR JUSTICE AND FREEDOM TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT OUR BODIES, ABOUT OUR PREGNANCIES AND ABOUT OUR FAMILIES. AND I JUST HOPE TO GOD SOMEBODY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS PAYING ATTENTION AND LISTENING. BECAUSE AS MICHELLE SAID, THIS MIDTERM ELECTION WAS ONE MOMENT, BUT THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE ON INTO THIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AS WELL.  MICHELLE, I THOUGHT THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN DR. OZ SAID IN THAT DEBATE AN I THINK EVERYONE POLICED WHAT THE NATIONAL RESPONSE WAS, EVERYONE WAS OBSESSED, AS THOUGH NO ONE HAS SEEN ANYONE RECOVERING FROM A STOKE. BUT OZ SAID IN THE ROOM WHEN ABORTION DECISIONS ARE MADE, SHOULD BE THE WOMAN, THE DOCTOR, AND LOCAL POLITICIANS. AND THERE IT IS. THERE IS ALWAYS ONE COMMENT THAT SLICES THROUGH LIKE A HOT KNIFE IN FROZEN BUTTER AND THERE, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IS YOUR GOP.  THAT IS RIGHT. IT WAS A SLIP OF THE TONGUE. A FREUDIAN SLIP ORS WHAT IT. FOR MORE THAN HALF OF THE GIRLS AN PEOPLE FOR THE CAPACITY FOR PREGNANCY IN THIS COUNTRY, THEY ARE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES, ABOUT THEIR LIVES. AND THIS IS A TRAGEDY THAT IS SOMETHING THAT PREDATES EVEN ROE V. WADE. SOMETHING THAT IS NOT TALKED ABOUT IS A CASE FROM 1942, A CASE CALLED SKINNER V. OKLAHOMA AND IN THE CASE IT WAS 9-0 AND THE SUPREME COURT SAID IT WAS A HUMAN RIGHT, A CIVIL RIGHT, THEIR WORDS, TO DETERMINE ONE'S OWN REPRODUCTIVE FUTURE AND SOMETHING THAT A STATE COULD NOT INTERFERE WITH. NOW GRANTED THAT CASE INVOLVED A MAN, IT DOESN'T INVOLVE A WOMAN. BUT IT IS OFTEN NOT MENTIONED EVEN BY THE SUPREME COURT IN THE MIX OF AN ABORTION CONVERSATION, BECAUSE ABORTION INVOLVES GIRLS AND WOMEN AND NOW PEOPLE WITH THE CAPACITY FOR PREGNANCY. NOW, WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO STATE ELECTIONS NOT ONLY WITH LAWMAKERS BUT STATE JUDGES AS WELL. BECAUSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN POURED IN FROM ANTI-ABORTION PACS TO SHAPE THE ELECTION AT STATE COURT LEVELS. AND THAT IS WHERE SOME OF THESE FIGHTS WILL GO TO NEXT. SO IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUST PULL THE LEVER WHEN IT COMES TO ABORTION ON THE BALLOT. ONE ACTUALLY HAS TO PAY ATTENTION TO WHO THE JUDGES ARE THAT ARE BEING ELECTED. WHO ARE RUNNING ON ANTI-ABORTION PLATFORMS WHICH IS STUNNING AND SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN SEEN BEFORE.  THE THREE OF YOU ADDED SO MUCH TO OUR ABILITY TO COVER THIS STORY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. SO TO ALL THREE OF YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND TO BE CONTINUED. THANK YOU SO MUCH. > WHEN WE COME BACK, ONE OF BIGGEST WINNERS FROM LAST WEEK'S MIDTERM ELECTIONS VIEWED NOW AS A NATIONAL RISING STAR ON THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, HE RAN ON PROTECTING THE RIGHT TO PLAQUE DECISIONS ABOUT YOUR OWN BODY AND PROTECTING DEMOCRACY AND HE WON BY A HUGE MARGIN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR ELECT JOSH SHAPIRO IS OUR NEXT GUEST. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. 20221115224437.469|20221115224713.993",

        "trs": "> YOU KNOW, THIS GUY LOVES TO TALK A GOOD GAME ABOUT FREEDOM. RIGHT. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IT IS NOT FREEDOM TO TELL WOMEN WHAT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO DO WITH THEIR BODIES. THAT IS NOT FREEDOM. AND IT SURE AS HELL ISN'T FREEDOM TO SAY YOU COULD GO VOTE, BUT HE GETS TO PICK THE WINNER. THAT IS NOT FREEDOM.  IT WAS ONE OF THE DEFINING POLITICAL SPEECHES OF THE THESE MIDTERMS. LIKELY PART OF THE REASON JOSH SHAPIRO WON, NOT ONLY DOES HE WIN, BEATING BIG LIE SUPPORTER EXTREME CANDIDATE DOUG MASTRIANO BY 14 POINTS, HE BROKE THE RECORD FOR MOST VOTES FOR A GOVERNOR IN PENNSYLVANIA HISTORY. JOINING US NOW IS PENNSYLVANIA GOVERNOR ELECT JOSH SHAPIRO. CONGRATULATIONS ON THE WIN.  THANK YOU.  CAN WE GO BACK A MINUTE THOUGH, TO THAT CLOSING MESSAGE. I SAW THAT SPEECH AND I SAW PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH. YOU BROUGHT THE HOUSE DOWN BUT YOU ALSO DID THIS EXTRAORDINARY THING IN A MIDTERM ELECTION, YOU RAN ON FREEDOM.  YEAH. LOOK, I THINK YOU'VE HAD THE OTHER SIDE. BUT MY OPPONENT AND OTHERS LIKE HIM ACROSS THE COUNTRY TALK IN A GOOD GAME ABOUT FREEDOM THE AND THEY LOVE TO LIKE CLOAK THEMSELVES IN THE BLANKET OF FREEDOM AND WEAR THE AMERICAN FLAG AND WHAT THEY WERE SELLING WASN'T FREEDOM. THEY WERE TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S RIGHTS, RESTRICTING FREEDOMS. AND I'LL BE HONEST, I JUST GOT SICK AND TIRED OF IT. SO, ONE DAY IN ERIE, WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK TO A GROUP, I SAID I'M GOING TO TRY TO REDEFINE THE WAY FREEDOM IS PERCEIVED IN OUR POLITICS AND ALSO EXPLAINING WHAT FREEDOM LOOKS LIKE. GIVING PEOPLE A OPPORTUNITY FOR A QUALITY EDUCATION, A SAFE COMMUNITY TO LIVE IN. AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A JOB AND THEIR COMMUNITY THAT IS GOING TO HELP SUSTAIN THEIR FAMILIES AND THEN PROTECTING THEIR RIGHT, WHETHER IT IS THE RIGHT TO VOTE OR MAKE DECISIONS OVER THEIR OWN BODY. SO THAT IS TRYING TO RECLAIM FREE ZOM AND HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS REALLY AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION.  LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW IF WHAT HAPPENS IN PENNSYLVANIA COULD HAPPEN EVERYWHERE. BUT I KNOW FROM BEING A REPUBLICAN THAT IF YOU TAKE FROM THEM THIS IDEA THAT REPUBLICANS REALLY DON'T STAND FOR FREEDOM AT ALL, THEY ARE LEFT WITH NOTHING. WE KNOW IT IS A LIE AND YOU KNOW IT IS A LIE BUT VOTERS THINK THAT LIVE FREE OR DIE, THAT IS THE REPUBLICAN BRAND. WHAT ARE YOUR -- ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC THAT YOU COULD TAKE THIS CONCEPT, THIS FRAME, BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY HOLDS. THE RIGHT TO HAVE A GUN MEANS OUR KIDS CAN'T GO TO SCHOOL SAFELY AND WOMEN CAN'T MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR OWN BODY AND DO ALL THEIR GARBAGE ON GAP WITH EXTREMIST GROUPS MEANS WE COULDN'T PARTICIPATE IN OUR ELECTIONS SAFELY. IT DOES APPLY TO EVERYTHING HAPPENING ON THE RIGHT AND HOW WOULD YOU ADVISE PEOPLE TO TAKE .  YEAH, YOU ASKED ME IF I'M OPTIMISTIC. I SURE AM. I'M OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE THE GOOD PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA HAD TWO DISTINCTIVE CHOICES ON THIS NOTION OF FREEDOM, IF YOU WILL, AND BY A RESOUNDING MARGIN -- YOU MENTIONED THIS BEFORE -- I RECEIVED MORE VOTES THAN ANY GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE IN THE HISTORY OF PENNSYLVANIA. THEY CHOSE REAL FREEDOM IN THIS CAMPAIGN. AND THEY CAME TOGETHER, REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT, AND INDEPENDENT, AND ENDORSED THIS APPROACH. AND THEY WANT ME TO BE SOMEONE WHO'S GOING TO PROTECT THEIR FREEDOM AND CREATE REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM, FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND FOR THEMSELVES. AND THAT TO ME IS WHAT WAS ON THE BALLOT, AND WE RECEIVED A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF VOTES, A RECORD NUMBER OF VOTES AND NOW WE HAVE A MANDATE TO LEAD WITH REAL FREEDOM GOING FORWARD.  YOUR OPPONENT WAS ONE OF THE UGLIER AVATARS FOR TRUMPISM. HE RAN AN OPENLY EXTREMIST AND ANTI-SEMITIC CAMPAIGN. BUT I THINK WHAT TRUMPISM AND WHAT TRUMP TAUGHT US IS IT'S OUT THERE, AND WHAT PEOPLE LIKE TRUMP AND MASTRIANO DO IS GIVE IT A PERMISSION STRUCTURE. WHAT IN YOUR VIEW THE BEST WAY TO DERADICALIZE THOSE PEOPLE SO THE DOUG MASTRIANOS AND TRUMPS DON'T SWAY ANYONE?  CONFRONT IT, AND CONFRONT IT HEAD ON, AS WE DID WITH FREEDOM. CALL OUT THEIR BS. SORRY IF I'M NOT ALLOWED TO SAY THAT. AND MAKE SURE YOU LET PEOPLE KNOW WHAT'S REALLY AT STAKE. I THINK MANY POLITICIANS, PARTICULARLY SOME IN MY PARTY TEND TO BACK DOWN IN THE FACE OF A CONVERSATION ABOUT FREEDOM AND IN THE FACE OF A CONVERSATION ABOUT DEMOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY. LOOK, THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BIND US ALL TOGETHER ARE THAT WE CHERISH OUR FREEDOM. WE'LL DEPEND OUR DEMOCRACY, AND WE LOVE THIS COUNTRY. AND WE HAVE TO CLAIM THAT. WE HAVE TO STAND UP AND SPEAK OUT ON THAT, AND WE HAVE TO CONFRONT THE EXTREMISM AND DANGER WHEREVER WE FIND IT. I HAVE LONG BELIEVED THAT ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT STEPS WE NEED TO TAKE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE EXTREMISM AND DERADICALIZE OUR POLITICS, IS TO DEFEAT THOSE WHO ARE PERPETUAING IT. BECAUSE REALLY, THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS THE REASON THEY ACT THE WAY THEY DO, THESE EXTREMISTS IS BECAUSE THEY'RE PROFOUNDLY WEAK PEOPLE. THEY'RE UNMOORED, UNCONNECTED TO THE THREE VIRTUES. IF YOU DEFEAT THEM, YOU SHOW THEM THERE'S NO PATHWAY AND OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCESS POLITICALLY FOR THEM, THEN YOU CAN BEGIN TO HAVE A DIALOGUE AND GET BACK TO GOVERNING WITH SOME SENSIBILITY, GET BACK TO ELIMINATING THE EXTREMES FROM OUR POLITICS. BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE DEFEATING THEM IS THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS. WE HAVE TO KEEP WORKING ON THE PERFECTING OUR UNION, KEEP WORKING AT MAKING SURE THAT THIS EXTREMISM IS ERADICATES FROM OUR POLITICS. SO TO ME, DEFEATING THIS DANGEROUS EXTREMIST WAS JOB ONE, AND NOW I HAVE TO GOVERN IN A WAY THAT CONTINUES TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND BRINGS OUR POLITICS BACK TO SOME NORMALITY.  YOUR CANDIDACY, AND WE COVERED IT A LOT HERE, YOUR CAMPAIGN MESSAGE, GOVERNOR WHITMER'S CANDIDACY AND MESSAGE, MARRYING ABORTION AND THE ECONOMY -- SOMETHING YOU DID AS WELL -- WES MOORE'S CANDIDACY IN MARYLAND -- I MEAN, THERE ARE A LOT OF BRIGHT LIGHTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. HOW LONG THE IDEA OF A RED WAVE SEEPED INTO THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM TO BEGIN WITH?  I DON'T KNOW. I HEARD THAT A LOT AS I WAS OUT CAMPAIGNING. I NEVER FELT THAT. BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS HONESTLY JUST KIND OF LIKE FOCUSED LIKE A LASER BEAM ON MY OWN RACE AND NOT PAYING A WHOLE LOT OF ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN OTHER STATES. WHAT I FOUND WHEN I TRAVELED -- WHETHER I WAS IN A RURAL OR URBAN COMMUNITIES, FOLKS BASICALLY WANTED THE SAME THING. THEY WANTED SOMEONE WHO WAS GOING TO DEFEND THEIR FREEDOM, WHO WOULD DELIVER WHEN IT CAME TO NATIONAL SECURITYING IN THEIR SCHOOLS AND SAFER COMMUNITCOMMU GROWING THE ECONOMY. THEY WANTED SOMEONE WITH A POWERFUL RECORD OF TAKING ON THE SPECIAL INTERESTS. IT WAS UNIVERSAL, NO MATTER WHAT THE TERRAIN WAS. AND OF COURSE THAT IS WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DELIVER, NOT JUST THROUGH THINK TRACK RECORD AS A.G. BUT THROUGHOUT MY CAMPAIGN AND WHAT I'LL DO AS GOVERNOR. I NEVER FELT A BIG RED WAVE COMING. I FELT PENNSYLVANIANS AROUND THE NOTION OF GOOD SCHOOLS, COMMUNITIES, AND AN ECONOMY THAT LIFTS ALL UP, AND REAL FREEDOM.  WHEN WE GOT NEWS YOU WERE GOING TO GIVE YOUR SPEECH AFTER THE RACE WAS CALLED, I SAID TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE DESK, IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO HEAR IF DOUG MASTRIANO CALLED HIM. I SUSPECTED HE HADN'T, AND HE HADN'T, BUT HE DID CONCEDE. IT TOOK NAIVE DAYS. DO YOU THINK THE AUTHORITARIAN IMPULSES OF THE EX PRESIDENT THAT SEEM TO HAVE TRANSFERRED TO PEOPLE LIKE DOUG MASTRIANO, DO YOU THINK THAT'S -- OR DO YOU THINK THAT'S OUT THERE AND THEY HAD A BAD NIGHT?  I THINK IT'S STILL OUT THERE. AND TIME WILL TELL IF THAT GRIP THAT HE'S HAD ON PEOPLE LIKE MY FORMER OPPONENT OR NOT IS, YOU KNOW, RELAXING A BIT. BUT WHAT'S CLEAR IS THAT IT'S ALWAYS NONSENSE THEY WERE SPEWING. THESE CONSPIRACY THEORIES. IT WAS NEVER REAL. BUT THEY WERE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD GET SOME SHORT-TERM POLITICAL GAIN OUT OF IT. THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD GET LOVE FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT THEY THOUGHT WAS VALUABLE, AND NOTHING CAN DENY THE FACT THAT WE HAD A FREE AND FAIR AND SAFE ELECTION IN 2020 AND AGAIN IN 2022. AND THEN MY OPPONENT GOT WHOOPED IN THE PROCESS. AND WHAT WE NOW REALLY NEED TO DO IS FOCUS ON CONTINUING TO ERADICATE THIS EXTREMISM IN OUR POLITICS AND DOING THE HARD WORK. THIS IS THE HARD WORK. THE HARD WORK IN GOVERNING OF BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. I'VE DONE THAT THROUGHOUT MY CAREER. I'VE GOT A MANDATE TO DO THAT NOW AS PENNSYLVANIA'S NEXT GOVERNOR AND THAT, IF WE DO THAT EFFECTIVELY THAT WILL CONTINUE TO ERODE THAT GRIP THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT STILL HAS ON SOME POLITICIANS IN THE NATION.  AND AS HE POTENTIALLY -- I DON'T KNOW IF HE LEFT, BUT RE-ENTERS POLITICS TONIGHT, WE'LL SEE HOW REPUBLICANS DEAL WITH THAT. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR BIG WIN. JOSH SHAPIRO, THANK YOU FOR SPENDING TIME WITH US TODAY.  QUICK BREAK FOR US. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. OR US. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. 20221115225706.786|20221115225930.629",

        "trs": "> WE'VE GOT BREAKING NEWS JUST IN FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS THAT THE GEORGIA ABORTION BAN THAT ESSENTIALLY BANS ABORTION STARTING AT SIX WEEKS OF PREGNANCY HAS BEEN OVERTURNED, RULING TUESDAY, A JUDGE, THAT IT VIOLATES THE U.S. CONSTITUTION AND U.S. SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT WHEN IT WAS ENACTED. IT PROHIBITED MOST ABORTIONS WHEN A HEARTBEAT COULD BE DETECTED AND THAT'S USUALLY AROUND SIX WEEKS, USUALLY BEFORE MOST WOMEN EVEN KNOW THEY ARE PREGNANT.

WE WILL FOLLOW THAT FOR YOU. > MORE BREAKING NEWS AS WELL, MOMENTS AGO GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP FINISHED TESTIFYING ABOUT THE ERECTION PROBE IN HIS STATE OF GEORGIA, AND HE WALKED IN ABOUT 9:00 AND WALKED OUT ABOUT 5 1/2 HOURS LATER. IT COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PAYBACK WHO HAS BEEN A FAVORITE TARGET OF DONALD TRUMP.  WE WON GEORGIA BY A LOT, AND WE HAVE A REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR THAT IS WORSE THAN A DEMOCRAT. HE'S TERRIBLE.  BRIAN KEMP IS A TURN COAT AND A COWARD AND COMPLETE DISASTER. LYIN' BRIAN OF GEORGIA IS TERRIBLE.  THAT'S POLITICS. BUT TODAY UNDER OATH WITH LEGAL IMPLICATIONS LOOMING, KEMP, WHO HAD HIS SAY, AND IT MATTERS BECAUSE HE'S THE HIGHEST PROFILE GEORGIA OFFICIAL TO TESTIFY BEFORE THE SPECIAL GRAND JURY THAT COULD CONCLUDE WITH CRIMINAL CHARGES AGAINST TRUMP. AND I WANT TO BRING IN BLAYNE ALEXANDER, AND THIS IS A BIG DEAL. HE JUST FINISHED TESTIFYING. WHAT DO WE KNOW?  Reporter: THIS WAS THE CULMINATION OF THE LENGTHY BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S LEGAL TEAM AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY. HE CAME IN AROUND 9:00, AND LEFT AROUND NOON. HE DID LEAVE THE BUILDING, WE CONFIRMED, AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SEVERAL HOURS OF TESTIMONY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND WILL REMAIN LARGELY A SECRET, BECAUSE, OF COURSE, IT'S A GRAND JURY. WHAT WE KNOW IS WHAT THE D.A. WANTED TO LEARN FROM THE TESTIMONY, AND ALL OF IT GOES BACK TO THE CONVERSATIONS WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND HIS CAMPAIGN HAVING TO DO WITH THE ELECTION RESULTS HERE IN GEORGIA IN THE 2020 ELECTION. HE WANTS TO KNOW IF HE WAS PRESSURED, AND WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED ON THE OTHER SIDE. WE KNOW ABOUT THE PUBLIC SPLIT THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT. WHAT THE D.A. WANTS TO FIND OUT, OF COURSE, IS THE CONVERSATIONS. WHAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT, CHRIS, IS THIS PUTS US INTO THE LARGER CONTEXT OF WHERE THIS INVESTIGATION STANDS NOW. WE KNOW THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IS AGGRESSIVE IN THIS INVESTIGATION. WE KNOW SHE SAID SHE HOPES TO WRAP IT UP BY THE END OF THE YEAR, AND NOW THAT WE HAVE SEEN ESSENTIALLY ALL OF THE HIGH PROFILE GEORGIA OFFICIALS TESTIFY, WE KNOW SHE'S SEEKING TESTIMONY FROM NEWT GINGRICH, AND LINDSEY GRAHAM AND MARK MEADOWS AND OTHER, AND WILL SHE ISSUE THE SUBPOENA OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT HIMSELF, AND SHE'S NOT RULING OUT THAT OPTION, CHRIS.  THANK YOU FOR THAT. > GRAPHIC AND EMOTIONAL TESTIFY TESTIMONY IN AN L.A. COURTROOM WITH THE FIRST LADY OF CALIFORNIA TAKING THE STAND AGAINST HARVEY WEINSTEIN. SHE BROKE DOWN CRYING WHILE TELLING JURORS ABOUT THE NIGHT SHE SAYS WEINSTEIN ASSAULTED HER IN A HOTEL SUITE. THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY SAID IT'S ALL A LIE, AND SHE WOULD BE, QUOTE, ANOTHER ONE THAT WANTED TO GET AHEAD. LOOK, THE DEFENSE CALLED THE ACCUSER A BIMBO, AND IT'S A STRIKING EXAMPLE OF THE OLD SCHOOL PLAY VICTIM, ATTACK THE VICTIM, OR THE ALLEGED VICTIM. AS THE ME TOO MOVEMENT HAVE THE JURORS LESS LIKELY TO BUY THAT ARGUMENT?  I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION THE ME TOO MOVEMENT WAS A LARGE PART OF THE AVALANCHE OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST HARVEY WEINSTEIN TOOK PLACE, AND SHE HAS A LITTLE EXTRA CREDIBILITY BECAUSE OF BEING THE FIRST LADY OF CALIFORNIA, AND THE PROSECUTION CAN OVERSTEP ITS CONFIDENCE IN THAT, AND THE DEFENSE HAS TO DO WHAT IT CAN TO CALL INTO QUESTION HER CREDIBILITY SO THE JURORS SAY, WELL, YOU KNOW, SHE MAY BE THE FIRST LADY, BUT I AM NOT CONVINCED AND THEREFORE I AM NOT GOING TO FIND THE DEFENDANT GUILTY ON THAT CHARGE. A VERY TOUGH ROAD FOR THE DEFENSE HERE JUST BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME OF EVIDENCE AGAINST HARVEY WEINSTEIN.  YEAH, THE NUMBERS OF ACCUSER, AND AS YOU SAY, A HIGH PROFILE PERSON, THE FIRST LADY OF CALIFORNIA. YOU ALSO HAVE A FAMOUS HOLLYWOOD PRODUCER. WHEN YOU ARE GO INTO A TRIAL LIKE THIS, CAROL, HOW DOES THAT FAME PLAY A ROLE? IS THAT BUILT INTO THE STRATEGY, THE IDEA THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE JURY WILL KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND EVEN THEY SAID THEY COULD BE OBJECTIVE, HAVE PRECONCEIVED OBJECTIONS ABOUT THEM.  IN THIS CASE, WE HAVE HEARD THE NAME HARVEY WEINSTEIN IN AN UNFLATTERING LIGHT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS, AND THE ME TOO MOVEMENT HAS DONE A LOT TO EXPOSE THE POWER PLAY THAT TAKES PLACE IN HOLLYWOOD. FOR THE DEFENSE TO ARGUE, AS IT HAS, THAT THIS IS JUST SORT OF PAR FOR THE COURSE CASTING COUCH TYPE OF BEHAVIOR, AND I AM NOT SURE THAT PLAYS THAT WELL TODAY IN TODAY'S ATMOSPHERE, BUT THE DEFENSE DOESN'T HAVE A WHOLE LOT TO WORK WITH. THEY ARE GOING FOR THAT ACQUITTAL, AND ONCE THERE'S AN ACQUITTAL, DOUBLE JEOPARDY ATTACHES AND THEY CAN'T BE HEARD ON THAT AGAIN. > AND DAVID DePAPE FACES ATTEMPTED KIDNAPPING OF A U.S. OFFICIAL, AND THE CHARGES IN ALL CARRY A SENTENCE OF 50 YEARS IN PRISON. THE 42-YEAR-OLD ALREADY PLEADED NOT GUILTY TO STATE CHARGES. WE WILL HAVE UPDATES FROM THE COURTROOM AS WE GET THEM. > A SPOKESPERSON FOR SPOKER PELOSI WHO HAS BEEN INUNDATED WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT HER FUTURE, SAYING SHE HAS NOT THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND WON'T UNTIL ALL THE BALLOTS ARE COUNTED. > IF YOU WERE TO ASSESS YOUR CONFIDENCE THAT THIS IS GOING TO PASS ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 10, WITH 10 BEING ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE, WHERE ARE YOU?  EIGHT OR NINE.  A BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS ON CAPITOL HILL ARE WORKING TO GET MORE REPUBLICAN VOTES AFTER SUBMITTING AN UPDATED AMENDMENT AND PUTTING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE INTO LAW. > AND THEN WHY IS THE RUSSIAN LEADER MIA?

        "trs": "> THE RAGE THAT I'M FEELING THERE ARE ALMOST NOT WORDS TO DESCRIBE JIT BECAUSE THIS OPPORTUNITY WAS SCREWED UP. IT WAS SCREWED UP BADLY, AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO PAY THE TRIS ARE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE COUNTRY IS SCREWED FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS BECAUSE OF THIS. WE'RE GOING TO SEE HORRIBLE LEFT WING JUDGES CONFIRMED FOR TWO YEARS BECAUSE OF THIS. JUDGES TAKING AWAY OUR FREE SPEECH RIGHTS, RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RIGHTS, SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS. IT IS AN ENORMOUS MISSED OPPORTUNITY AND I GOT TO SAY IT IS HARD TO DESCRIBE MY FEELINGS AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN RAGE RIGHT NOW.  HMM. REPUBLICAN SENATOR TED CRUZ --  WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WAS ABOUT? WHO DO YOU THINK THAT WAS AIMED AT?  I FEEL LIKE -- I DON'T KNOW. AIMED AT SOMEONE.  I DON'T KNOW. LET'S BRING IN WILLIE FOR A SECOND.  WILLIE? DO YOU THINK TED'S --  WHAT DO YOU THINK HE WAS UPSET ABOUT? HE WAS SCREWED. I'M JUST SITTING HERE. MAD AT ME?  SWEET TEA.  NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT YOU.  NOT ABOUT ME? I THOUGHT IT WAS SIGH THAT CHIK-FIL-A SWEET TEA IN YOUR HAND?  IT IS.  I BETTE IT IS.  IT IS.  I'M CURIOUS, THOUGH. HE IS VERY UPSET. DO YOU THINK IT'S DONALD TRUMP HE'S UPSET AT? THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT VOTED FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN'T WIN GENERAL ELECTIONS IN SWING STATES? THEY KEEP MAKING THIS MISTAKE.  FEELING RAGE.  I WANT TO UNDERLINE ONE THING THAT THE SENATOR SAID THAT'S SO IMPORTANT. THAT THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY HAVING THIS CELEBRATION LAST WEEK.  WHAT WAS THIS ABOUT?  I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S ABOUT. ARE THEY FROM CANADA NOW OR MINNESOTA? CELEBRATING AND SITTING THERE. WAIT A SECOND. YOUR RADICALISM, YOUR DECISION NOT TO GO ALONG WITH THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND THE MISSISSIPPI 15-WEEK BAN, THAT IS NOW PUT JOE BIDEN IN A POSITION AND TED CRUZ IS EXACTLY RIGHT HERE. JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO APPOINT A HISTORIC NUMBER OF FEDERAL JUDGES IN THIS FIRST TERM. HE IS ALREADY ON PACE TO DO THAT AND NOW NO SPEED BUMPS WHATEVER. HE GETS TO APPOINT WHOEVER HE WANTS TO APPOINT AND THIS SHOWS AGAIN -- CHECKS AND BALANCES. ET CETERA. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS. YOU GET TOO RADICAL FOR THE MIDDLE OF AMERICA, THEN THE OTHER SIDE IS REWARDED. IT SEEMS TO ME HERE THAT TED CRUZ IS RIGHT BUT REPUBLICANS AND THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY AND A LOT OF SENATORS HAVE ONLY THEMSELVES TO BLAME.  YEAH. AGAINST THE ODDS AND AGAINST HISTORY AND INFLATION AND EVERYTHING ELSE. DEMOCRATS MAY PICK UP A SEAT IN THE SENATE WHICH GETS TO THE POINT OF GETTING THROUGH THE JUDGES THAT THEY WANT. THAT WAS PODCAST TED. HE HAS A PODCAST GETTING WORKED UP AND LEFT OUT DONALD TRUMP IN THAT HOT TAKE BECAUSE HE IS SUBSERVIENT TO HIM. HE IS THAT GUY BEHIND DONALD TRUMP THE ENTIRE TIME AND LEFT THEM OUT OF THE CONVERSATION AND THE TRUMP WING AND DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE ELECTION DENIALISM IN WHICH CRUZ PARTICIPATED RAN OUT A LOT OF GOOD CANDIDATES FROM THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND LEFT THEM WITH LAKE AND MASTERS AND UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT THAT LOST. KEPT THE SENATE IN DEMOCRATIC CONTROL AND MADE THE HOUSE CLOSER THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN.  TED CRUZ IS SITTING NEXT TO HERSCHEL WALKER AND HELPING HIM DO INTERVIEWS. SENATOR CRUZ BLAMED MITCH McCONNELL FOR BLAKE MASTERS' SENATE LOSS IN ARIZONA.  WAIT.  WILL YOU HAVE MORE TEA?  HOW MUCH MONEY DID MITCH SPEND AND WHAT DID DONALD TRUMP DO?  LIKE THIS WITH THE MONEY.  DIDN'T DONALD TRUMP, WILLIE, HOLD TO $100 MILLION? $95 MILLION?  IN PILES.  DIDN'T SPEND ANY OF THAT MONEY. MITCH McCONNELL IS DESPERATELY GOING OUT THERE TRYING TO WIN THE SENATE FOR THE REPUBLICANS. AND DONALD TRUMP ENDS UP SPENDING MORE MONEY AGAINST REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES THIS CYCLE THAN FOR THEM. NOW YOU HAVE HERSCHEL WALKER SAYING, PLEASE STOP USING MY CAMPAIGN TO LOOT MY SUPPORTERS. RIGHT?  YOU SEE THE HEADLINE. $94 MILLION DONALD TRUMP SAT ON AND COULD HAVE USED TO HELP THE CANDIDATES WIN. IT IS JUST LIKE HOW HE AND STEVE BANNON BUILT SUPPORTERS AROUND STOP THE STEAL AND THEY KNEW WASN'T TRUE AND PUT THE MONEY IN THE POCKETS. SAME THING FOR RAISING MONEY THEY SAID FOR CANDIDATES IN IN ELECTION. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LINKS THAT SENT OUT CLICK HERE TO SPRAR BLAKE MASTERS, IT TURNS OUT THAT DONALD TRUMP SIPHONED OFF A LOT OF THAT MONEY AND NOT A LOT ENDED UP IN THE POCKETS OF CANDIDATES THEMSELVES.  I'VE BEEN SAYING THAT DONALD TRUMP --  EVERYONE KNOWS THAT HE DOES THIS.  THE GEM IN TAMMY FAYE BAKER OF AMERICAN POLITICS. CAMPAIGNED AGAINST REPUBLICANS HE HATED. AND THEN LOOK AT THE MONEY THAT HE SPENT. IT IS CRAZY. THOSE NUMBERS ADD UP TO MORE THAN THE ONES THAT HE DISLIKED AND PRETTY CLOSE. SAT ON $95 MILLION. YOU WONDER WHAT POINT DO PEOPLE FIGURE OUT THEY'RE PTL'd HERE. YOU HAD STEVE BANNON ALSO, WILLIE, TALKING ABOUT THE STOP THE STEAL STUFF. STEVE BANNON GOT CONVICTED FOR I BELIEVE FOR LYING ABOUT A BUILD THE WALL FUND. HE SOAKED PEOPLE OF MONEY. SAID IT WAS GOING TO GO TO BUILDING THE WALL. FOUND GUILTY. DONALD TRUMP GAVE HIM A PARDON AND NOW LYING ABOUT STOPPING THE STEAL AND HELPING THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES AND ALL HE IS DOING IS TAKING MONEY AWAY FROM REPUBLICANS. HERSCHEL WALKER NOW SEEING THIS IN A VERY CLEAR LIGHT AND BEGGING HIM AND JD VANCE AND OTHERS. STOP STEALING MONEY FROM US AND SAYING YOU ARE RAISING MONEY FROM US. WHEN YOU GIVE US ONE DOLLAR AND YOU KEEP NINE.  PUSHING THE CANDIDATES ON THE PARTY. WALKER, OZ, MASTERS. DOESN'T SUPPORT THEM. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO WALKER BUT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING WE THOUGHT THAT HE COULD BE THE CONTROLLING VOTE TO CONTROL THE SENATE. THAT IS NOT TRUE ANYMORE.  IF YOU WANT TO KNOW, MIKA, WHETHER SOMEBODY IS SERIOUS ABOUT FIXING THINGS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, HELPING REPUBLICANS MOVE TOWARD WINNING, IF THEY'RE BLAMING MITCH McCONNELL FOR WHAT WENT WRONG OVER THE PAST WEEK AND NOT SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, REGARDLESS OF YOUR IDEOLOGY AND WHETHER YOU THINK MITCH McCONNELL IS TOO MUCH OF AN INSIDER, MITCH McCONNELL IS WORKING NOW FOR FOUR YEARS TO BECOME MAJORITY LEADER AGAIN. DONALD TRUMP, EVERYBODY KNOWS IT, GOT IN THE WAY IN GEORGIA IN 2020. HELPED PUT CHUCK SCHUMER IN. SPENT TWO YEARS TRYING TO RAISE MONEY AND GET THE RIGHT CANDIDATES. DONALD TRUMP CAME IN WITH BAD CANDIDATES AND MITCH McCONNELL'S THE ONE TO RAISE MONEY. HE SAVED JD VANCE. HE SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ALL ACROSS THE STATES WHERE DONALD TRUMP AGAIN JUST CHOSE THE WEAKEST OF CANDIDATES. TRUMP DIDN'T PUT THE MONEY IN THERE. IF YOU SAY I'M MAD. I WANT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO WIN AGAIN AND BLAMING MITCH McCONNELL INSTEAD OF DONALD TRUMP WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS CREATING A CYCLE THAT'S LED TO LOSSES IN 2018, 2019, 2020 AND 2022. DEMOCRATS THINK IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THE CYCLE GOING AND BLAME THE WRONG PEOPLE AND DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT THE CANCER GROWING INSIDE THE PARTY SINCE 2016 STEALING YOUR MONEY, DEMOCRATS ARE LIKE DO THAT.  YEAH. A CYCLE OF LOSERDOM. > DONALD TRUMP IS TEASING A BIG ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY. WE COULD SEE WHETHER HE PLANS TO LAUNCH A 2024 CAMPAIGN. KARI LAKE LOST FOR ARIZONA GOVERNOR. YOU KNOW WHO I FEEL BAD MORE? WE HAVE MIKE AND EUGENE WITH US.  SHE WAS REALLY MEAN TO HIM.  CALLED HIM A BASTARD.  POINTING THE FINGERS. I WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO --  YEAH.  I FELT BAD FOR HIM. HE WEATHERED THE STORM.  HE ASKED THE QUESTIONS.  BUT SHE WAS SO MEAN TO HIM.  I FELT BAD.  ARE YOU DOING OKAY? SHE WAS AWFULLY MEAN TO YOU. CALLED YOU A BASTARD. SAID THAT LIKE -- I THINK YOU WERE BAD OR WE WERE BAD FOR AMERICA.  EVIL.  BAD FOR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.  ALWAYS IN YOUR FACE.  HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS MORNING? ARE YOU FEELING OKAY, VAUGHN?  I THINK WE WERE IN THE SAME CAMP AND MADE SENSE TO BE HERE TODAY WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT. COULD I SAY SOMETHING ABOUT KARI LAKE?  YEAH. GO FOR IT.  Reporter: OKAY. LOOK. COVERED KARI LAKE FOR A BETTER PART OF A YEAR AND A HALF HERE AND FINALLY FLEW YESTERDAY FROM ARIZONA HERE AND ESSENTIALLY FELT LIKE I WAS COVERING DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN OF 2024 BUT IN ARIZONA. SHE PREDICATED THE CAMPAIGN TRYING TO SELL THE BIG LIE AND THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES WHEN SHE WONDERS HOW SHE LOST THE RACE, THIRD ELECTION CYCLE THAT ARIZONANS REJECTED TRUMPISM. WHO DID SHE CAMPAIGN ALONGSIDE? STEVE BAN NORTHERN, AN INDIVIDUAL WHO PROMOTED THE NOTION OF THE WAR ON WHITE PEOPLE AND STATE SENATOR ROGERS WHO WAS HERE IN FLORIDA SPEAKING AT A WHITE NATIONALIST CONFERENCE AELG CALLED THE DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT A PERVERT, SUGGESTED TO BE PERP WALKS FOR INDIVIDUALS. THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO CELEBRATING PUTTING A DAGGER INTO THE McCAIN MACHINE. ASSERTED THAT CINDY McCAIN WANTS TO END DEMOCRACY. SHE SUGGESTED PAUL GOSART THE PAL TIRN THAT THE FOUNDERS ENVISIONED. WAS SHE ABLE TO MAKE THAT SELL HERE? THE ANSWER IS NO. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SLATE OF ELECTION DENIERS SHE WAS THE LATEST ONE TO FALL MAKING IT A CLEAN SWEEP OF THOSE CANDIDATES AND SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDATES AND NOW DONALD TRUMP WILL TRY TO RUN ON THE MESSAGE THAT THEY LOST ON.  VAUGHN, TELL US, YES, SHE DID LOSE. A CLOSE RACE. TALK ABOUT HOW CLOSE AMERICA CAME TO HAVING A GOVERNOR IN A SWING STATE THAT BY ALL ACCOUNTS, EVERYBODY OUT THERE SAYING THAT SHE WAS ACTUALLY AN ARTICULATE VERSION OF DONALD TRUMP AND SMOOTHER, MORE SAVVY, KNEW HOW TO WORK ROOMS, SHE CAMPAIGNED ALL OVER THE PLACE. DEMOCRATS WERE VERY SCARED OF THIS WOMAN IN A WAY THEY HAD NOT BEEN SCARED OF ANY POLITICAL CANDIDATE I HAD SEEN SINCE DONALD TRUMP'S EMERGENCE IN 2015. THEY THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING TO WIN AND GOING TO BE THE HEIR APPARENT TO DONALD TRUMP.  Reporter: SHE WAS ALL THOSE THINGS. THIS IS GIVING AWAY MY AGE HERE BUT I GREW UP WATCHING KARI LAKE ON THE NEWS. SHE WAS THE FACE OF PHOENIX TELEVISION. IF ANYBODY WERE REFUNED TO PRESENT THE DONALD TRUMP MESSAGE MORE CLEANLY IT WAS KARI LAKE HERE AND THE DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT OF KATIE HOBBS NEVER WENT TOE TO TOE ON THE DEBATE STAGE. SOMEBODY WHO A GREAT MANY FOLKS HESITANT TO SUPPORT, A STRAIGHT FORWARD DEMOCRAT. AND YET WHAT HAPPENED WITH ARIZONA VOTERS THEY WERE PAYING ATTENTION. AND A LOCAL LEADER, A CHAIRWOMAN, A VERY NITTY-GRITTY ACTIVIST TYPES COMING FROM THE McCAIN ERA AND THREE DAYS AFTER LAKE'S PRIMARY VICTORY AND THEY TWEETED THAT SHE WAS THE DEMOGRAPHIC THEY DIDN'T NEED AND IT WAS THE McCAIN REPUBLICANS THAT THEY DIDN'T NEED. LOOKING AT A 20,000 VOTE DIFFERENCE IS THAT'S WHO KARI LAKE NEEDED. WHERE DOES THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN PARTY GO? KARI LAKE TWEETED OUT LAST NIGHT THAT ARIZONANS KNOW BS.  SHE SAID FOUR DAYS BEFORE ELECTION DAY McCAIN REPUBLICANS IN THE ROOM GET THE HELL OUT AND CALLING HIM A LOSER IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA. THAT ANNOUNCEMENT EXPECTED TONIGHT THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL ANNOUNCE THE CANDIDACY. WHAT DO WE EXPECT?  Reporter: WIN, SO MANY TRUMP ENDORSED CANDIDATES LOST. SAME TIME LOOKING AT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY GOING TO BE SERVING IN THE NEXT CONGRESS AND AROUND THE COUNTRY YOU DON'T HAVE CHENEY AND TOM RICE. YOU WERE LOOKING AT A REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT IS MUCH MORE IN THE MOLD OF DONALD TRUMP. THAT IS THE BACKDROP TO WHICH HE SEES HIMSELF ANNOUNCING HIS 2024 PRESIDENTIAL RUN TONIGHT. HE HAS A SMALLER CAMPAIGN OPERATION. HE'S CONFIDENT THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERCUT THE CANDIDACIES OF RON DESANTIS AND LOOKING AT WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO HAUL IN THE RESOURCES TO CHALLENGE HIM HE'S GOT A POINT TO BE MADE BUT THE QUESTION IS, IS THIS GOING TO BE A CAMPAIGN FOCUSED ON THE GRIEVANCES? IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRUE SOCIAL ACCOUNT HE POSTED 64 DIFFERENT MEMES. THE IDEA TO ARISE HERE AND TAKE CONTROL BACK. THE QUESTION IS VOTERS AROUND THE COUNTRY REJECTED THE PREMISE OF WHAT HE EXPECTED TO BE THE 2024 CAMPAIGN. I WAS AT RALLIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WITH HIM. YOU SAW THE CANDIDATES WILLINGLY STAND ON THE STAGE WITH HIM. IS HE ABLE TO DO SO? IS HE ABLE TO CUT A CONTRAST TO SOMEHOW RESONATE WITH REPUBLICAN VOTERS SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE POLITICAL INFLUENCE HERE?  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR REPORTING. WE APPRECIATE IT. TALKING TO YOU AGAIN SOON. > 14 HOUSE RACES UNCALLED THIS MORNING. 11 ARE IN CALIFORNIA. OVERALL DEMOCRATS HAVE 206 SEATS SO FAR. REPUBLICANS HAVE WON 215. NBC NEWS ESTIMATES DEMOCRATS WIN 115 AND REPUBLICANS 220 WITH A MARGIN OF PLUS OR MINUS 3. 210 IS NEEDED TO WIN THE MAJORITY. JOINING US NOW ONE ELECTION THAT'S COMPLETELY DONE AND WON FRESH OFF THE RE-ELECTION WIN DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN ELISSA SLOTKIN OF MICHIGAN. CONGRATULATIONS.  THANK YOU.  TO WHAT DO YOU POINT YOUR WIN? HOW MUCH IS LIZ CHENEY'S ENDORSEMENT A FACTOR?  WE WON BECAUSE IN GENERAL IN MICHIGAN WE HAVE A TIPPING POINT THAT PEOPLE DON'T WANT EXTREMISTS AS LEADERS. MY DISTRICT IS A REPUBLICAN LEANING DISTRICT AND WILL SPLIT THE TICKET AND VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT IF THE PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE IS SHOWN TO BE MORE EXTREME. I THINK THAT IS HAPPENING ALL OVER MICHIGAN AND THE COUNTRY. WE BROUGHT LIZ CHENEY IN BECAUSE SHE WAS GENEROUS AND OFFERED AND HAD HERB COME IN. IT RAISED MYSELF AND MY OPPONENT AND DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU SMOOTH IT OVER LATER. IF YOU ARE EXTREME ON THINGS LIKE ABORTION PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT. I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR MAKING THAT CLEAR. WE HAD OUR BEST ELECTION YET. IT WAS A GREAT NIGHT.  CONGRESSWOMAN, LET'S SET THE DOBBS DECISION ASIDE. IT WAS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR. TALK ABOUT MICHIGAN AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH YOUR RACE IN MICHIGAN AND FLIPPING THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT CAUSED THAT CONFLUENCE OF EVENTS TO OCCUR SUCCESSFULLY?  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT POINT FOR ANYONE THAT CARES ABOUT DEMOCRACY AND CERTAINLY FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS HAVING A GREAT NIGHT AND WHAT LED UP TO THE NIGHT IS HAVING A PLAN. WE HAD A PLAN AND IN MICHIGAN IN 2016 THE STATE WENT FOR TRUMP. WE STARTED THEN LOOKING AT OURSELVES AND SAYING WHAT IS THIS ABOUT? WHERE DID THIS COME FROM? HOW DO WE REBUILD? IN 2018 WE GOT RID OF GERRYMANDERING ON THE BALLOT INITIATIVE. I ENCOURAGE EVERY STATE TO DO THAT TO LOOK AT THAT. WE RAN STRONG CAMPAIGNS. WE EXPANDED THE RIGHT TO VOTE THROUGH BALLOT INITIATIVES IN 2018 AND 2020. THAT LED TO A PLACE WHERE WE FLIPPED BOTH LEGISLATURES AND HAVE THE GOVERNORSHIP WHICH HASN'T HAPPENED IN OVER 60 YEARS IN MICHIGAN. I THINK THE LESSON IS BE HONEST. THE DOBBS DECISION IS TERRIBLE FOR WOMEN AND GLAD IT MOTIVATED PEOPLE TO COME OUT. WOMEN IN THE RED STATES DOESN'T HAVE A RIGHT TO ABORTION BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A PLAN DEALING WITH EXTREMISTS SHOULD BE THE TAKEAWAY FROM THE LAST ELECTION.  I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE LIZ CHENEY ENDORSEMENT FOR A SECOND. WAS THERE BLOW BACK AT ALL THAT YOU PERCEIVED FROM DEMOCRATS WHO SAID, HOLD ON. SHE IS PRETTY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN. OR, WERE DEMOCRATS DOWN WITH THAT? DID THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THIS WAS SORT OF A COALITION IN FAVOR OF DEMOCRACY AS OPPOSED TO AN IDEOLOGICAL THING?  YEAH. I THINK MAYBE THIS IS A MID WESTERN THING. I DON'T KNOW. THERE WAS NOT BLOWBACK FROM DEMOCRATS. WE ACKNOWLEDGED LIZ AND I ON MOST POLICY ISSUES THAT WE ARE ON DIFFERENT SIDES AND HAD VOCIFEROUS DEBATE AND AGREE ON A BIG THING WHICH IS DEMOCRACY AND IN MICHIGAN WE ARE PRAGMATISTS, REASONABLE PEOPLE THAT WANT GOVERNMENT TO FUNCTION AND BELIEVE IN THE DEMOCRACY AND UNDERSTOOD AND ACTUALLY HAS A MISH GANDER WE GROW UP WHERE MY DAD WAS A REPUBLICAN. MY MOM WAS A DEMOCRAT. THERE WAS NO DRET OF A DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN ON A STAGE SHARING IT TOGETHER TALKING ABOUT WHERE WE DISAGREE. THAT IS HOW THE COUNTRY FUNCTIONS AT ITS BEST. SO I DID NOT FEEL BLOWBACK. I GOT QUESTIONS FROM STRATEGISTS AND CONSULTANTS OF SHOULD YOU BRING IT IN. MY DISTRICT IS REPUBLICAN LEANING BUT GOT TO HAVE FAITH IN THE VOTERS AND JUST ROLL THE DICE WE CARE MORE ABOUT THE COUNTRY FUNCTIONING THAN ABOUT THE SORT OF HEADLINES OF THE DAY AND GLAD WE DID IT AND PROVED TO BE RIGHT.  HAVE FAITH IN THE VOTERS. SUCH AN IMPORTANT THING TO SAY BECAUSE YOU USUALLY WON'T BE LET DOWN IF YOU DO. SO CONGRESSWOMAN, WE HEARD OF KEVIN McCARTHY REACHING OUT TO DEMOCRATS. WE HAVE HEARD ABOUT THE IN-FIGHTING ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE NEXT LEADER OF THE HOUSE. IF WE SEE THE HOUSE GOING OVER TO THE REPUBLICANS, IT WILL BE BY THE SMALLEST OF MARGINS. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE NEXT TWO YEARS LOOK LIKE?  WE KEPT SOME OF THE WORST IMPULSES TO MATERIALIZE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. IF THEY BLEW US OUT WE WOULD HAVE SEEN EXTREME LEGISLATION GOING THROUGH AND WOULD HAVE STOPPED NOW IN THE SENATE OR WITH THE VETO AND USED IT AS A MOMENT TO MESSAGE ON THE FAVORITE EXTREME ISSUES. WE HAVE A PARTY TRYING TO REALIZE HOW TO DEAL WITH THE FACT IN PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE SWING STATE THEY LOST AND THE VOTERS CAME OUT MORE PRACTICAL THAN THE LEADERS AND NOW HAVING TO FIGURE OUT AN AGENDA THAT HELPS US WIN IN THESE KEY PLACES. YOU CAN'T WIN IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WITHOUT SWING STATES AND A POSITIVE THING. I HOPE THAT THIS IS A TIPPING POINT WHERE THEY SAY THAT MAGA EXTREMIST THING IS NOT WINNING FOR US TO PUSH IT ASIDE AND GOT TO HAVE THE STRENGTH AND THE BACKBONE TO DO THAT. WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT A LOT IN THE PAST AND I HOPE IT HELPS TO CREATE THAT TIPPING POINT.  CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU FOR BEING ON THE SHOW THIS MORNING.  OF COURSE. THANK YOU. > STILL AHEAD ON \"MORNING JOE,\" UKRAINE PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY'S MESSAGE TO WORLD LEADERS AS THE WAR DOMINATES THE CONVERSATION AT THE G20 CONFERENCE. > JOSH SHAPIRO WILL BE HERE.

        "trs": " AT 7:32 PM ON SATURDAY NIGHT, AS WE EAGERLY AWAITED THE RESULTS OF THE SENATE ELECTION IN NEVADA THAT COULD GIVE CONTROL OF THE SENATE TO THE DEMOCRATS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS APARTHEID JEN PSAKI SAID THIS.  EVERYBODY IN THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW IS HOLDING THEIR BREATH, READY TO ISSUE A BIG SIGH OF RELIEF IF YOU GET SOME RESULTS TONIGHT, BECAUSE IT'S GONNA CHANGE THE NEXT TWO YEARS FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN. I MEAN, IT'LL CHANGE THEY GOT CONFIRMED, IT'LL CHANGE CUTTING JUDGES CONFIRMED, WHICH IS A HUGE PART OF HIS LEGACY, I CAN PLEATED SESSION OF RON KLAIN'S, AND THEY'RE WAITING FOR THE RESULTS TO COME. IN THIS CHANGES THE VIBE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS, AND EVEN YEARS.  AND, ONE HOUR AND 45 MINUTES LATER, THIS HAPPENED.  THAT IS RIGHT ON THE NUMBERS SHE'S BEEN GETTING. THAT'S RIGHT WHAT DEMOCRATS ARE EXPECTING. YOU SEE IT'S NOT BEEN UPDATED IN OUR SYSTEM. AND SO, STATEWIDE, THERE IT IS. FOR THE FIRST TIME NONSENSE ELECTION NIGHT, CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO IS PAST ADAM LAXALT, HAS MOVED INTO THE LEAGUE. IT'S ESSENTIALLY A 5000 VOTE LEAD, 4982 VOTES. THAT'S KATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO'S ADVANTAGE STATEWIDE. ONE HALF OF 1%. SHE MOVES INTO THE LEAGUE AGAIN. THIS IS IT IN TERMS OF MAIL BALLOTS AND CLARK COUNTY. THEY SAID TONIGHT WOULD BE THE LAST NIGHT. THAT'S THE FINAL BATCH. WE GOT 22,000-PLUS RIGHT THERE. IT HAS TOTALLY CHANGED THE LEADERBOARD IN THIS RACE. MASTO I HAD BY ABOUT 5000 VOTES. AND AS THEY SAY, WHAT IS TO COME NOW? I BELIEVE -- I BELIEVE THAT MAYBE, WITH VERY -- THERE IT IS. THAT'S THE CHECK MARK. CORTEZ MASTO DECLARED BY OUR DECISION DESK THE WINNER OF THE NEVADA SENATE RACE, WITH KATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO'S VICTORY AND THEN BY THAT SENATE RACE, DEMOCRATS NOW HAVE CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE IN SHORT. THEY HAVE THEIR 50 SEATS, WITH KAMALA HARRIS CASTING THE TIE BREAKING VOTE, THE GUARANTEES DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF THE SENATE FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS.  JOINING US NOW IN THE WINNERS CIRCLE IS WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF RON KLAIN. RON, JEN PSAKI SAID THAT WIN WOULD PUT A SKIP IN YOUR STEP. SO, THANK YOU FOR SKIPPING OVER TO OUR MICROPHONE THIS EVENING FOR THIS DISCUSSION.  AND THANK YOU FOR NOT SHOWING ME SKIPPING. I APPRECIATE THAT.  WE HAVE THAT VIDEO FOR LATER. WE'LL SHOW THAT LATER. RON, WHAT WAS THAT MOMENT LIKE FOR ALL OF YOU IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR WAITING FOR IT?  WELL, OBVIOUSLY, ENORMOUSLY SIGNIFICANT. HISTORICALLY, THIS IS SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS DONE SINCE JOHN F. KENNEDY, TO HOLD SENATE SEATS AND POTENTIALLY EVEN GO UP ONE SENATE SEAT, PENDING THE OUTCOME IN GEORGIA. TOOK CONTROL OF THE SENATE, WHICH WILL INDEED ALLOW THE PRESIDENT TO PASS LEGISLATION IN THE SENATE, AND OF COURSE, GET PEOPLE CONFIRMED. AND IN SOME WAYS, IT'S PERHAPS -- HISTORICAL PURPOSES, THE IDEA TO GET OUR JUDICIAL NOMINEES CONFIRMED BY A DEMOCRATIC SENATE. AND SO, THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT LEGACIES OF ANY PRESIDENT. AND A VERY IMPORTANT LEGACY TO THIS PRESIDENT. AND SO, -- KEEPING CONTROL OF THE SENATE IS JUST AN UNBELIEVABLE MOMENT.  YOU MENTIONED THE CANDIDATE PRESIDENCY. THAT MIDTERM IS 60 YEARS AGO. AND WE KNOW THAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE, THE PRESIDENT, THE VICE PRESIDENT, AND THE WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF ALL PARTICIPATE IN BOTH GOVERNING AND POLITICAL CAMPAIGNING ISSUES AND STRATEGIZING AND CONSIDERATIONS. THAT MEANS THAT RON KLAIN IS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRATIC WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF IN A MIDTERM FIRST MIDTERM ELECTION SINCE 1962. THE JOB THAT YOU HELD THEN WAS THEN HELD BY KENNETH O'DONNELL, NOT ADMITTED TO ME -- RELATED TO ME IN ANY WAY, FROM MASSACHUSETTS. WHAT'S IT LIKE FOR YOU PERSONALLY? A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE WATCHING THE JOB YOU ARE DOING OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND OVER THE LAST YEAR, QUESTIONING HOW YOU ARE HANDLING THAT SHOP. WHAT DOES THIS VICTORY MEAN FOR YOU?  WHAT IT MEANS IS I WORK WITH AN INCREDIBLY TALENTED GROUP OF PEOPLE. STARTING OFF WITH -- DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF IN -- PRESIDENT CHIEF STRATEGIST, MIKE TOMLIN, HIS CHIEF COMMUNICATION GURRIA, I NEEDED DON, STEVE CHATTY, A LEGISLATIVE TEAM -- YOU JUST -- WHO CAME IN TO OVERSEE OUR OUTREACH IN ADVANCE OF THIS ELECTION YEAR. SO, I'M LUCKY TO WORK WITH AN AMAZINGLY DIVERSE TEAM OF PEOPLE, AND AMAZINGLY TALENTED TEAM OF PEOPLE, AND AMAZINGLY DEDICATED TEAM OF PEOPLE, AND THEY CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, JUST WORK NIGHT AND DAY TO HELP DELIVER THIS RESULT.  ONE THING THE PRESIDENT SAID AT THE VERY END OF THE PRESS CONFERENCE TODAY IS THAT THIS WIN, APPARENTLY, DOES NOT MEAN CODIFYING ROE VERSUS WADE. LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT EXACTLY HE SAID.  I DON'T THINK THERE'S ENOUGH VOTES TO CODIFY, UNLESS SOMETHING HAPPENS UNUSUAL IN THE HOUSE. I THINK WE'LL GET VERY CLOSE IN THE HOUSE, BUT I THINK IT'S GONNA BE VERY CLOSE. BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT.  SO, RON, DOES NOT MEAN THAT IF THE DEMOCRATS WON'T ACTUALLY END UP WINNING THE HOUSE, THAT THERE STILL WON'T BE AN ATTEMPT TO CODIFY ROE V. WADE?  LOOK, I THINK WE'RE GONNA TAKE A SOFT SHOT AT. CERTAINLY, ABSOLUTELY, IF THE DEMOCRATS WIN THE HOUSE, -- I THINK WHAT THE PRESIDENT WAS REFLECTING THERE IS JUST UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHERE THE HOUSE IS GONNA END UP RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE AN UNDER DOG IN THE HOUSE BEFORE THE ELECTION, OR AN UNDERDOG NOW AS THE VOTES ARE BEING COUNTED, BUT THERE STILL A PATH TO 2:18 FOR THE DEMOCRATS. SO WE'RE GONNA KEEP OUR FINGERS AND TOES CROSSED HERE TO SEE IF THAT'S HOW THE COUNT COMES OUT. THE PRESIDENT MADE IT CLEAR THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN THAT WE'RE GONNA DO EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO PROTECT WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. WE'LL USE OUR EXECUTIVE TIME POWERS TO PROTECT THE WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. IT'S ALREADY TAKEN SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS IN THAT REGARD IN TERMS OF THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL, IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THE ABORTION PILL, WHICH IS THE WAY MOST WOMEN ACCESS THE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, IS AVAILABLE IN ALL 50 STATES. MAKING SURE THE HOSPITAL PERFORMS URGENCY PROCEDURES. BUT IN TERMS OF LEGISLATIVE ACTION, THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY DETERMINE WHERE THE VOTE COUNT ENDS UP, AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW.  ELIZABETH WARREN TODAY IS SAYING THAT THE SENATE AND HOUSE SHOULD COME BACK INTO SESSION BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. AND AMONG OTHER THINGS, PASS SOME INCREASE IN THE DEBT CEILING SO THAT REPUBLICANS, IF THEY CONTROL THE HOUSE NEXT YEAR, CAN NOT HOLD THE DEBT CEILING HOSTAGE. WHAT'S THE PRESIDENTS POSITION ON THAT?  FIRST OF ALL, AGAIN, AS I JUST EXPLAINED, WE'RE NOT SURE WHO'S GETTING CONTROL OF THE HOUSE NEXT YEAR. BUT CERTAINLY, I THINK IT'LL BE WISE OF THE CONGRESS COULD TAKE STEPS TO RAISE THE DEBT LIMIT BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR THE KIND OF TAKE IT OFF THE TABLE AND NOT HAVE ANXIETY ABOUT IT NEXT YEAR. BUT THE HOUSE AND SENATE HAVE A BUSY AGENDA IN THIS NEXT SESSION. THEY NEED TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT, OF COURSE. WE JUST LEARNED TODAY THERE'S A BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT TO PROTECT MARRIAGE EQUALITY. WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT GET PASSED -- AND SIGNED INTO LAW. THIS WORK MEETING TO BE DONE ON ELECTORAL REFORM, THE ELECTORAL -- UPDATED SO WE DON'T HAVE A REPEAT OF THE INSANITY WE SAW ON JANUARY 6TH. AND SO, THERE'S A BIG AGENDA HERE. WE'RE GONNA SEE HOW THINGS SORTED OUT THE NEXT THREE WEEKS AND TRY TO GET AS MUCH OF THAT ON THIS POSSIBLE.  RON, YOU ARE NOW, I THINK, OFFICIALLY THE ONLY PERSON ON TWITTER WHO IS MONITORING GASOLINE PRICES. BACK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER, I THINK EVERY OTHER TWEET I SAW WAS THE SKYROCKETING PRICE OF GASOLINE, AND THAT OBVIOUSLY MEANT THE COLLAPSE OF ANY POSSIBILITY OF DEMOCRATS BEING SUCCESSFUL IN THIS LAST ELECTION. TONIGHT, SINCE WE WON'T GIVE UP, HE SAID THE GRASS PRICES FELL LAST NIGHT -- DOWN FROM LAST WEEK, ABOUT HALF THE STATES ARE NOW $3.59 OR LOWER. WHAT IS -- AND THAT IS ONE OF THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF INFLATION THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH. WHAT IS THE PRESIDENTS POSITION GOING FORWARD ON WHAT HE THINKS HE CAN DO, EVEN IF THERE IS A REPUBLICAN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN TERMS OF WRESTLING WITH INFLATION?  WELL, I THINK WITH INFLATION OVERALL, YOU KNOW, THE TOP OF OUR LIST OBVIOUSLY IS CONTINUING TO UNTIE SUPPLY CHAINS. YOU'VE SEEN THE PRICE OF GOOD STARTING TO FALL NOW IN THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. THAT'S THE PRODUCT OF THE WORK WE'VE DONE ALREADY AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO TO IMPROVE SUPPLY CHAINS SO GOODS GET TO CONSUMERS IS HERE, AND THE COST OF THAT COMES DOWN. WE'RE STARTING TO SEE HIM SOME BRAKE INFLATION AROUND FRUIT. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON. AND OF COURSE, AS HE SAID, GASOLINE PRICES MATTER. I KNOW WHAT MATTERS TO PEOPLE. I KNOW IT'S A VERY VISIBLE PRICE. IT REALLY IMPACTS YOUR ABILITY -- YOUR HOUSEHOLD BUDGET, AND YOUR SENSE OF YOUR HOUSEHOLD BUDGET. AND SO, WE CONTINUE THE PROCESS THE SALES. WE'VE ORDERED FROM THE PETROLEUM RESERVE, WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OIL INDUSTRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THE BARREL PRICE OF OIL COMES DOWN, THE GALLON PRICE OF GASOLINE FALLS AS WELL. WE'RE SEEING A LARGER GAP THAN USUAL ON THAT. THAT'S A REASON WHY THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN PRESSING SO HARD TO GET THAT PRICE OF GASOLINE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, OR PERHAPS ADDITIONALLY, I SHOULD SAY, THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT PASSED BY CONGRESS IN AUGUST DOESN'T REALLY TAKE EFFECT UNTIL JANUARY 1ST. JUST A FEW WEEKS AWAY FROM CONSUMERS SEEING THE PRICE OF INSULIN CAP AT $35 A MONTH. FROM SCENE CHARGES BY DRUG COMPANIES GETTING REBATED BACK TO THE. FROM SEEING THEIR MEDICAID PREMIUMS DROP FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A DECADE. FOR SEEING LOWER COSTS ON ENERGY EFFICIENT SUPPLIES. SO ALL THESE THINGS START TO TAKE EFFECT JUST A FEW WEEKS AWAY FROM NEW YEAR'S DAY.  RAHM, YOU HAVE YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE WORKING ON THE STAFF OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE, ESPECIALLY ON JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS, WHEN YOU'RE ON THE STAFF OF THE JUDICIARY COMMUNITY, WHEN BIDEN WAS CHAIRMAN. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE DEMOCRATS AND FOR THE PRESIDENTS AGENDA IN THE SENATE, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVING 50 DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE, OR 51 DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION IN GEORGIA?  WELL, IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT. I THINK IN TERMS OF MAKING THE SENATE WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY, LOOK. WE'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE. WE'VE PICKED EXCELLENT PEOPLE TO SERVE ON THE FEDERAL BENCH. AND THE VAST MAJORITY, THE RECORD SETTING 86 JUDGES PRESIDENT HAS GOTTEN CONFIRMED HAVE HAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. BUT IN THE FEW CASES WHERE IT'S A PARTY LINE VOTE ONLY, YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN EXTRA VOTE TO GET IT OUT OF THE COMMITTEE WHEN YOU'VE ONLY HAD 50. AND, THE COMMITTEE HEARINGS GO LONG ON ALL THESE THINGS. SO I THINK -- CERTAINLY MAKE IT EASY TO MOVE THINGS IN AN ORDERLY WAY THROUGH THE SENATE. BUT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE, WHETHER WE'RE AT 50 OR 51, WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR OUR NOMINEES, BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR JUDGES, BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR LEGISLATION. THAT WAS ALWAYS JOE BIDEN'S GOAL WHEN HE WAS A SENATOR. IT'S BEEN HIS GOAL AS PRESIDENT, AND AS A SIDE, FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR RECORD SETTING 86 JUDICIAL NOMINEES, THEY'VE HAD THAT BIPARTISAN SUPPORT.  RUN CLAIM, IS WIKIPEDIA INJURY SON NOW INCLUDE THE TITLE MOST SUCCESSFUL -- I GOTTA MAKE SURE I GET THIS RIGHT. MOST SUCCESSFUL DEMOCRATIC WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF IN A FIRST MIDTERM ELECTION SINCE 1962. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT, RON. THAT'S GONNA BE AN ALL YEAR INTRODUCTIONS.

JOINING US NOW, JESSICA POST, PRESIDENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATIVE CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. YOU ARE THE LEADER OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTIES NATIONAL EFFORT TO WIN AT THE STATE LEGISLATURE LEVEL, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OTHER IMPORTANT WINNING STORIES OF THIS CAMPAIGN?  CERTAINLY THE MICHIGAN STATE LEGISLATURE WAS A HUGE WIN, WE WERE SO HAPPY TO FLIP BOTH CHAMBERS THERE, BUT WHAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD IS THAT DEMOCRATS AS THE PARTY IN POWER, WE LOST FEWER LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS, ZERO LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS. THAT IS THE BEST DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE AT THE STATE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL ON A PRESIDENTIAL MIDTERM SINCE FDR, SO WE ARE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT, TYPICALLY MIDTERMS THE PRESIDENTS PARTY LOSE THE SEATS, OR LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS, AND WE WERE ABLE TO BEAT THE ODDS OF A HUGE WHERE THE CYCLE.  THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN AN IMPRESSION THAT THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY IGNORES THE STATE LEGISLATURE, LEVEL, THIS YEAR WHEN WE SEE THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURES ARE NOW IN CONTROL OF ABORTION LAWS IN THIS COUNTRY, WAS IT EASIER TO FOCUS PEOPLES ATTENTION ON THE STATE LEGISLATURE?  I THINK IT WAS STILL DIFFICULT, LAWRENCE, I WISH YOU COULD SAY IT WASN'T EASY, IT WAS SORT OF AN EASY MOVE, BUT I THINK PEOPLE DON'T NECESSARILY UNDERSTAND, AND THE REPUBLICANS REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW POWER WORKS IN THE STATES, AND WE AS DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN BEHIND FOR A LONG TIME WISHING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL COME IN TO SAVE US. BUT ABORTION RIGHTS IS THE RESULT OF STATE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL, THAT IS ALSO TRUE FOR VOTING RIGHTS, AND EDUCATION, AND THE QUALITY OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. SO MANY THINGS ARE RESOLVED IN STATE LEGISLATURES, AND AS YOU KNOW AND MANY OF YOUR OTHER VIEWERS KNOW AFTER THE THOMAS CONCURRENCE ON DOBBS, MORE THINGS LIKE BIRTH CONTROL, THE GRISWOLD CASE, ALL OF THOSE THINGS COULD HAT TO THE STATE. THAT IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR DEMOCRATS TO WIN STATE LEGISLATURES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  IT IS ALSO WITH THE INITIAL TRAINING GROUNDS OF SOME OF THE GREATEST LEADERS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN HISTORY, FROM FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT, TO BARACK OBAMA, TO SENATOR GARY PETERS WHO JUST STARTED US OFF TONIGHT, THEY BEGAN AS STATE LEGISLATURES.  THAT IS 100 PERCENT RIGHT. THE NEW GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA KATIE HOBBS WAS IN THE STATE SENATE WHEN I STARTED MY JOB HERE AT THE EL-SISI, SO IT HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLE PROVING GROUND FOR BARACK OBAMA, STACEY ABRAMS, JON TESTER, CLAIRE MCCASKILL, ALL SORTS OF FOLKS WHO STARTED OFF STATE LEGISLATURES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, IT IS AN INCREDIBLE PROVING GROUND BUT I THINK FOLKS LOOK AT THIS AS MINOR LEAGUES GOING INTO MAJOR LEAGUE WHICH IS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION. MOST OF THE DECISIONS AFFECTING OUR DAY-TO-DAY LIVES, THOSE DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE A STATE LEGISLATURES, AND IT IS PAST TIME FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THAT.  JESSICA POST, IN THE WINNERS CIRCLE, TONIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING, US WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.  THANK, YOU LAWRENCE, APPRECIATE IT.  THANK YOU.

AND YOU WILL NEVER BE TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP IN FEAR OF A GIANT RED WAVE THAT ISN'T COMING. SIMON ROSENBERG WRITES, RED WAVE BECAME A COLLECTIVE -- THAT SINCE TOPS OLIVIA DEMOCRATIC INTENSITY, REPUBLICAN STRAIGHTENED PROMISING THAT IT AND PULLS, STRONG EARLY VOTE WAS DISMISSED, HOPE IT WAS, CALLED ONCE AGAIN, THE PUNGENT SHOWED THE OSCAR WINNING SCREENWRITER -- ABOUT SHOW BUSINESS APPLIES TO THEM. WILLIAM COLEMAN SET OF THE BUSINESS, QUOTE, NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING.  POLITICOS WITH WHO I SPOKE TO TODAY ALL AGREE, AS OF NOW, A MODEST RED WAVE AT THE VERY LEAST SEEMS TO BE BUILDING.  THE SHORT ANSWER IS, IT WILL LOOK GOOD FOR REPUBLICANS, THE LONGER ANSWER IS IT WILL LOOK VERY GOOD FOR THEM.  I FOR ONE NEVER OBSESSED OVER POST IN THE CAMPAIGN, I NEVER REPORTED ON THE GENERIC CONGRESSIONAL BALLOT PULLING BECAUSE I THINK THOSE POLLS ARE MOSTLY USELESS, AND AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS AS LEGENDARY HOUSE SPEAKER -- FAMOUSLY PUT, IT ALL POLITICS IS LOCAL. SO I PERSONALLY GAVE UP TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN IN CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS, A VERY LONG TIME AGO, BUT THIS YEAR WHATEVER THE LATEST POLL SHOWING SOME VERSION OF SO-CALLED BAD NEWS FOR DEMOCRATS CAME, UP I ALWAYS NOTICED THAT ON TWITTER, SIMON ROSENBERG HAD A WISE COUNTER POINT OR, TWO OR MORE TO RAISE ABOVE THOSE NEGATIVE PULLS FOR DEMOCRATS. SIMON ROSENBERG IS NOW WIDELY CREDITED AS THE PERSON WHO WISELY SAW THROUGH WITH THE RED WAVE DILUTION WHEN JUST ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE IN THE PREDICTION GAME FELL FOR IT. JOINING US NOW, FOR A WELL DESERVED VICTORY LAP IS SIMON ROSENBERG, VETERAN -- SUCCESSFUL FIRST PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, AND HE HAS SERVED TOURS OF DUTY AT THE DEMOCRAT NATIONAL COMMITTEE AND DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING, US SIMON, I WANT TO COVER AS MUCH GROUND AS THEY CAN TO CONVINCE PEOPLE TO STOP OBSESSING OVER POLLS. AND, LET ME BEGIN WITH ONE THING I HAVE HEARD YOU EXPLAINED BRILLIANTLY, THAT IS WHAT IS A LIKELY VOTER? WHAT IS A LIKELY VOTER IN POLLS, AND HOW THAT IS BASICALLY SOME FORM OF A GUESS OF WHO THEY LIKELY VOTER IS?  YEAH, IT IS A GAS, AND PARTICULARLY IT WAS HARD IN THIS ELECTION BECAUSE IN THE LAST TWO ELECTIONS THE ELECTORATE GREW SO MUCH. AND WE HAD ALL THESE NEW VOTERS IN THE ELECTORATE, IT WAS GOING TO BE VERY HARD TO KNOW WHO WAS GOING TO VOTE, AND SO I DO THINK THIS QUESTION ABOUT LIKELY VOTER WAS ALWAYS HARD, BUT IT WAS MUCH HARDER IN THE SELECTION. IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE POLLS WERE REALLY ALL OVER THE PLACE OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS.  AND I WANT TO GO TO SOMETHING YOU SAID ABOUT WHAT WE SAW IN MICHIGAN, WHICH WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING, THIS WIN OF BOTH CHAMBERS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE, THE GOVERNOR, YOU SAID THAT THE DUST CLEARS, THAT MIGHT BE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT HAPPENED.  YEAH, I THINK IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT, THING IT MAYBE THE MOST IMPORTANT STORY OF THE ELECTION, BECAUSE IT SHOWS THE POWER AND POTENCY OF THE ABORTION ISSUE. IT SHOULD REALLY WORRY THE -- SO IMPORTANT TO SO MANY PEOPLE, THEY ARE SO DEEPLY OUT OF POSITION, AND IT IS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY GET BACK INTO POSITION ON THIS ISSUE. THEIR BASE IS NOT GOING TO LET THEM CUT A DEAL WITH DEMOCRATS, NOT LET THEM MODERATE IN ANY WAY ON THIS ISSUE. THEY MADE A HISTORIC, ERROR AND TO ME IT COULD BE AN ERROR AS BIG AS WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE REPUBLICANS IN THE GREAT DEPRESSION WHERE AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF PEOPLE JUST LOOK AT THAT PARTY, AS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT REALLY AVAILABLE TO THEM. SO I THINK IT IS A DEEPLY CONSEQUENTIAL THING, IT IS NOT JUST GOING TO DRIVE THIS ELECTION, IT COULD DRIVE THE NEXT FEW ELECTIONS, AND IT IS WHY I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT DEMOCRATIC CHANCES IN THE COMING YEARS.  YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU ARE IN THE CLINTON WAR ROOM AND I WAS HANGING AROUND, MY VERY FIRST PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, I WAS WORKING IN THE SENATE, JASON TO IT. I REMEMBER BEING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, FOR THE PRIMARY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE, AND EVERY TIME YOU WALK INTO ONE OF THE PLACES WHERE ALL THE PRESSES HANGING OUT, AND EVERYONE ASKED EVERYONE ELSE THE SAME QUESTION, WHAT DO YOU KNOW? THEY JUST DON'T KNOW -- WHAT DO YOU KNOW. AND TO BE SMART IN THAT CONVERSATION, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, WHICH HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH WHAT WE WERE JUST SEEING ON VIDEO THERE WITH PEOPLE PRETENDING THEY KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.  YEAH, LISTEN, THE BIG MISS THE CYCLE WAS ON DEMOCRATIC INTENSITY. THE POLLS WERE NOT WRONG, THE ANALYSIS WAS WRONG. THE ANALYSIS OF THE POLLS AND THE DATA WAS WRONG. AND LET ME EXPLAIN REALLY QUICKLY, WHY RIGHT, IN JUNE THE ELECTION CHANGED, A COMBINATION OF UVALDE, JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE HEARINGS, ENDING OF ROE, ABORTION, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WHAT WE WERE SEEING RIGHT IN THESE FIVE HOW SPECIALS THAT TOOK PLACE WERE CONSISTENT DEMOCRATIC OVER PERFORMANCE, AND REPUBLICAN STRUGGLING. YOU SAW IT AGAIN IN KANSAS, YOU SAW DEMOCRATS OVER PERFORMING, REPUBLICAN STRUGGLING, IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE A RED WAVE. THEN YOU SAW DEMOCRATS RAISING MUCH MORE MONEY INTO THEIR CAMPAIGNS, THEN REPUBLICANS AND THE OTHER SIDE AND THEN THE VOTER NUMBERS HUAWEI UP FOR US. WE SAW A BIG SURGE OF DEMOCRATS REGISTERING PARTICULARLY, WOMEN YOUNG WOMEN, SO WE WERE CHECKING ALL OF THESE INTENSITY BOXES THERE REPUBLICANS WERE CHECKING NONE OF THEM. SO THE QUESTION, WAS WOULD THAT SAME DYNAMIC SHOW UP IN ELECTION DAY. THEN THE EARLY VOTE CAME, AND WE SAW THAT SAME DYNAMIC PLAY OUT OVER THE TWO WEEKS, THE EARLY VOTE, AND SO WHAT WE POSTED WAS WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE AND AS YOU PUT OUT IN THE TWEET EARLIER, THE PULLING IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS ALSO IF YOU STEP OUT THE PARTISAN POLL, 'S WERE PRETTY GOOD FOR DEMOCRATS INCLUDING YOUR FINAL NBC POLL WHICH MAYBE THE SINGLE BEST PULL OF THE WHOLE CYCLE BY THE WAY, THE NBC POLL THAT CAME OUT THE SUNDAY BEFORE THE ELECTION. WHAT WE WERE LOOKING AT WAS HIGH DEMOCRATIC INTENSITY FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS, DEMOCRATIC OVER PERFORMANCE, PLUS COMPETITIVE ELECTION END|20221115035955|2022-11-15_0300_US_MSNBC_The_Last_Word_With_Lawrence_ODonnell ",

AND WITH THAT VICTORY DEMOCRATS MANAGED TO STAY IN CONTROL THE SENATE. THEY COULD EVEN EXPAND THE MAJORITY IN THAT GEORGIA RUNOFF, WHICH IS 22 DAYS FROM. NOW BUT IT WILL NOT BE THE RACE THAT DECIDE CONTROL OF THE SENATE. THEY WILL LIKELY HOLD THE ELECTION AFTER THAT, MAJORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER IS EXPECTED TO KEEP THE TITLE, JOINING RACHEL MADDOW THE NEXT -- I'M ANXIOUS TO SEE WHAT HE HAS TO SAY. IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR IS WHAT HAPPENED ON THE OTHER SIDE. WHETHER HIS COUNTERPART, STILL MIND MINORITY LEADER WILL KEEP HIS POSITION. WE ARE SET TO FIND OUT ONCE A NETS AND THE REPUBLICANS -- SEVERAL SENATORS TED CRUZ ARE CALLING FOR THAT VOTE TO BE DELAYED UNTIL AFTER THE GEORGIA RUNOFF. AS OF, NOW THEY ARE NOT DELAYING IT. ALSO UNCERTAIN, WHAT HAPPENS TO KEVIN MCCARTHY. NOW, HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE MEANT TO HOLD ELECTIONS TOMORROW. THERE ARE REPORTS THAT ARIZONA CONGRESSMAN ANDY BIGGS WHO'S A FAR-RIGHT DIE HARD MAY CHALLENGE MCCARTHY, EVEN THOUGH CONTROL THE HOUSE IS STILL NOT DETERMINED AT THIS MOMENT. ABC NEWS JOINS ME RIGHT NOW. SO, WE ARE VERY USED TO THESE SORTS OF POST ELECTIONS RECRIMINATIONS AMONG DEMOCRATS. WE ARE SEEING A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A REPUBLICAN THAT WE HAVE SEEN EVERY LAST FEW ELECTIONS THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE -- WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SENATE? THAT'S A REAL MOVEMENT TO DELAY THESE LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS WARMER PEOPLE ARE JOINING, AN ALLY OF LEADERSHIP HUGE LETTER SIGNED BY ALL THIS OUTSIDE PEOPLE INCLUDING GINNI THOMAS THEY'RE ALL, SAYING WHAT IS GOING ON THERE?  THAT'S RIGHT CHRIS, IT'S BECAUSE THEY VASTLY UNDERPERFORM EXPECTATIONS IN THE SENATE. THEY WERE WIDELY EXPECTING TO PICK UP THAT MINIMUM, ONCE HE HAS FALLEN SHORT AND THEY MIGHT EVEN END UP DOWN ONE SEAT IF THEY END UP CAPTURING GEORGIA IN THAT RUNOFF. NOW, MUCH MCCONNELL IS FACING THE GREATEST THREAT TO HIS LEADERSHIP OVER HIS 15 YEARS OF RUNNING A REPUBLICAN CAUCUS. I SAY THAT BECAUSE HE HASN'T HAD MUCH OF A THREAT, NOW THERE ARE EIGHT REPUBLICAN SENTENCE ON THE RECORD TRYING TO DELAY THE LEADERSHIP ELECTION. NOW, THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN ACCORDING TO THE LEADERSHIP TEAM. AND A FEW OF US REPORTERS ASKED HIM WHEN HE WAS MAKING HIS WAY TO THE SENATE FORM EARLIER TODAY WHETHER HE HAS THE VOTES TO BE ELECTED LEADER. HE CITY OF COURSE BECAUSE HE SOUNDS VERY CONFIDENT. THAT CONFIDENCE IS WITH SOME MERIT, CHRIS. THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE'S A SECRET BALLOT ELECTION. HE SAID HE NEEDS A MAJORITY OF HIS CAUCUS TO GET REELECTED LEADER. AND HE IS MUCH LOWER THAN A NUMBER THAN WHAT IS CRITICS NEED TO STOP HIM FROM BECOMING A LEADER. PEOPLE LIKE DONALD TRUMP BLAME MITCH MCCONNELL FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY -- OTHERS BLAME DONALD. TRUMP SOMEPLACE RICK SCOTT. I SPOKE TO ONE REPUBLICAN SENATOR FEW HOURS AGO, SENATOR MITT ROMNEY OF UTAH. HE SAID THE BLAME LIES LARGELY WITH DONALD. TRUMP I WANT TO PLAY WHAT ROMNEY HAD TO SAY.  ABORTION PLAYED A MUCH BIGGER ROLE THAN WE AND ANTICIPATED. I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP'S AN ALBATROSS. THE PROSPECTS OF THIS, IT HELPED US ELECTION THE PEOPLE WITH SOME OF THE CANDIDATES. I THINK IT'S EASIER TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT. IT IS LIKE THE AGING PITCHER WHO KEEPS LOSING GAMES. IF WE WANT TO, WHEN WE NEED A BIGGER PICTURE ON THE MOUND. I KNOW THERE ARE SOME FANS THAT LOVE HIM BUT IT'S TIME TO GET OFF THE MOUND. WE HAVE A VERY STRONG BENCH.  RAMY MAY BE WHERE REPUBLICAN SENATOR WILLING TO SAY THAT OUT LOUD. BUT I GUARANTEE MANY ARE IN THE PARTY IN THIS COMPLEX QUIETLY AGREE WITH HIM AND BLAME DONALD TRUMP FOR THE PARTIES LOSSES. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY HE IS STILL THE FAVORITE ON WEDNESDAY TO BE REELECTED LATER.  WE SHOULD SAY THAT CYNTHIA OF WYOMING, ALSO WITH RON DESANTIS. I SAW THAT TODAY, THERE IS A REALLY NASTY PUBLIC SNIPING BETWEEN RICK SCOTT AND MITCH MCCONNELL CAM. I THOUGHT TO BE REALLY STRIKING. THEY'RE GOING AT EACH OTHER IN PUBLIC, THERE IS ALSO A HOUSE MEETING. TODAY THE HOUSE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS HAD A KIND OF LEADERSHIP FORM TODAY. WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THAT?  THAT'S, RIGHT I CANDIDATE FORUM THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR HOURS. IT ONLY RECENTLY SORT OF BREAKING DOWN. THIS IS WHERE CANDIDATES MAKE THEIR PITCH TO THE ROOM FULL OF CAUCUS MEMBERS ABOUT WHY THEY WANT TO BE LEADER, WHY THEY WANT TO BE WITH IT. THE ONE RACE THAT EVERYONE IS WATCHING IS THE RACE FOR WOULD BE SPEAKER IF REPUBLICANS DO END UP CAPTURING CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. I WANT TO BE ABUNDANTLY, CLEAR WE HAVE NOT CALLED THAT YET. BUT OUR PROJECTIONS SUGGEST THAT REPUBLICANS ARE ON TRACK TO WIN A MAJORITY OF 219 TO 216. THAT IS WAY FOR THIN MARGIN THAT REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE IF THE VOTE GOES AS IS CURRENTLY PROJECTED. THAT MEANS KEVIN MCCARTHY NEEDS 218 VOTES ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE TO BECOME SPEAKER. I'M NO MATHEMATICIAN CHRIS, THAT IS ONE FEWER THAN 219. ALMOST HAS NO MARGIN TO SPARE. THIS IS A CLOSED-DOOR MEETING WHERE HE NEEDS A MAJORITY OF HIS CAUCUS TO BE NOMINATED SPEAKER. THE DIFFICULT PART IS GETTING THE ELECTED SPEAKER ON THE FLOOR ON JANUARY 3RD. THIS IS FOR A NUMBER OF MEMBERS COMING OUT OF THE MEETING TOLD REPORTERS TODAY THAT KEVIN MCCARTHY DOES NOT HAVE. IT THEY ARE NOT PREPARED TO SUPPORT HIM. THAT INCLUDES FAR-RIGHT MEMBERS LIKE MATT GATES, THE CHAIR OF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS SCOTT PERRY. THERE ARE OTHERS LIKE BOB GOOD OF VIRGINIA WHO ARE NOT READY TO SUPPORT MCCARTHY. BUT THERE ARE MANY ON KEVIN MCCARTHY SIDE. JIM, JORDAN THE RIGHT-WING REPUBLICAN WHO HAD BEEN LYING TO CHAIR THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. EVEN MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE SEARCHES BEHIND KEVIN MCCARTHY. SHE FEARS THAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO PEEL OFF SOME DEMOCRATIC SPEAKERS. THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN CHRIS BUT IT POINTS TO THE ENDGAME HERE THAT THEY WILL COME UP WITH A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE OR JUST COMES UP TO A SECOND, THIRD BALLOT AND KEVIN MCCARTHY WOULD ULTIMATELY BE THE FAVORITE IN THAT SITUATION.  IT'S VERY CLEAR SHE IS LOOKING FOR CONCESSIONS. ALSO REPORTING THAT TRUMP IS SUPPORTING MCCARTHY BEHIND THE SCENES. ALL OF THAT IS ABOUT LEVERAGE, RIGHT? FOLKS LIKE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE AND WHAT TRUMP WANT IS TO HAVE A SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE THAT EFFECTIVELY THEY CAN CONTROL, RIGHT? WHAT WAS THEM AND WHO IS IN DEBT TO THEM.  MCCARTHY HAS ANTICIPATED THIS MOMENT FOR A LONG TIME. THAT'S WHY HE'S FOUGHT TO STAND ON TRUMP'S GOOD GRACES EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. HE KNEW TRUMP COULD MAKE OR BREAK HIS POTENTIAL SPEAKERSHIP. YOU GET REPUBLICANS TO TAKE CONTROL THE HOUSE BECAUSE HE WOULD NEED WE DON'T KNOW THE CONCESSIONS THAT THEY ARE DEMANDING, BUT THE FREEDOM CAUCUS WOULD NEED COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS. THEY WOULD NEED -- LEGISLATION NEEDS X HOURS BEFORE EVOKE. THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY PUBLIC ABOUT. THAT BUT THIS GROUP, THIS FACTION IF HOUSE REPUBLICANS DOES HAVE LEVERAGE AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP ON THE FLOOR OF THE HOUSE. THIS IS SOMETHING KEVIN MCCARTHY WOULD LIKE TO AVOID EARLY NEXT YEAR. THAT'S IF HE DOES GET THE MAJORITY.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH, COMING UP WE ARE STILL WAITING ON A POINT.

FINCHEM WAS SEEN OUTSIDE THE U.S. CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6th AND MADE ELECTION DENIALISM THE CENTERPIECE OF HIS CANDIDACY TO BE SECRETARY OF STATE.

THEIR PLATFORMS WERE ROOTED IN TRUMP'S DISPROVEN CLAIMS THAT THE 2020 RACE WAS RIGGED, AND THEIR BIDS FOR PUBLIC OFFICE RAISED GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THE POPULAR WILL COULD BE SUBVERTED AND FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS BE UNDERMIND IN 2024 AND BEYOND. INSTALLING LOYALISTS AS SECRETARY OF STATE IN BATTLEGROUND STATES, THAT WAS THE PLAN. THAT WAS ALL PART OF DONALD TRUMP'S PLAN TO RESHAPE OUR COUNTRY'S ELECTION SYSTEM IN HIS FAVOR SO HE CAN MORE EASILY STEAL THE NEXT ELECTION. TRUMP REPORTS THIS. \"SUDDENLY SECRETARY OF STATE RACES BECAME PREMIER ATTRACTIONS, ELEVATING ONCE SLEEPY BUREAUCRATIC DOWN BALLOT RACES TO THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT. DONATIONS, ESPECIALLY FROM ALARMED DEMOCRATS, QUICKLY FLOODED THE RACES. NEARLY $50 MILLION WAS SPENT ON TELEVISION ADVERTISING IN FOUR STATES -- MICHIGAN, ARIZONA, NEVADA, AND MINNESOTA. AND DEMOCRATS HAD A 10-1 SPENDING ADVANTAGE.\" NEVADA'S SECRETARY OF STATE-ELECT CISCO AGUILAR SPOKE THIS MORNING ABOUT HOW HIS CONSTITUENTS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT REPUBLICANS WERE SAYING.  WE SPENT A SIGNIFICANT TIME MEETING WITH VOTERS IN THE RURAL COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE, YOU KNOW, A STRONG VOICE ABOUT WHAT OUR STATE SHOULD BE AND WHERE WE SHOULD GO IN THE FUTURE. THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO UNILATERALLY WALK INTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE AND DO SOMETHING TO TAKE AWAY THE VOICE OF MANY NEVADANS. AND WHEN YOU TRY TO SILENCE A COMMUNITY, THAT'S WHEN WE'RE GOING TO STAND UP AND FIGHT BACK EVEN HARDER.\"  THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, VOTERS. A BROAD REJECTION OF ELECTION DENIERS FOR THE POSITION THAT OVERSEES OUR ELECTIONS IS WHERE WE BEGIN THE HOUR WITH SOME OF OUR FAVORITE REPORTERS AND FRIENDS. \"NEW YORK TIMES\" DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT NICK COURSEENITI IS HERE. HIS BYLINE IS ON THAT \"TIMES\" REPORTING WE READ FROM. ALSO BASIL SCHMEICHEL, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND THE DIRECTOR OF POLICY PROGRAM AT HUNTER COLLEGE. AND MICHIGAN'S DEMOCRATIC SECRETARY OF STATE, WHO WE HAVE NEVER DESCRIBED AS BUREAUCRATIC OR SLEEPY. JOCELYN BENSON IS BACK. SO WE HAVE BEEN TALKING TO YOU SINCE THE EMBERS OF THE 2020 ELECTION WERE STILL VERY MUCH BURNING HOT ON THE RIGHT. AND I FIRST WANT TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON YOUR WIN. MICHIGAN'S A VERY TOUGH STATE. TELL ME HOW YOU'RE FEELING. I GUESS NOT QUITE ONE WEEK IN.  I'M EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO THE VOTERS WHO RECOGNIZED WHAT WAS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION AND REACTED ACCORDINGLY. WE SAW THE HIGHEST TURNOUT ELECTION IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY, PEOPLE VOTING FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS, ALL WALKS OF LIFE, TO DEFEND DEMOCRACY ALONGSIDE US -- ALONGSIDE OF US. AND IT PUTS US IN A STRONG POSITION GOING INTO THE NEXT CYCLE. BUT CERTAINLY REALLY SHOWS THROUGH THE VOTERS' VOICES THAT DISMANTLING DEMOCRACY IS A LOSING POLITICAL STRATEGY.  WHICH WE DIDN'T KNOW -- I FEEL LIKE YOU AND I THOUGHT THAT COULD BE AND SHOULD BE BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WOULD BE. HOW DO YOU FEEL THAT THE VOTERS OF MICHIGAN AND FRANKLY EVERYWHERE THAT SORT OF HAD THIS CONVERSATION AS PART OF THE GENERAL ELECTION CONVERSATION, AND I CAN'T THINK OF ANYWHERE IT DID NOT, VOTERS SEE IT AS THE WAY YOU JUST DESCRIBED IT.  YEAH, AND THEY SAW EVERYTHING WAS CONNECTED. TRYING TO MAKE THIS ABOUT QUOTE UNQUOTE THE ECONOMY WAS ALSO ROOTED IN OUR ABILITY TO VOTE AND OUR ABILITY TO HOLD ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE AND BE A PART OF ECONOMIC DECISIONS THAT AFFECT ALL OF US. VOTERS WERE ABLE TO CONNECT THE DOTS AND UNDERSTAND THAT WITH THEIR VOTE THEY WOULD BE IMPACTING THE FUTURE OF THEIR VOICES AND THEIR VOTES ON A VAST ARRAY OF ISSUES FROM REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE TO ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. SO THAT WAS REALLY GRATIFYING. IT SHOWS THAT VOTERS ARE PAYING ATTENTION. AND IN MICHIGAN WE ALSO HAD A BALLOT INITIATIVE WHERE VOTERS BY CASTING THEIR VOTE COULD EXPAND AND PROTECT THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION, WHICH WAS ANOTHER WAY WHERE THEY HAD AGENCY OVER THEIR VOTE. THEY WEREN'T JUST VOTING FOR PEOPLE. THEY WERE VOTING FOR ISSUES AND MAKING A DIRECT IMPACT ON THEIR FUTURE. AND THEY REACTED ACCORDINGLY.  I DON'T WANT TO EMBARRASS YOU BUT I'M GOING TO PUT THIS UP. YOU WON 55.8% OF THE VOTE AGAINST KRISTEN KARAMO. IN THREE OF THE FOUR STATES WHERE ELECTION DENIERS WERE DEFEATED, I BELIEVE IT'S THE SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDATES THAT HAD THE HIGHEST VOTE COUNT. DO I HAVE THAT RIGHT? YEAH, THE DEMOCRATIC SECRETARY OF STATE NOMINEE WAS THE STATE'S LEADING VOTE GETTER. THESE ARE THE OTHERS THAT OUSTED -- OR DEFEATED OR VOTED AGAINST BIG LIE ADVOCATES. MICHIGAN, MINNESOTA, ARIZONA AND NEVADA. WHAT WAS THE -- WHAT IN YOUR VIEW WAS -- I MEAN, YOU TALKED ABOUT VOTERS CONNECTING THE DOTS. I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THAT. THAT IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PROTECT AND HONOR THE PERSON YOU VOTED FOR WHY DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING TO FIX YOUR ECONOMIC PAIN AND ANXIETY, WHICH IS VERY REAL, THAT THEY'RE NOT THE ONES TO FIX IT? GOVERNOR WHITNER TIED ALL THAT TOGETHER. SHE ALSO TIED TOGETHER TAKING AWAY THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION THAT WE'VE ENJOYED FOR 50 YEARS. WHEN YOU LOOK -- WHEN YOU JUST PEEL OUT THE SECRETARY OF STATE RACES, THOUGH, AND SEE THAT THE VOTE COUNT IS EVEN HIGHER THAN SOME OF THE VERY HIGH VOTE GETTERS LIKE YOUR GOVERNOR, GOVERNOR WHITMER, WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WAS ABOUT TOUCHING THIS ONCE SACRED, NOT POLITICAL POST OF SECRETARY OF STATE?  WELL, AS MY NEW COLLEAGUE CISCO AGUILAR SAID EARLIER THAT YOU QUOTED, WHEN PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEIR VOICES ARE GOING TO BE TAKEN AWAY THEY WILL STAND UP AND FIGHT. AND THAT IS WHAT WE'D ALWAYS HOPED. THAT'S WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT FOR THE LAST TWO, MAYBE EVEN THREE YEARS. BUT WHAT VOTERS RESPONDED WITH ACCORDINGLY WAS SHOWING A TREMENDOUS DEMONSTRATION OF STRENGTH. AND STRENGTH AND BELIEF IN AMERICANS' DEMOCRACY AND OUR RIGHTS TO HOLD OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE AND REALLY REJECT THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN LYING AND SPREADING THIS MISINFORMATION, KNOWINGLY TO SUPPORT THEIR OWN POLITICAL AGENDA. VOTERS SAID NO, WE'RE NOT HAVING IT. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COME FOR US. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COME FOR OUR REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMS. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COME FOR OUR DEMOCRACY. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT IT. AND I'VE SAID FOR A LONG TIME MY HOPE IN THIS MOMENT IS THAT WE EMERGE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WITH A HEALTHIER AND STRONGER, MORE ROBUST DEMOCRACY THAN EVER BEFORE, THAN WE HAD BACK IN 2016 AND 2014. AND THAT TRULY IS THE DIRECTION WE'RE HEADED IN WITH THIS ELECTION. THAT WE'VE GOT A CHANCE TO ENSURE CONTINUALLY THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THE POWER OF THEIR VOICES, THE POWER OF THEIR VOTES, WHICH IS THE BEST ANTIDOTE TO REALLY THE STRATEGY ON THE OTHER SIDE TO DIMINISH DEMOCRACY AND MAKE PEOPLE FEEL THEIR VOICES DON'T MATTER. HERE IN THIS ELECTION VOTERS SAID NO, OUR VOICES DO MATTER AND LET US SHOW YOU HOW.  NICK, YOUR STORY, I THINK IT BROKE -- OR WAS ALERTED ON MY PHONE SATURDAY NIGHT, AND I WAS IN THE STREET, AND I STOPPED AND I READ THE WHOLE THING. I WANT TO READ SOME MORE FROM WHAT YOU WROTE. JIM MARCHANT, THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IN NEVADA, HAD HELPED ORGANIZE A NATIONAL RIGHT-WING SLATE OF CANDIDATES UNDER THE NAME AMERICA FIRST. WITH MARCHANT'S LOSS TO MR. AGUILAR ALL BUT ONE OF THOSE AMERICA FIRST CANDIDATES WERE DEFEATED. ONLY DIEGO MORALES, A REPUBLICAN IN DEEP RED INDIANA, WAS SUCCESSFUL, WHILE CANDIDATES IN MICHIGAN, ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO WERE DEFEATED. MR. MARCHANT NOT ONLY REPEATEDLY CLAIMED THAT TRUMP HAD WON THE 2020 ELECTION BUT HE PLEDGED THAT IF HE WERE ELECTED TRUMP WOULD AGAIN BE PRESIDENT IN 2024. YOU HAVE BEEN ON THIS BEAT SINCE THE -- I TALKED ABOUT THE EMBERS. THEY WERE STILL FLAMES OF THE 2020 ELECTION. AND I JUST WANT YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT SORT OF TWO-YEAR STRETCH OF ECHOING THESE CLAIMS FROM A DEFEATED PRESIDENT WHO HADN'T YET LEFT OFFICE THROUGH THE DEADLY INSURRECTION AND THEN CARRYING THESE MESSAGES OF DECERTIFYING THE 2020 ELECTION THROUGH THEIR PRIME GENERAL ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND THEN LOSING.  YEAH. I THINK WHAT WE SAW AS SECRETARY BENSON MENTIONED WAS THAT VOTERS REALLY REJECTED THE IDEA OF A BACKWARD-LOOKING, WE'RE STILL OBSESSED WITH YOU KNOW, THE 2020 CAMPAIGN, THAT'S NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE ISSUES AT THE FOREFRONT OF AMERICAN POLITICS RIGHT NOW. BUT WHEN YOU GO BACK AND YOU LOOK AT THIS EFFORT, AND TO ORGANIZE THIS SLATE OF AMERICA FIRST SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDATES, STARTED BY JIM MARCHANT, WHO IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE \"TIMES\" SAID THAT HE WAS APPROACHED BY ALLIES OF FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP TO RUN FOR SECRETARY OF STATE AND TO KIND OF RECRUIT THIS GROUP AND THAT BY DOING THAT AND TAKING OVER THESE POSITIONS, YOU KNOW, THEY COULD ENSURE, QUOTE UNQUOTE, ELECTION INTEGRITY, WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS A KIND OF CODE WORD AMONG THESE PEOPLE FOR A DIFFERENT TYPE OF OVERSIGHT OF AMERICAN ELECTIONS. SO WHEN THAT STARTED, I WAS EVEN WONDERING IF VOTERS WOULD KNOW WHAT A SECRETARY OF STATE DOES. YOU KNOW, THERE WERE SO MANY TIMES I'D BE OUT ON THE TRAIL OR I EVEN WAS OUT DURING THE GEORGIA PRIMARIES WITH JODI HEISS, WHO WAS ANOTHER ONE OF THESE AMERICA FIRST SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDATES WHO LOST TO BRAD RAFFENSPERGER IN THE PRIMARY. NO ONE WAS CERTAIN WHAT THIS WAS ALL ABOUT. BUT I THINK WHEN YOU SAW NEARLY $50 MILLION OF TELEVISION ADVERTISEMENTS ABOUT SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDATES, YOU KNOW, FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP RETURNING TO THE TRAIL, KEEPING FALSEHOODS AND LIES ABOUT THE 2020 ELECTION ALIVE, IT KIND OF BROUGHT THIS ISSUE BACK TO THE FOREFRONT. AND EVEN AMID AN ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND ISSUES LIKE ABORTION TAKING A HOLD ON VOTERS' MINDS, THEY REALLY REJECTED THAT IDEA THAT ANYTHING WOULD MESS WITH THEIR VOTE. AND REMEMBER, WHILE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN KIND OF TOLD NOT TO VOTE BY MAIL BY SOME OF THE MORE RIGHT-WING CANDIDATES, IT'S NOT A ZERO SUM GAME. THERE'S STILL PLENTY THAT VOTE BY MAIL OR ENJOY SOME OF THE DIFFERENT VOTING OPTIONS. SO IF SOME OF THEM ARE TOLD YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ALLOWED TO VOTE OR EVEN THE MORE OUTLANDISH PLANS LIKE TAKING AWAY ELECTION MACHINES WERE TO BE PUT INTO PLACE, VOTERS JUST CLEARLY REJECTED THAT AS ONE STEP TOO FAR. AND I THINK A TWO-YEAR RECORD OF DOING THAT IS PRETTY CLEAR TO TELL THE VOTERS BY ELECTION DAY.  LET ME -- NICK MENTIONED THE ADS. BASIL, LET ME SHOW YOU ONE OF THE ADS THAT AMY McGRATH'S GROUP -- AND SHE WAS HERE WHEN SHE LAUNCHED THAT GROUP. THIS IS ONE OF THE ADS THAT HER GROUP HAD RUNNING ON TV.  HERE IN WASHINGTON THEY DON'T BUILD MONUMENTS TO SECRETARIES OF STATE, BUT MAYBE THEY SHOULD. DONALD TRUMP THINKS THIS IS THE WEAKEST LINK IN THE CHAIN BECAUSE IT'S AN OFFICE NO ONE PAYS ATTENTION TO. SO HE'S BEEN RECRUITING ELECTION DENIERS TO RUN FOR SECRETARY OF STATE IN CRUCIAL SWING STATES THIS YEAR. PEOPLE WHO WILL DO WHATEVER HE ASKS WHEN THEY COUNT THE BALLOTS IN THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. WE HAVE TO STOP THIS FROM HAPPENING.  SO BASIL, REPUBLICANS MADE A REALLY CYNICAL BET, THAT THAT, WHAT SHE JUST SAID, WAS TOO HARD TO FOLLOW. I MEAN, WHENEVER YOU TREAT VOTERS LIKE THEY'RE TOO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE JUST ARTICULATED, TRUMP IS RECRUITING ELECTION DENIERS TO RIG THE VOTE SO THAT HE CAN HAVE A SUCCESSFUL COUP NEXT TIME, IT TURNS OUT VOTERS UNDERSTOOD THAT LOUD AND CLEAR. AND TO THE EARLIER POINT, I MEAN, DEMOCRATIC SECRETARIES OF STATE IN THREE OF THESE FOUR BATTLEGROUNDS WERE THE HIGHEST VOTE GETTER IN THREE OF THOSE STATES.  RIGHT. IT'S BEEN A HUGE CIVICS LESSON FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND REALLY JUST THE SORT OF -- ENCAPSULATE THE THEME OF THIS CONVERSATION. THE MESSAGE, THE TAKEAWAY REALLY HERE IS VOTER INFORMATION AND VOTER AGENCY. CAN WE GIVE THE VOTERS ENOUGH INFORMATION TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHO'S ON THE BALLOT, WHO THEY SHOULD VOTE FOR AND WHY? AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS SEGMENT SAYING THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS CREATING THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT HE COULD BE RETURNED TO THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE SHOULDERS OF HIS SUPPORTERS. AND VOTERS WERE AWARE OF THAT, WERE AWAKE TO THAT, AND ACTED ACCORDINGLY. IN THE SHORT TERM WE -- I THINK A GOOD THING WAS DONE. BUT I HAVE TO SAY THAT WE'RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS IN THE LONG TERM BECAUSE IN THE STATES WHERE SECRETARIES OF STATE ARE NOT ELECTED THEY ARE APPOINTED BY GOVERNORS. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE WHO THE GOVERNOR IS AND WHY YOU'RE VOTING FOR THAT PERSON AND WHAT CHOICES THAT CANDIDATE MAY MAKE FOR WHO THEY PUT INTO THE OFFICE. SECRETARIES OF STATE MIGHT ALSO OVERSEE THINGS LIKE INCORPORATION OF BUSINESSES OR NON-PROFITS. THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE WORK THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL TISH JAMES IS DOING IN NEW YORK WITH THE TRUMP ORGANIZATIONS THERE IS -- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SORT OF WHO IS OVERSEEING ALL OF THOSE PROCESSES AND WHO GETS THOSE INCORPORATION DOCUMENTS AND HOW THEY ARE -- HOW THEY ARE MANAGED GOING FORWARD. THESE ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT JOBS THAT YES, THEY ALWAYS GO UNDER THE RADAR. WITH RESPECT TO BOARDS OF ELECTIONS SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS IN TERMS OF WHO'S AT THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, THOSE ARE OFTENTIMES MADE IN A PARTISAN FASHION, SOME DEMOCRAT, SOME REPUBLICAN. SO WHO ARE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GETTING THOSE JOBS AND APPOINTING THOSE PEOPLE TO POSITIONS? WHAT I'M ALSO ENCOURAGED BY ON THE OTHER HAND IS THAT IN THE MORE -- WITH THESE ELECTIONS THERE ARE MORE AND MORE FOLKS OF COLOR GETTING POSITIONS IN THE HIERARCHY OF STATE LEGISLATURES. SO THEY CAN AT LEAST CREATE LEGISLATION TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE VOTER. WE SEE THAT IN PENNSYLVANIA. I THINK MICHIGAN, JOCELYN, ALSO. IN MINNESOTA WE HAVE FOLKS OF COLOR IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS. ALL OF THESE SEATS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STILL HAVE A FUNCTIONING, EFFECTIVE DEMOCRACY.  NICK, I WANT TO COME BACK TO YOU REAL QUICK ON JUST THE BLAST RADIUS. I FEEL LIKE YOUR BODY OF REPORTING COULD BE DESCRIBED THAT WAY. THERE'S A BIG LIE AND THEN THERE'S THE BLAST RADIUS OF EVERYTHING THAT IT DID. IT'S THE -- I DON'T KNOW. ALMOST 500 VOTER SUPPRESSION LAWS MASQUERAING AS INTEGRITY LAWS BEING PUSHED THROUGH 48 STATES. THE ELECTION DENIERS CHAMPIONED BY DONALD TRUMP FOR SECRETARY OF STATE. THERE WERE THE MORE OBVIOUS THINGS, ELECTION DENIERS CHAMPION FOR GOVERNORS OF ARIZONA AND WHATNOT. BUT WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT ALMOST A WEEK OUT FROM ELECTION DAY OF SORT OF THE PICTURE OF THE BLAST RADIUS FROM THE BIG LIE RIGHT NOW?  WELL, I THINK ONE THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE IS WHAT'S HAPPENED IN STATE LEGISLATURES AS WELL. THERE HAVE BEEN DEMOCRATIC VICTORIES IN STATE LEGISLATURES, ESPECIALLY IN BATTLEGROUND STATES LIKE SECRETARY BENSON'S. HADN'T HAD FULL DEMOCRATIC CONTROL IN 40 YEARS. AND DEMOCRATS WERE ABLE TO FLIP BOTH CHAMBERS. NOW, THAT MEANS THAT NEW VOTING LAWS COULD BE PASSED IN A STATE LIKE MICHIGAN TO EITHER EXPAND ACCESS -- GRANTED, THAT WAS DONE THROUGH A BALLOT PROPOSAL. BUT ALSO EVEN MAYBE JUST ALLOW ELECTION OFFICIALS TO COUNT BALLOTS A FEW DAYS EARLIER SO MAYBE WE'D HAVE RESULTS EVEN SOONER AND MAKE THEIR LIVES A LITTLE EASIER. IN OTHER STATES WE SAW EITHER REPUBLICAN ADVANTAGES EITHER NARROW LIKE KIND OF IN ARIZONA OR IN PENNSYLVANIA, WHICH COULD ALSO PREVENT SOME OF THE MORE OUTRAGEOUS I THINK VOTING PROPOSALS TO COME DOWN. YOU MIGHT SEE A FEW MORE MODERATE REPUBLICANS SAY NO, I CAN'T GET ON BOARD WITH POTENTIALLY PASSING A LAW THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO APOIND OUR OWN SLATE OF ELECTORS. SO I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE STATE LEGISLATIVE MAP THAT HAS REALLY KIND OF CHANGED A LOT IN TERMS OF HOW 2024 MIGHT LOOK.  AND THAT WAS A MESSAGE THAT WAS DELIVERED FROM THE CURRENT PRESIDENT, FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA DELIVERED THAT MESSAGE ON THE STUMP. AND YOU REALLY HEARD DEMOCRATS AFTER 2020 URGING THEIR VOTERS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE RACES. SO INTERESTING. WE'VE BENEFITED FROM HAVING ALL THREE OF YOU AT THE TABLE AND PART OF THIS CONVERSATION. REGULARLY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS AND BEYOND. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELPING US SIFT THROUGH IT TODAY. NICK CORASANITI, BASIL SMIKLE, AND MITCH SECRETARY OF STATE JOCELYN BENSON. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STARTING US OFF TODAY. WHEN WE COME BACK THE VERY LATEST ON THE GUBERNATORIAL RACE IN ARIZONA WHERE KATIE HOBBS IS MAINTAINING A LEAD OVER ELECTION DENIER KARI LAKE, WHOSE PATH TO VICTORY IS GETTING TEENIER BY THE DAY. PLUS AS REPUBLICANS GRAPPLE WITH THEIR FUTURE BRAND NEW REPORTING IN THE \"NEW YORK TIMES\" ABOUT HOW THE TWICE IMPEACHED EX-PRESIDENT WANTED TO SIC THE IRS ON HIS PERCEIVED ENEMIES PEOPLE LIKE FORMER FBI DIRECTOR JAMES COMEY AND HIS DEPUTY ANDREW McCABE. IT'S PART OF A BROADER PATTERN OF DONALD TRUMP USING HIS POWERS OF THE PRESIDENCY FOR PERSONAL GAIN AND TO PUNISH HIS CRITICS. \"DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE\" CONTINUES AFTER A QUICK BREAK. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. 20221114221955.957|20221114222322.696",

OOH.  WHY DID WE WIN? WE HAD GREAT CANDIDATES. THEY HAD FLAWED CANDIDATES. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEGAN TO WORRY THAT THIS MAGA GROUP WAS CONTROLLING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND OUR DEMOCRACY WAS AT RISK. BUT THE OTHER THINGS WE WON IS WE TALKED ABOUT THINGS PEOPLE CARE ABOUT, REDUCING THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, DEALING WITH CLIMATE, STUDENT DEBT. YOUNG PEOPLE VOTE MRD HEAVY THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT BECAUSE OF THOSE ISSUES. SO WE WON, AND I HOPE I CAN CONVINCE MY NON-MAGA REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE DEMOCRATS, THE REASON WE WON IS WE GOT SOMETHING DONE ON ISSUES.  39 PAST THE HOUR. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER CHUCK SCHUMER ON OUR SHOW EARLIER THIS MORNING. ON SATURDAY NIGHT, WE LEARNED HE WILL REMAIN MAJORITY LEADER WHEN THE NEVADA SENATE RACE WAS CALLED FOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO. SHE WAS LONG CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENTS BUT NOW HAS DEFEATED HER REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER, TRUMP-BACKED ADAM LAXALT. JOINING US NOW, CEO OF THE NEVADA INDEPENDENT, JOHN RECALLTON. ALSO WITH US, NATIONAL POLITICAL DIRECTOR FOR INDIVISIBLE PROJECT, MARIA URBINA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING WITH US THIS MORNING.  THANKS THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH. JOHN, I ALWAYS TOLD REPUBLICANS THAT PENNSYLVANIA WAS FOOL'S GOLD, RIGHT? AND IT WAS. I SAY, YOU KNOW, WE ALWAYS GO IN, ALWAYS PULL OUT THE -- I'VE SAID THE SAME THING ABOUT NEVADA, THAT SOMEHOW, SOME WAY, DEMOCRATS ALWAYS PULL OUT VICTORIES IN NEVADA. STARTED SAYING IT WHEN HARRY REED WAS RUNNING. HE'S GOING TO LOSE. NO, HE'S NOT. I'VE NEVER SEEN A STATE AS WIDE AS NEVADA. IT'S SOMETHING YOU UNDERSTAND, WHEN PEOPLE WERE ATTACKING YOU FOR JUST TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT WHERE THIS ELECTION WAS GOING.  YEAH, WELL, YOU HAVE TO PUT UP WITH TROLLS, JOE, AS YOU WELL KNOW. YOU PROBABLY IGNORED THEM THE SAME WAY I DO.  HE TRIES.  IT'S SAD PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT REALITY. YOU JUST SAID THIS IS A CLOSE RACE BUT THERE HAVE BEEN CLOSE RACE BEFORE. BUT THE DEMOCRATIC MACHINE, THE SO-CALLED REED MACHINE IN NEVADA IS UNPARALLELED. JUST BECAUSE THE SENATOR PASSED AWAY LAST YEAR DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE MACHINE SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED. THE PEOPLE PULLING THE LEVERS OF THAT MACHINE ARE STILL AROUND, AND WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO FOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO -- AND BY THE WAY, JOE, ALSO SAVING THREE HOUSE SEATS HERE THAT WERE CONSIDERED TARGETS BY THE REPUBLICANS, AND DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENTS WON ALL OF THOSE, IT IS A REMARKABLE MACHINE AND I WANT'S STILL THERE.  BY THE WAY, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, YOU GOT THE SENATORS RACE CORRECT, BUT WEREN'T YOU SURPRISED THAT ALL THREE DEMOCRATS WON THOSE THREE SEATS IN NEVADA?  I WAS, JOE. I THOUGHT SUZIE LEE IN THE SWING DISTRICT IN NEVADA AND HAD A CREDIBLE CANDIDATE, NOT ONE OF THESE MAGA NUTS OR ELECTION DENIER NUTS RUNNING AGAINST HER, I THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TO LOSE. AND BY THE WAY, I THINK MANY DEMOCRATS THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS GOING TO LOSE. BUT IT PUT HER OVER THE TOP LIKE TITUS AND HORSE BERG. SUZIE LEE HAD A TON OF MEDIA RUN AGAINST HER, REALLY NASTY STUFF. SHE CREATED SOME OF HER OWN PROBLEM, BUT SHE MANAGED TO SURVIVE. BY THE WAY, THE DEMOCRATS ARE ALSO GOING TO MAKE GAINS IN THE LEGISLATURE HERE IN A YEAR IN WHICH A RED WAVE WAS PREDICTED QUITE CONFIDENTLY BY A LOT OF REPUBLICANS.  IT REALLY WAS.  MARIA, YOU'RE LOOKING AT MASTO'S STORY, AND YOU SAY HER STORY IS NEVADA'S STORY. EXPLAIN.  SHE'S THE DAUGHTER OF A LATINO, OF A UNION WORKER. SHE COMES FROM A WORKING-CLASS FAMILY. AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH JOHN. I WAS ON THE 2010 RACE IN NEVADA WORK UNDER THESE MACHINE WOMEN, RIGHT. I WORKED UNDER SHANNON AND OTHERS, AND LIRNED THEN THAT NEVADA IS UNIQUE AND MANY TIMES THE NATIONAL REPORTING IS LOPSIDED. FOLKS UNDERESTIMATED SENATOR CORTEZ MASTO, AND SHE DELIVERED. SHE ALSO DELIVERED THE LATINO VOTE, OUTPERFORMING PRESIDENT BIDEN THERE.  MARIA, YOU'RE PART OF THE REED MACHINE THAT'S STILL WORKING. YOU MENTIONED SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN NEVADA THAT ARE STILL WORKING, REBECCA LAMB, OF COURSE, WHO WAS A LONG-STANDING STAR, BECCA KIRSHNER KATZ, SENIOR ADVISER FOR THE LETTERMAN CAMPAIGN. THE LEGACY IS HAVING A HUGE IMPACT. I KNOW YOUR PROJECT YOU DID A LOT OF WORK CANVASSING, KNOCKING ON DOORS, GETTING YOUNG PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE. WHAT LESSONS DO YOU TAKE AWAY FROM THAT EXPERIENCE TALKING TO YOUNG VOTERS, PARTICULARLY VOTERS OF COLOR?  SURE. I HAD TWO LESSONS LEARNED. ONE, NEVADA, IT'S A PURPLE STATE, A TOUGH STATE, YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BROAD COALITION, AND SENATOR CORTEZ MASTO ASSEMBLED THAT. THE OTHER THING IS THE NONPARTISAN GROUP CONTINUES TO GROW AND BE SIZABLE. NORTHERN NEVADA DID ALL THEIR CANVASSING IN A CRITICAL BATTLEGROUND COUNTY THAT SENATOR CORTEZ MASTO DELIVERED. IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT AS DEMOCRATS COMPETE STATEWIDE THERE THEY CONTINUE TO TALK TO THOSE VOTERS. THE OTHER PIECE I WANT TO ADD MORE BROADLY IS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT GOP EXTREMISM FROM THE BEGINNING IN TERMS OF BEING PART OF A GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY, YOU CAN OFTEN BE ON THE EARLY SIDE OF SETTING TRENDS OR SHIFTING THEM. AND WHEN ROE HAPPENED, I HEARD FROM INDIVISIBLE LEADERS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY TALKING ABOUT THAT THE STAKES WERE HIGHER, THAT WHAT THEY WERE HEARING AT THE DOORS WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THEY WERE HEARING IN THE NEWS, THAT FOLKS WERE SCARED ABOUT DEMOCRACY. WE WENT ON OFFENSE, PULLED OUT -- WE PUT OUT A GUIDE THAT WAS PUSHING PEOPLE TO GO ON OFFENSE AGAINST GOP EXTREMISM. AND IT PROVED TO BE A REALLY HELPFUL STRATEGY THIS CYCLE.  JOHN, SENATOR REED WAS AN UNFLAPPABLE GUY, TOUGH GUY, SKILLED AT DEFINING HIS OPPONENT, A VERY DISCIPLINED GUY. WHAT ELEMENTS OF HARRY REED, THE DISCIPLINE OF THE CAMPAIGN, DEFINING THE OPPONENT, WHAT ELEMENTS IF ANY DID SENATOR CORTEZ MASTO USE AGAINST ADAM LAXALT?  IT'S A GREAT QUESTION, MIKE. YOU CAN SEE THAT SHE WAS INFLUENCED BY HARRY REED, WHO ANOINTED HER TO REPLACE HIM WHEN HE LEFT IN 2016. HER MEDIA AGAINST ADAM LAXALT, DEFINING HIM AS THIS CHILD OF PRIVILEGE WHO DIDN'T GROW UP IN NEVADA, ESSENTIALLY CAME BACK TO NEVADA TO RUN FOR OFFICE AS AN ELECTION DENIER AND AS SOMEONE WHO SAID, AND THEY USED THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN, ROE V. WADE WAS A JOKE, SHE SHOWED ALL THE INSTINCTS OF HER MENTOR. AND ANOTHER ONE SHE SHOWED THAT I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALLY UNDERSTAND IS HER FUND-RAISING ABILITY. HARRY REED WAS ONE OF THE BEST FUND-RAISERS IN THE HISTORY OF THIS STATE. SHE REALLY OUTRAISED LAXALT. OF COURSE THERE WAS A LOT OF OUTSIDE MONEY THAT TENDED TO OVERWHELM THAT, BUT SHE RAISED A TON OF MONEY, AND THAT ALLOWED HER TO KEEP THOSE COMMERCIALS I JUST REFERRED TO ON THE AIR THROUGHOUT THE ELECTION.  ALL RIGHT. CEO OF \"THE NEVADA INDEPENDENT,\" JON RALSTON, AND NATIONAL POLITICAL DIRECTOR OF INDIVISIBLE PROJECT, MARIA URBINA, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR INSIGHT THIS MORNING. > TWO STATES OVER FROM NEVADA IN COLORADO, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR JARED POLIS CRUISED TO RE-ELECTION, DEFEATING HIS REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER 58% TO 39%. GOVERNOR POLIS JOINS US NOW. THIS WAS NOT CLOSE. CONGRATULATIONS, SIR. TO WHAT DO YOU POINT YOUR WIN TO?  REALLY SIMPLE. JUST SOLVING PROBLEMS AND ADDRESSING THE ISSUES BOTH WAYS. I SIGNED OVER 50 WAYS TO SIGN PEOPLE MONEY, THE LARGEST PROPERTY TAX CUT IN THE HISTORY OF COLORADO, TWO INCOME TAX CUTS, FREE PRESCHOOL AND KINDERGARTEN, CAPPED THE OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS OF INSULIN, MANY, MANY MORE. WE REACTED TO MANY PEOPLE'S PAIN POINT. COSTS ARE GOING UP AND WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT AND LET'S GET I DON'T. WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO POINT TO.  GOVERNOR, COLORADO HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A SWING STATE AT TIMES. I KNOW EARLY IN THE CYCLE, ACTUALLY UP TO THE LAST FEW WEEKS, PEOPLE WERE TALKING ABOUT SENATOR BENNETT POSSIBLY HAVING PROBLEMS. NOT ONLY DID THAT NOT HAPPEN, THERE WAS A MASSIVE BLUE WAVE IN COLORADO. I MEAN, REPUBLICANS GOT WIPED OUT. I WOULD SAY YOU LOOK AT COLORADO, YOU LOOK AT MICHIGAN, TWO OF THE BIGGEST STATES FOR DEMOCRATIC WAVES. WHAT HAPPENED IN COLORADO? WHY DID THE COLORADO PEOPLE REJECT REPUBLICANS THE WAY THEY DID THIS YEAR?  SO, TO UNDERSTAND COLORADO, IT STARTS WITH THE FACT THAT OVER 40% OF OUR VOTERS ARE UNAFFILIATED. THEY'RE NEITHER DEMOCRATS MORE REPUBLICANS. DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE ALL MODERATES. SOME LEAN LEFT, SOME RIGHT. BUT WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ARE CANDIDATES, NO MATTER THEIR PARTY IDENTITY, TO SPEAK TO THE ISSUES THAT MATTER AND WILL MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR THEM. WE FOCUSED ON PROTECTING OUR FREEDOM. AS COLORADANS, THAT MEANS THE RIGHT TO MARRY WHO YOU LOVE, TO DECIDE WHEN AND IF TO HAVE KIDS, AND TO SAVE PEOPLE MONEY. THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT RESONATED WITH THAT LARGEST BLOC OF VOTERS, THE UNAFFILIATED VOTER IN OUR STATE.  SO YOU WON IN SOME GOP STRONGHOLDS IN THE STATE. AND I'M WONDERING, WHAT DO YOU THINK BROUGHT REPUBLICANS YOUR WAY? AND WILL YOU TALK ABOUT ADDRESSING PAIN POINTS, THE ECONOMY, INFLATION, THINGS THAT IMPACT KITCHEN-TABLE ISSUES, BUT WHAT ABOUT SOME OF THE BIGGER ISSUES FACING THE COUNTRY -- DEMOCRACY, ELECTIONDENIERS, AND ABORTION?  SO, CERTAINLY THE ABILITY TO HAVE KIDS OR WHEN TO HAVE KIDS, IF TO HAVE KIDS, THAT REALLY GOES INTO THE KIND OF VALUE OF FREEDOM. SO WE CERTAINLY TALKED ABOUT WOMEN SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH DECISIONS. THERE ARE STATES NEXT TO COLORADO, BOARD ERG COLORADO, WHERE WOMEN AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND NURSES ARE LITERALLY FACING JAIL TIME FOR THE DECISIONS THEY'VE MADE. WE'VE MADE CLEAR THAT AS LONG AS DEMOCRATS WERE ELECTED, THAT WOULD NOT HAPPEN IN COLORADO CERTAINLY RESONATED. OBVIOUSLY, THERE IS SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY. WE HAD A NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES THAT WERE ELECTION DENIERS, SOME THAT WEREN'T. THE ONES THAT WEREN'T ELECTION DENIERS FARED BETTER, BUT THEIR BRAND AS REPUBLICANS WAS STILL TAINTED BY THEIR BRETHREN THAT REFUSED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT JOE BIDEN HAD BEEN ELECTED LEGITIMATELY.  THERE WAS THAT. COLORADO GOVERNOR JARED POLIS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING ON THE SHOW THIS MORNING.  CONGRATULATIONS.MUCH.  GOVERNOR, CONGRATULATIONS.  ALWAYS A PLEASURE. THANK YOU. > PRESIDENT BIDEN FRAUDED THE LIBERATION OF KHERSON AS A SIGNIFICANT VICTORY FOR UKRAINE. WHEN \"MORNING JOE\" RETURNS. WHEN \"MORNING JOE\" RETURNS 20221114145043.472|20221114145101.123",

OFFICERS DISCOVERED THE DEATHS WHEN THEY RESPONDED TO A REPORT OF AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON. THE STUDENTS ARE BELIEVED TO BE THE VICTIMS OF HOMICIDE. AUTHORITIES HAVE NOT RELEASED ADDITIONAL DETAILS INCLUDING CAUSES OF DEATH. OF COURSE WE WILL BE FOLLOWING BOTH STORIES. > WE TURN NOW TO THE WAR IN EASTERN EUROPE WHERE THE FIRST MAJOR CITY CAPTURED BY RUSSIA IS NOW BACK UNDER UKRAINIAN CONTROL. RICHARD ENGEL REPORTS FROM THE NEWLY LIBERATED CITY OF KHERSON.  Reporter: KHERSON IS A CITY VICTORIOUS, LIBERATED FROM RUSSIAN OCCUPATION. AND THIS MORNING UKRAINE'S PRESIDENT PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY PAID A VISIT.  HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY?  VERY WELL TODAY. BE CAREFUL.  I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A LOT OF SECURITY HERE. BUT HOW IS THIS MOMENT FOR YOU?  THE MOMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT. THAT IS THE BIGGEST SINCE THE 24th OF FEBRUARY. SO THAT WAS THE BIGGEST CITY AND NOW IT'S FREE. SO UKRAINE CAME SO I AM HAPPY. THANK YOU.  Reporter: THE RUSSIAN OCCUPATION CAME EARLY AND WAS BRUTAL. SO THE JOY AND RELIEF NOW IS PROFOUND. EVERYONE WANTS TO THANK A UKRAINIAN SOLDIER. AND COLLECT AUTOGRAPHS. THERE HAVEN'T BEEN MANY SCENES LIKE THIS IN EUROPE SINCE AMERICAN G.I.s HELPED DEFEAT THE NAZIS IN WORLD WAR II. A UKRAINIAN SOLDIER WAS ONE OF THE FIRST IN RUSHING TO SEE HIS GRANDMOTHER, WHO COLLAPSES TO HER KNEES. WE FOUND THE GRANDMOTHER, LYDIA. SHE HADN'T SEEN THE REUNION VIDEO UNTIL NOW. WHAT WAS THAT MOMENT LIKE? I WAS SO, SO HAPPY TO SEE HIM, SHE SAYS. MY GRANDSON, THAT HE IS RUNNING TO ME, THAT HE IS ALIVE. SHE WATCHES THE VIDEO AGAIN AND AGAIN AND KISSES HIM ON THE SCREEN. AS MONTHS OF FEAR AND UNCERTAINTY WELL UP AND COME POURING OUT. IT WAS OVERDUE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, SHE SAYS. I HAD NO WORDS. KHERSON WAS THE FIRST CITY RUSSIA CAPTURED AFTER IT INVADED. PRESIDENT PUTIN ANNEXED IT ANNEXING IT TO BE FOREVER BONDED TO RUSSIA. IT TURNS OUT FOREVER HAD A TIME LIMIT. NBC'S RICHARD ENGEL WITH THAT REPORT. WE WILL TURN BACK TO THE MIDTERMS IN ANOTHER NOTABLE WAY DEMOCRATS WERE ABLE TO DEFY THE ODDS. THE PARTY GETTING A MAJOR BOOST FROM YOUNG VOTERS AND WON ESPECIALLY BIG WITH YOUNG WOMEN. EXIT POLLS SHOW IN THE CRUCIAL RACE IN PENNSYLVANIA, 77% OF YOUNG WOMEN VOTED FOR DEMOCRAT JOHN FETTERMAN, HELPING PUSH HIM OVER THE FINISH LINE. 72% OF WOMEN AGED 18 TO 29 VOTED FOR DEMOCRATS IN HOUSE RACES NATIONWIDE. JOINING US TO TALK ABOUT THIS IS THE EDITOR OF FORBES WOMEN AND THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE 50 OVER 50 LIST. MAGGIE, LET'S FLY THROUGH THESE. FIRST OF ALL,, THE WOMEN WHO SAVED DEMOCRACY, THEY REALLY GOT OUT THE VOTE.  Reporter: THEY REALLY DID. YOU CAN GO BACK TO 1920 AND LOOK AT THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS. BUT WOMEN ARE AT THE CENTER OF GETTING OUT THE VOTE. WHETHER IT'S THE NEW GEORGIA PROGRESS OR WHEN WE ALL VOTE. WOMEN ARE REGISTERING 500,000 PEOPLE AT A TIME AT EACH ELECTION CYCLE. AND I WOULD ALSO NOTE SINCE 1980 WOMEN VOTERS HAVE OUTPACED MEN VOTERS IN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. SO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS MIDTERM CYCLE ISN'T ENTIRELY NEW. WOMEN ARE SHOWING UP AT THE POLLS AGAIN AND AGAIN AT HIGHER RATES THAN MEN.  ALSO WHEN IT COMES TO FEMALE CANDIDATES, THEY DID QUITE WELL. ESPECIALLY IN RACES THAT REALLY MATTERED AGAINST THE BIG LIE.  Reporter: THEY DID WELL AGAINST THE BIG LIE. AND THIS IS NOT EXCLUSIVELY A FEMALE TEN ON NO, MA'AM NON. IN PENNSYLVANIA, WE OBVIOUSLY HAD A MAN RUNNING AGAINST A MAN. I HEARD JOSE IT EARLIER. PEOPLE ARE SICK OF THE CHAOS. WHEN YOU COMBINE WOMEN'S RIGHTS, THE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ISSUE, ABORTION, WITH THE BIG LIE, I THINK IT MAKES SENSE THAT YOU SEE WOMEN COMING OUT FOR THESE CANDIDATES. THERE WAS A POLL EARLIER THIS YEAR. YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUNGER WOMEN. 61% OF YOUNG WOMEN CONSIDER ABORTION A CRITICAL ISSUE. THAT WAS EARLIER THIS FALL. I THINK THE NUMBERS WE ARE SEEING NOW SUPPORT THAT NUMBER.  THEY REALLY DO. ANOTHER THING YOU'RE LOOKING AT, AND I REALLY WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS, BUT THE AMOUNT OF HARASSMENT THAT FEMALE CANDIDATES ARE DEALING WITH.  Reporter: SO THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE AND PRINCETON UNIVERSITY STUDIED THREATS LEVIED AGAINST WOMEN IN ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. WOMEN RECEIVED THREE TIMES AS MANY THREATS AS MALE POLITICIANS. WOMEN OF COLOR RECEIVE EVEN MORE THAN THAT. THAT'S ONLINE, SOCIAL MEDIA, OVER EMAIL. THIS IS PROLIFERATING PLATFORMS. AND I THINK IT'S A REALLY DANGER TO FEMALE CANDIDATES.  ALL RIGHT. AND ALSO MAGGIE POINTING OUT YOUNGER WOMEN ESPECIALLY BROKE HARD FOR DEMOCRATS THIS ELECTION CYCLE. THIS WAS A HISTORIC MIDTERM IN SO MANY WAYS. THE EDITOR OF FORBES WOMEN, MAGGIE McGRATH, THANK YOU SO MUCH. BEFORE WE GO TODAY, YOUNG WOMEN VOTED.  YEAH.  AND BROKE HARD FOR DEMOCRATS. THIS IS HISTORIC IN SO MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO KNOW IT'S A MIDTERMS. IT MATTERS. I'M THERE.  Reporter: WE'RE GOING TO LOOK BACK FOR DECADES AND DECADES AND DECADES WHAT HAPPENED LAST WEEK. AND ALSO I WOULD WANT TO SAY IN TERMS OF WOMEN SAVING THE PUBLIC, LIZ CHENEY ENDORSING TWO WOMEN, SLOTKIN, SPANBERGER, TWO WOMEN THAT RAN REALLY TOUGH RACES ON WHAT THEY HAD GOTTEN DONE IN A BIPARTISAN WAY AS WELL. IT'S JUST , YOU KNOW, WOMEN SAVING THE REPUBLIC.  Reporter: IT APPEARSOT END|20221114145955|2022-11-14_1400_US_MSNBC_Morning_Joe ",

        "trs": "> NOW WE SEE 2022. HIS CANDIDATES ARE PUTTING THEM IN A POSITION.  YOU SEE WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A RUN AWAY RED YEAR WAVE.  HOUSE WAS, WE HAVE A RED WAVE.  IF WE GET A GOOD SPRINKLER SYSTEM.  RUN THROUGH THE NEW SIGNS. MIGHT NOT SEE A RED WAVE IN NOVEMBER?  THE PROSPECTS OF THIS RED WAVE IN NOVEMBER WHICH SHOULD BE MASSIVE, BUT LOOKING LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE A BIT MORE TEMPERED.  NEW REPORTING ON THE SPECIFIC SIGNS REPUBLICANS HOPE FOR A RED WAVE ARE RECEDING.  IF THESE NUMBERS HOLD OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS, THEN IT'S LESS LIKELY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT MASSIVE RED WAVE.  STILL THE CASE THAT THEY'RE LIKELY TO END UP IN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, BUT THE NOTION OF A RED WAVE, GONE.  THAT'S SOME OF WHAT WE WERE SAYING ON \"MORNING JOE\" RIGHT BEFORE THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS. THERE WAS A LOT, JOE.  YEAH.  A LOT OF NERVES ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND ALSO WHETHER OR NOT THE DEMOCRATIC MESSAGE WAS CLEAR ENOUGH AND WAS HITTING ALL THE NOTES. AT THE SAME TIME, YOU COULD SEE LIKE THE RED WAVE WAS BEING PREDICTED BUT IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT.  THE REASON WE DIDN'T SEE -- THE REASON I DIDN'T SEE IT IS, AGAIN, YOU LOOK TO THE POLLS THAT WERE REALLY GOOD, THE MARQUETTE POLLS. DON'T LISTEN TO RIGHT WING HACKS OR LEFT WING HACKS. THIS TIME IT WAS RIGHT WING HACKS ATTACKING JOHN ROSLSTN. HE WAS RIGHT IN NEVADA AND RIGHT TO THE VERY END. IT'S VERY INTERESTING. THERE'S A HISTORY HERE. WELCOME BACK TO OUR THIRD HOUR. CADDY KAY, MIKE BARNACLE AND REVEREND AL SHARPTON. JEN, I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND HOW UNBELIEVABLY DIFFERENT, HOW HISTORIC WHAT THE DEMOCRATS DID IN THE SENATE IS AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IT'S NOT HAPPENED SINCE 1934 THAT STATE LEGISLATURES FOR THE PARTY IN POWER DIDN'T LOSE THESE STATE LEGISLATURES. BIDEN MAY ACTUALLY PICK UP A GOVERNOR. YOU WORKED WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA WHO IN 2014, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, A GUY WHO HAD JUST WON TWO YEARS BEFORE, HE LOST 9 SENATE SEATS IN 2014 HE LOST 6 SENATE SEATS IN 2010. THIS WAS THE FIRST DEMOCRAT SINCE FDR TO WIN TWO ELECTIONS WITH A MAJORITY OF THE VOTE. THAT'S WHY IT'S SO UNBELIEVABLE WHAT JOE BIDEN HAS DONE ALL ACROSS THE BOARD HERE.  AND IT IS. YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SAYING HOW POLLS WERE SHOWING THAT THE RACES WERE CLOSER THAN THEY REALLY WERE ON BEHALF OF REPUBLICANS. AND IT JUST DIDN'T FEEL THAT WAY. I WAS IN -- I REMEMBER BEING IN PENNSYLVANIA RIGHT AFTER THE FETTERMAN/OZ DEBATE. TALKING TO A COUPLE OF YOUNG GUYS IN THEIR 20s. THEY WERE TRUMP REPORTERS. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE MID-TERMS? DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO WIN BECAUSE OF ABORTION. SOMETIMES IT'S JUST NOT THAT COMPLICATED. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORIC NATURE OF THIS WIN, YEAH, IN 2010 WE LOST 42 SEATS IN THE HOUSE BUT THIS IS JUST LIKE -- IT'S JUST THAT KIND OF -- IT'S JUST THAT KIND OF SMACKDOWN. AND YOU SEE AT EVERY LEVEL THE REPUBLICAN GAINS AREN'T WORKING. BACK TO PENNSYLVANIA. LOOK AT THE SPECIFICITY OF THE IMPACT OF SOME OF THESE POLLS, THESE PUSH POLLS THAT ARE REPUBLICAN BASED. THERE IS ONE THAT CAME OUT THAT WEEK OF THE FETTERMAN/OZ DEBATE. INSIDERS, THEY HAD THE ADVANTAGE. IT SHOWED OZ UP 3 POINTS, RIGHT? THAT WAS MEANT TO HURT FETTERMAN THAT THERE WAS A BAD IMPACT FROM THE DEBATE. NOW WE COME TO FIND OUT THAT PEOPLE REALLY RESPECTED THE FACT THAT FETTERMAN WENT UP AND DEBATED, IT TOOK A LOT OF COURAGE. WHAT OZ SAID ABOUT THE ABORTION -- ABOUT ABORTION AND LOCAL LEADERS PLAYING A ROLE IN THAT REALLY HURT OZ AND THE DEBATE WAS A NET POSITIVE FOR FETTERMAN. SO THERE'S ALL THESE TOOLS THAT REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO USE TO SKEW THESE ELECTIONS AND PEOPLE JUST SAID, NO. LIKE WE GET IT.  YEAH. YOU KNOW, MIKE BARNACLE, YOU LOOK AT ONE POLL AFTER ANOTHER, ONE SCAM POLL AFTER ANOTHER. AGAIN, WE DIDN'T FALL FOR IT BECAUSE WE WERE LOOKING AT GOOD POLLS. I WILL SAY ALSO IT'S AMAZING WHEN YOU EXPAND THE SAMPLE SIZE, THIS PRIVATE POLL THAT SOMEBODY SENT ON TO ME THAT A ENTREPRENEUR HAD SPENT A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE HE WASN'T CONNECTED WITH ANYBODY. HE WANTED TO KNOW HOW THINGS WERE GOING TO BREAK AND THEY NAILED THE RACES. THEY NAILED EVERYTHING. WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THAT TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION I SAID, THERE'S JUST -- THERE'S NO RED WAVE HERE. OF COURSE YOU HEARD IT FROM HEILMAN AND THE REST, THERE WAS NO RED WAVE. THE SCAM POLLS ON THE RIGHT, THE ARROGANCE OF ACTUALLY SOME OF THESE POLL AGGREGATORS AND OTHER PEOPLE ON THE FAR RIGHT GOING -- OR ON THE TRUMP RIGHT GOING, WE'RE GOING TO WIN IN WASHINGTON STATE. THAT RACE IS CLOSE. THE RACE IS CLOSE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. I MEAN, THINK ABOUT THE GARBAGE POLLS THAT ACTUALLY HAD MAGGIE HASSAN LOSING THAT RACE OR HAVING --  RIGHT.  -- THAT RACE TIGHT TO THE VERY END. I JUST HOPE TWO YEARS FROM NOW WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE POLL AGGREGATORS THAT THESE HACKS THAT RUN THESE POLLS FOR PARTIES AND FOR CANDIDATES ISN'T AGGREGATED BECAUSE IT GIVES I THINK THE MEDIA, NOT US, BUT I THINK TOO MANY PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA WRITING ARTICLES ABOUT HOW IT WAS A FAIT ACCOMPLI, THIS RED WAVE. MY GOD, SOME OF THE GARBAGE THAT I HEARD ON PODCASTS THE FINAL WEEK FROM PEOPLE THAT WORK AT RESPECTED PLACES. JUST PURE UNADULTERATED GARBAGE MOCKING DEMOCRATS FOR THEIR DISASTROUS APPROACH WHICH, AGAIN, THEY WERE PREDICTING GOING TO LEAD TO A RED WAVE. I MEAN, IT WAS OBVIOUS TO US THERE WASN'T A RED WAVE.  YOU KNOW, JOE, I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THE WAY WE COVER THINGS. THINGS HAPPEN SO QUICKLY, SO FAST. WE MOVE FROM ONE POLL TO ANOTHER AND WE TRY TO MAKE JUDGMENTS ON THIS POLL AND THEN AN HOUR LATER THERE'S ANOTHER POLL BUT GIVEN THE DISTANCE, ABOUT A WEEK'S DISTANCE BETWEEN TODAY AND THE ELECTIONS LAST TUESDAY, I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER IF WE'VE ALL UNDERESTIMATED THE IMPACT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SPEAKING ABOUT THE DANGERS TO DEMOCRACY. AND PEOPLE SEE THAT SPEECH IN CLIPS. THEY DON'T WANT THE WHOLE SPEECH, BUT THEY SEE IT IN CLIPS FROM THEIR PHONES, SOMETIMES ON THE TVs AT HOME AND HE WAS CALM. HE WAS CONCISE, HE WAS CLEAR. HE WAS NORMAL AND HE WAS SORT OF THE OPPOSITE OF THE CHAOS THAT SURROUNDED SO MUCH OF THIS ELECTION, THIS CRAZY LANGUAGE.  I KNOW.  HEY, MIKE --  YEAH.  YOU USED THE WORD NORMAL. I WANT TO BRING UP SOMETHING THAT YOU TOLD ME YEARS AGO, AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE SUPPOSED TO REVEAL WHO THE AIDE WAS BUT THERE WAS AN AIDE VERY CLOSE TO GEORGE W. BUSH AND, YOU KNOW, YOU WERE JOKING WITH HIM ABOUT HOW BUSH, YOU KNOW, HE GAVE DAVID LETTERMAN ALL THE MATERIAL HE WANTED. AND THIS AIDE SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DOES? AND HE SAID, WE SEE IT IN POLLING. WHEN BUSH STUMBLES AROUND, DOESN'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT WORDS TO SAY, MAYBE HE DOES SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIM LOOK A LITTLE BIT GOOFY, THIS PERSON SAID TO YOU, AND I NEVER FORGOT IT, SAID, YEAH, IT SHOWS AMERICANS HE'S A REAL GUY.  YEAH.  SHOWS THEM THAT HE MAY HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THIS PATRIARCHAL FAMILY, HE MAY HAVE GONE TO YALE, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY HE'S MORE WEST TEXAS THAN NEW HAVEN AND HE SHOWS IT. AND I THINK THAT'S -- YOU SEE THAT IN JOE BIDEN.  ABSOLUTELY.  THE GUY FROM DELAWARE.  ABSOLUTELY. THE OTHER ASPECT OF IT, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS NOW COVERED NO MATTER WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT, WE'LL RAISE IT AGAIN PROBABLY AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE COMING UP WITH PRESIDENT XI, WE'LL REFLECT ON HIS AGE. HE KNOWS --  YES.  -- HOW OLD HE IS. HE KNOWS WHEN HIS BIRTHDAY IS. HE'S GOING TO BE 80 YEARS OF AGE IN ANOTHER WEEK OR SO BUT WE FOCUS ON THE AGE AS APART FROM THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS. IF YOU'RE STANDING IN LINE AT CVS AND YOU'RE GETTING A BREAK ON YOUR PRESCRIPTION COSTS AND YOU'RE 70, 75 AND SAVING SOME BUCKS, THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU, NOT HIS BIRTHDAY.  NOW I TOTALLY AGREE. HE'S JUST -- TIME AND TIME AGAIN UNDER ESTIMATED. IT KEEPS HAPPENING. ANOTHER PERSON WHO FITS THAT DESCRIPTION WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT BUSH, AND HE'S LIKE ME AND I CAN RELATE, IS FETTERMAN.  EXACTLY.  AS OPPOSED TO OZ.  YEAH.  WHO'S LIKE, WHO ARE YOU? WHAT'S YOUR GROCERY STORE?  FETTERMAN AGAIN. WE SHOWED A CLIP. USED HIS STRUGGLE, THE FACT HE HAD GOOD HEALTH CARE. YOU SHOULD HAVE GOOD HEALTH CARE. THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA, HE TURNED THAT DISADVANTAGE INTO AN ADVANTAGE AND I DO WANT TO SAY ONE WORD ABOUT OZ. I WANT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT MASTRIANO. I WANT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE CONCEDED THE RACES.  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU.  YEAH.  THEY CONCEDED THEIR RACES. THEY AREN'T RUNNING AROUND SCREAMING THAT THE RACES WERE STOLEN. YOU FWHEE --  WE'LL TAKE IT.  -- WE'LL TAKE IT AND ALSO I RESPECT PEOPLE THAT GET INVOLVED IN POLITICS ON BOTH SIDES. YOU KNOW, IF YOU WIN, YOU WIN. IF YOU LOSE, YOU LOSE. HERE'S DOUG MASTRIANO. A GUY SWEPT UP ON ELECTION DENYING ON JANUARY 6th. HE ACTUALLY WENT TO THE CAPITOL. SHOWING YOU DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JANUARY 6th, 2021, AND WHERE WE ARE IN NOVEMBER 2022. DOUG MASTRIANO SAID THIS. DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT AS THE RESULTS ARE, THERE IS NO RIGHT COURSE BUT TO CONCEDE. THAT, MY FRIENDS, REVOLUTIONARY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.  ABSOLUTELY.  JUST SIX WEEKS AGO, WHICH I DO. AND I LOOK TO THE CHALLENGES AHEAD. JOSH SHAPIRO WILL BE OUR NEXT GOVERNOR AND I ASK EVERYONE TO GIVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD AND PRAY THAT HE LEADS WELL. LET ME JUST SAY, JIM PALMIERI, A RETURN TO NORMALCY AGAIN AS A FORMER REPUBLICAN, I CAN TELL YOU WHEN I SAW AL GORE CONCEDE AN ELECTION THAT HE LOST BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT WENT RIGHT DOWN POLITICAL LINES 5-4, HE STILL PICKED HIMSELF UP --  VERY BEAUTIFUL.  -- HE BRUSHED HIMSELF OFF HE GAVE WITHOUT A DOUBT HIS MOST IMPORTANT SPEECH AND HIS GREATEST SPEECH THAT NIGHT NOT BECAUSE HE WAS CONCEDING TO A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT BUT BECAUSE HE WAS ACKNOWLEDGING THE BEAUTY OF DEMOCRACY.  IT WAS -- I REMEMBER -- I MEAN, I REMEMBER. I WORKED FOR PRESIDENT CLINTON. IT WAS TOUGH TO WATCH AL GORE DO THAT, BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT IT 20 YEARS ON HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WAS REALLY TOUGH WAS WATCHING MY BOSS HILLARY CLINTON DO THAT ON WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 9th, 2016, STANDING UP, YOU KNOW, AT A HOTEL NOT FAR FROM HERE TO CONCEDE TO TRUMP, TO HAVE CALLED HIM THE NIGHT OF THE ELECTION TO CONGRATULATE HIM AND TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, HOW SHE WAS GOING TO DO WHATEVER SHE COULD TO HELP HIM AND WISH HIM WELL IN LEADING THE COUNTRY. AND THE FACT THAT I WAS STUNNED AND REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THESE NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS, TUDOR DIXON IN MICHIGAN AS WELL, OZ, MASTRIANO CONCEDE, BUT THEY SEE THE WRITING ON THE WALL. PEOPLE ARE NOT WILLING TO TOLERATE THIS IN LIKE VERY BIG NUMBERS PEOPLE SAID THAT ON TUESDAY.  YEAH. SO THIS BRINGS US TO ANOTHER KEY RESULT OF THE ELECTION AS HIGHLIGHTED BY THIS MORNING'S COVER OF THE POST. DENIERS DENIED WITH THE PAPER NOTING THAT ALL THE TRUMP-BACKED CANDIDATES IN KEY STATES WHO DENIED THE 2020 ELECTION RESULTS WHILE VYING TO BE THEIR STATE'S TOP ELECTION OFFICIAL LOST THEIR RACE. JOINING US NOW, NEVADA'S NEWLY ELECTED SECRETARY OF STATE, DEMOCRAT CISCO AGUILAR WHO DEFEATED ONE OF THOSE REPUBLICAN ELECTION DENIERS. ALSO WITH US COLORADO'S DEMOCRATIC SECRETARY OF STATE, JENA GRISWOLD. SHE IS CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC SECRETARIES OF STATE.  JENA, I WOULD GUESS WHEN YOU GOT THAT POSITION, THIS IS A GOOD POSITION TO HAVE.  LIKE IT.  IMPORTANT POSITION TO HAVE.  YEAH.  I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS.  PART OF EVERYTHING.  I BET YOU NEVER THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULD FIND YOURSELF IN THIS POSITION WHERE ACTUALLY IT WAS THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S RACES THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT AS MUCH AS THE GOVERNOR'S RACE.  SO PIVOTAL.  TO FIGURE OUT THE FUTURE HEALTH OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. REMARKABLE, AND THAT NEW YORK POST HEADLINE, DENIERS DENIED. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU AS AN AMERICAN AND AS SOMEONE WHO'S DEDICATED YOUR LIFE TO MAKING SURE THAT CITIZENS' VOTES ARE COUNTED FAIRLY AND ACCURATELY?  WELL, FIRST OFF, GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US BOTH ON. YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY, JOE, I WAS ELECTED TO THIS POSITION BY MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS ON THE HEELS OF THE INSURRECTION. SO RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING WE KNEW THAT SAFEGUARDING AMERICANS ELECTIONS WOULD BE KEY TO THIS ELECTION CYCLE. BUT TO SEE THE RISE OF EXTREMISM SO QUICKLY AND ELECTION DENIERS RUN IN EVERY SWING STATE DEFINITELY WAS A BIG TASK. I AM JUST SO HAPPY EVERYBODY AT THE DEMOCRATIC ASSOCIATION OF SECRETARIES OF STATE IS OVERJOYED THAT WE STOPPED ELECTION DENIERS FROM BECOMING SECRETARY OF STATE IN EVERY SWING STATE IN THIS NATION WHERE WE HAD A RACE.  AMAZING. THAT'S AMAZING.  CISCO AGUILAR, HOW IMPORTANT IS YOUR WIN?  IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT JUST GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO FLIP NEVADA FROM A REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE TO A DEMOCRATIC SECRETARY OF STATE BUT ALSO, TOO, WE WERE ABLE TO DEFEAT THE CHAIR OF THE AMERICA FIRST COALITION. BEING ABLE TO TAKE OUT THE LEADER IS A GREAT ACCOMPLISHMENT AND IT SHOWS THAT NEVADANS IS GOING TO GIVE THEM A VISION THEY WANT. THIS SHOWS TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. NEVADA WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ELECT THE NEXT PRESIDENT IN '24. THEY KNOW THEIR VOTE WILL MATTER. EVERY VOTE WILL BE COUNTED. WE'LL SECURE OUR ELECTIONS.  CISCO, JIM MARCHANT SAID HE WAS GOING TO FIX NEVADA SO TRUMP COULD CARRY ON. WHEN YOU SPOKE TO NEVADANS, WERE YOU GETTING THE SENSE THAT YOUR ELECTION WAS PRETTY SECURE BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO REJECT THE IDEA OF POLITICS, THEY WERE GOING TO REJECT THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY WOULD PUT THE FIX INTO THE SYSTEM SO THE DEMOCRATS COULD WIN IN NEVADA? WAS IT CLEAR TO YOU AS YOU SPOKE TO PEOPLE ON THE GROUND?  YES, VERY CLEAR. IT WAS BOTH IN OUR URBAN AND OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES. WE SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME MEETING WITH VOTERS IN THE RURAL COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE A STRONG VOICE ABOUT WHAT OUR STATE SHOULD BE AND WHERE WE SHOULD GO IN THE FUTURE. THEY WERE CONCERNED THAT SOMEBODY WAS GOING TO UNILATERALLY WALK INTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE AND DO SOMETHING TO TAKE AWAY THE VOICE OF MANY NEVADANS. WHEN YOU TRY TO SILENCE A COMMUNITY, THAT'S WHEN WE'RE GOING TO STAND UP AND FIGHT BACK EVEN HARDER.  SO SECRETARY GRISWOLD, WHAT IS THE WORK THAT IS AHEAD OF YOU? WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE?  WELL, FIRST OFF, I DO THINK WE HAVE TO REALLY CELEBRATE WHAT WE JUST CAME OUT OF. MAKE NO MISTAKE, WE WERE AT A FORK IN THE ROAD AND THIS NATION COULD HAVE DONE -- GONE DOWN THE PATH OF EXTREMISM, THE BIG LIE ROLLING BACK FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS AND I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MID-TERM ELECTIONS IN AMERICA'S HISTORY. WE WENT DOWN THE RIGHT PATH AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE RIGHT TO VOTE. BUT WITH THAT SAID, THE COORDINATED EFFORT TO ROLL BACK VOTING RIGHTS IS NOT OVER SO DEMOCRATIC SECRETARIES OF STATE, WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO PUSH BACK ON THE CONSPIRACIES. WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TRY TO OPEN UP ACCESS EVEN FURTHER TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY ELIGIBLE VOTER HAS THEIR VOICE HEARD IN THE UP COMING ELECTION IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT.  YUP. CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC ASSOCIATION OF SECRETARIES OF STATE. COLORADO'S SECRETARY OF STATE,EN NA GRISWOLD, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING ON THIS MORNING AND NEVADA'S INCOMING SECRETARY OF STATE CISCO AGUILAR. THANK YOU AS WELL. THANKS TO YOU BOTH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. > AND JOINING US NOW, MAJORITY WHIP JIM CLYBURN. THE THIRD RANKING DEMOCRAT IN THE HOUSE. SO GREAT TO HAVE YOU ON THE SHOW THIS MORNING. FIRST, WE'D LOVE TO ASK YOU HOW YOU WOULD CHARACTERIZE WHAT JUST HAPPENED OVER THE WEEKEND FOR DEMOCRATS?  WELL, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS. I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HISTORY ALL OF MY LIFE. I STARTED WHEN I WAS AN 8-YEAR-OLD STUDYING HARRY TRUMAN AND TOM DEWITT ALL THE WAY THROUGH COLLEGE, TEACHING IT AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL AND I WAS REAL CONCERNED FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT OUR COUNTRY WAS TEETERING ON EDGE. THIS IS A GREAT COUNTRY, I ADMIT IT. VERY CLEAR THAT I BELIEVE IT IS, BUT OUR CHALLENGE IS ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE THIS COUNTRY'S GREATNESS ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE FOR ALL OF ITS PEOPLE. IT LOOKED TO ME THAT SEVERAL ENTITIES IN OUR COUNTRY HAD GIVEN UP ON THEIR PURSUIT OF A MORE PERFECT UNION, HAD DECIDED THAT AUTOCRACY MIGHT BE THE BETTER WAY. AND SO I STARTED SAYING IN OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS SPEAKING TO THE COUNCIL, COMMUNITY'S COUNCIL IN MY DISTRICT, I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO STEP OUTSIDE OF OUR COMFORT ZONES AND MAKE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT CONSERVING THE INTEGRITY OF THIS DEMOCRACY. AND I SAW THAT HAPPEN LAST TUESDAY. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS COMING TOGETHER TO PRESERVE THIS PURSUIT OF A MORE PERFECT UNION. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. STEPPING OUTSIDE OF OUR COMFORT ZONE. THERE ARE A LOT OF REPUBLICANS I TALKED TO, A LOT OF INDEPENDENTS WHO LOOKED UNCOMFORTABLE VOTING FOR DEMOCRATS BUT THEY DID BECAUSE THEY DECIDED TO PUT THE COUNTRY'S FUTURE ABOVE THE POLITICS OF THE MOMENT AND I AM VERY PROUD OF THAT. I AM SO PROUD. I TALKED TO MY THREE DAUGHTERS, MY GRANDSON. WE WERE ECSTATIC OVER THE RESULTS OF LAST TUESDAY.  REMARKABLE. SO, JIM, SO MUCH TO -- SO MUCH TO LOOK AT, AND YOU LOOK AT THAT NEW YORK POST HEADLINE THAT SAYS DENIERS DENIED, THAT PEOPLE THAT WERE ELECTION DENIERS RUNNING AGAINST DEMOCRACY, THEY LOST IN THE SWING STATES. THAT WAS GREAT. AND I LOVE -- I ALWAYS LOVE LOOKING ON THE POSITIVE SIDE OF THINGS. I DO WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT A GUY THOUGH THAT YOU AND I HAVE BOTH KNOWN FOR A VERY LONG TIME PERSONALLY FOR A VERY LONG TIME WHO REPRESENTS PERHAPS I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A DYING STRAIN OF TRUMPISM, BUT LINDSEY. YOU KNOW, LINDSEY'S COME OUT AND MADE SUGGESTIONS THAT ELECTIONS MIGHT BE STOLEN OUT WEST. WE SAW WHAT HE DID. HE'S BEING FORCED TO TESTIFY BEFORE A GRAND JURY BECAUSE HE WAS CALLING THE REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE TWO YEARS AGO IN GEORGIA. THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF GEORGIA WHO GOT RE-ELECTED, IT SEEMED LIKE LINDSEY WAS TELLING HIM TO THROW OUT LEGAL VOTES. I'M JUST WONDERING, DO YOU THINK THAT THE RESULTS OF THESE ELECTIONS WILL MAKE LINDSEY AND OTHER REPUBLICANS RETHINK THEIR TRUMPISM? RETHINK THE ANTI-DEMOCRATIC PATH THEY'VE TAKEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS TO BE ELECTION DENIERS AND TO THROW AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND OUR VOTING SYSTEM INTO DOUBT?  I ABSOLUTELY HOPE SO. NOT JUST LINDSEY AND REPUBLICANS. I HAD SOME OF MY OWN FRIENDS, SOME WHO CALL THEMSELVES DEMOCRATS WHO FELT THAT THIS BOMBASTIC LANGUAGE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY CALL THE ACTIVITIES OF SOME REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WAS THE WAY TO GO. THEY WERE SAYING TO ME, I LIKE JOE BIDEN'S AGENDA BUT I THINK HIS APPROACH NEEDS TO BE BEEFED UP A BIT, NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE MORE IN YOUR FACE. JOE BIDEN'S APPROACH AND AGENDA WERE EXACTLY THE THINGS WE NEEDED IN THIS COUNTRY AND THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE VOTED FOR. PEOPLE VOTED FOR THIS COUNTRY'S GREATNESS. WE ARE A GREAT COUNTRY. WE ARE GOOD PEOPLE AND PEOPLE VOTED TO MAINTAIN BOTH THEIR GOODNESS AND THEIR GREATNESS. I THINK JOE BIDEN IS EXACTLY WHAT WE NEEDED. BACK TEN YEARS AGO I HAD SAID THAT. I SAID WE KNOW JOE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY JOE KNOWS US AND I THINK HE'S WHAT WE NEED FOR 2024 AS WELL.  CONGRESSMAN, MANY PEOPLE KNOW YOU AS A CONGRESSMAN AND A WHIP BUT DON'T KNOW HOW YOU AND YOUR BELOVED LATE WIFE EMILY WERE CIVIL RIGHTS AND VOTING RIGHTS ACTIVISTS IN YOUR YOUTH, THAT'S HOW YOU ALL MET AND CAME ALONG. HOW IMPORTANT IS IT NOW THAT WE HAVE SEEN THE SENATE MAINTAIN DEMOCRATIC? AND IT MAY GO REPUBLICAN MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE BUT NOT BY MUCH? HOW IMPORTANT IS IT NOW THAT WE PRESERVE VOTING RIGHTS AND THIS WE MOVE FROM A CELEBRATION TO REALLY LEGISLATION TO GET THROUGH VOTING RIGHTS LEGISLATION AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE WON FOR, TO HAVE THE VICTORY AND FORGET WHY WE HAD THE VICTORY WOULD BE, IN MY OPINION, SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE VERY DAMAGING.  I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS GEORGIA ELECTION. YOU KNOW, THE FIRST TIME I MET JOHN LEWIS, MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR WAS AT MOORE HOUSE CAMPUS IN 1960. GEORGIA IS STILL AT THE CENTER. WE NEED TO WIN THIS ELECTION, THIS RUNOFF AND I'M CALLING ON GEORGIA, PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO, TO PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE BALLOT. COME OUT AND VOTE IN THIS RUNOFF ELECTION. 51 IS A LITTLE BETTER THAN 50 PLUS 1. THEN WHAT WE'VE GOT TO HAVE IS REALLY SOME CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE. I DO BELIEVE -- WE'VE KNOWN THE VOTING RIGHTS OF 1965 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF REPUBLICANS. I'LL ALWAYS BELIEVE THAT WE MUST BRING REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS TOGETHER THAT ALLOWED LYNDON JOHNSON TO GET THAT ACROSS THE LINE. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS SHOULD COME TOGETHER IN THIS LAME DUCK SESSION AND PASS THE JOHN R. LEWIS VOTER RIGHTS AND ADVANCEMENT ACT SO THAT WE CAN PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS. THE GERRYMANDERING DID NOT WORK AS WELL AS THEY HOPED. IT DID WORK PRETTY GOOD UP THERE IN NEW YORK, BUT IT DID NOT WORK AS PEOPLE HAD HOPED. LET'S STOP ALL THE FOOLISHNESS. LET'S PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE BALLOT. LET'S PASS THE JOHN R. LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT. LET'S PASS A BILL TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT REFORMING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE FAITH AND CONFIDENCE WHEN THEY GO TO THE POLLS THAT THEIR VOTES WILL BE COUNTED.  JIM CLYBURN.  GREAT TO SEE YOU.  WE WANT TO UPDATE YOU. THERE HAS BEEN A SHOOTING ON THE CAMPUS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. THE SHOOTING HAPPENED AT 10:30 LAST NIGHT BUT THE SUSPECT, THE SHOOTER WHO AUTHORITIES SAY IS A STUDENT AT THE SCHOOL, CHRISTOPHER DARNELL JONES, IS STILL AT LARGE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SAY HE IS ARMED AND DANGEROUS. THEY ARE TEXTING STUDENTS, TELLING STUDENTS TO SHELTER IN PLACE AND TO EXPECT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ALL AROUND THE AREA. REPORTS GETTING FROM THE SCHOOL IS THAT THE KIDS ARE IN THEIR DORMS AND THEY'RE SEEING LIGHTS FLASHING EVERYWHERE AND COP CARS CRUISING THE STREETS LOOKING FOR CHRISTOPHER DARNELL JONES WHO ALLEGEDLY SHOT THREE PEOPLE AT LEAST, THREE PEOPLE DEAD AND TWO MORE WOUNDED IN A SHOOTING, A MASS SHOOTING THAT TOOK PLACE AT 10:30 LAST NIGHT ON THE CAMPUS OF UVA. CHARLOTTESVILLE ITSELF IS ALSO ON LOCKDOWN. LOCAL SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED. BUSINESSES ARE CLOSED. AGAIN, THE SHOOTER IS AT LARGE AND IS EXPECTED TO BE ARMED AND DANGEROUS. WE'RE FOLLOWING THAT DEVELOPING STORY AND WE WILL KEEP YOU POSTED. > STILL AHEAD ON \"MORNING JOE,\" PRESIDENT BIDEN IS EXPECTED TO GIVE REMARKS AND TAKE QUESTIONS ON THE HEELS OF HIS MEETING WITH CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING THIS MORNING. WE'LL BRING THAT TO YOU WHEN IT GETS UNDERWAY. YOU'RE WATCHING \"MORNING JOE.\" WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. 20221114132831.338|20221114133234.381",

WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?  HE TOLD ME 2020, HE SAID, BIDEN HAS ENOUGH. HE'S GOING TO GET ENOUGH OUT OF MILWAUKEE. BIDEN'S GOING TO WIN THIS THING. THEN YOU CALL THE GOVERNOR'S RACE AND THE SENATE RACE RIGHT AND YOU SAID BARNES WAS GOING TO COME UP A LITTLE BIT SHORT AND HE DID. I'LL TELL YOU, CHARLIE, FOR ME, WHAT REALLY WAS A SIGN ABOUT TWO DAYS OUT. I GOT MY HANDS ON A POLL FROM A BUSINESSMAN WITH A LOT OF MONEY. IT WAS IN WISCONSIN. PERHAPS THE POLITICIAN, AND I MEAN THIS AS THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENT. PERHAPS THE POLITICIAN WITH THE LEAST CHARISMA IN AMERICA. WAS UP 2 POINTS IN THIS POLL AND THAT WAS GOVERNOR EVERS. THAT WORKED OUT RIGHT. THAT NUMBER POPPED OUT. I SAID, MY GOD, PEOPLE IN WISCONSIN BE. THAT MEANS PEOPLE IN AMERICA WANT NORMALCY. TALK ABOUT THAT. IF YOU WILL, THE SUPER CHARGED POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT OF WISCONSIN. EXPLAIN HOW REMARKABLE IT IS THAT A MAN IS -- AS NORMAL AND STRAIGHTFORWARD AS EVERS WINS IN THE MOST TUMULTUOUS TIMES OF DONALD TRUMP.  WELL, YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. IT'S NOT AN INSULT TO TONY EVERS TO SAY HE LAX CHARISMA. THIS WAS A VOTE FOR NORMALCY. WHAT WAS THE MID-TERM ABOUT. ABORTION, A PUSH BACK AGAINST DENIALISM. TIM MICHAELS, THE TRUMP-BACKED REPUBLICAN FOR GOVERNOR WAS AN ELECTION DENIER WHO WOULD HAVE TURNED OVER CONTROL OF THE ELECTION PROCESS TO PARTISANS. WHAT'S REALLY EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT THIS IS LOOKING AT THE TRENDS. MILWAUKEE'S VOTE WAS ACTUALLY DOWN. TONY EVERS MANAGED TO TURN OUT MASSIVE NUMBERS OF VOTES IN DANE COUNTY. VOTE CREATING IT. BEEN IN DECLINE. BY MORE THAN 90,000. 7 THOUSAND MORE. EVERS WOULD HAVE DONE IT. SOME PEOPLE WILL DO IT. IT WILL HAVE THE DOBBS ISSUE. I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT REPUBLICANS HERE ARE VERY OPENLY SAYING THAT THERE'S NO WAY WITH THE DECISION OF DOING THAT. WHETHER THEY SAY THAT WILL BE A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DECISION.  PRESIDENT BIDEN'S NEWS CONFERENCE LIVE FROM INDONESIA. IT FOLLOWS HIS FACE-TO-FACE MEETING WITH CHINESE LEADER XI JINPING. THE PRESIDENT DELIVERS REMARKS ANY MOMENT NOW. WE'RE GOING TO BRING THEM TO YOU LIVE STRAIGHT AHEAD. 20221114133651.788|20221114134114.667",

        "trs": "> I CAN SAY THIS WITH CONFIDENCE, I WILL NEVER ASK A POTENTIAL DONOR TO CONTRIBUTE MORE THAN I ALREADY HAVE GIVEN. I RUN A TIGHT SHIP. I RESPECT OUR DONORS. THERE ARE TWO THINGS I DON'T DO, I DON'T WASTE MONEY, AND I DON'T LOSE ELECTIONS.  BUT HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED TO US, ELECTION DAY, OUR VOTERS DIDN'T SHOW UP. WE DIDN'T GET ENOUGH VOTERS. A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT. WE'VE GOT TO REFLECT NOW. WHAT DIDN'T HAPPEN? I THINK WE DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH OF A POSITIVE MESSAGE. WE SAID EVERYTHING ABOUT HOW BAD THE BIDEN AGENDA IS, THE DEMOCRATS ARE RADICAL. WE HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN OF WHAT WE STAND FOR.  YOU KNOW, I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO GIVE A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT HERE TO LOBBYISTS ON K STREET. I KNOW THAT WHEN I WAS IN WASHINGTON, I DIDN'T REALLY HANG OUT WITH YOU THAT MUCH. I DIDN'T GO GOLFING WITH YOU. I DON'T GO TO LIKE FOOTBALL GAMES. I JUST DIDN'T DO THAT. I'M KIND OF, YOU KNOW, CRANKY, I DON'T GET OUT VERY MUCH. THAT SAID, I DO FEEL THE NEED AS A PUBLIC SERVICE TO YOU, LOBBYISTS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. AND ACROSS AMERICA, CEOs ACROSS AMERICA, IF YOU WANT TO WATCH YOUR MONEY BURN, IF YOU WANT TO PICK A POLITICAL PARTY THAT WILL LITERALLY BURN MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF YOUR MONEY, THAT GUY, HE CAN DO IT. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CAN DO IT. THEY WASTED SO MUCH OF YOUR MONEY. BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS. INSTEAD OF TALKING ABOUT INFLATION AND TALKING ABOUT, OH, I DON'T KNOW, THE RECESSION, TALKING ABOUT THINGS THAT ACTUALLY IMPACT THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY. THEY TALKED ABOUT YOUR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IF THAT REALLY BOTHERS YOU, GOOD ON YOU, YOU SEND OUT MAILERS FROM FLORIDA TO WASHINGTON STATE, FROM SAN DIEGO UP TO THE FARTHEST REACHES OF MAINE. THEY BURNED YOUR MONEY. YET AGAIN, THEY WASTED YOUR MONEY IN '18. THEY WASTED YOUR MONEY IN '20. THEY WASTED YOUR MONEY IN '22, AND THEY KEEP GETTING MORE EXTREME. YOU GIVE THEM MONEY, AND THEY FIND REALLY EXTREME ISSUES, AND THEN THEY JUST -- THEY LIGHT A MATCH AND PUT YOUR BILLION DOLLARS HERE AND THAT OF COURSE --  YOU HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL THIS MORNING.  DO YOU THINK I'VE HELPED OUT?  I'M TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR NOT SPENDING A LOT OF TIME WITH THEM.  THAT WAS SENATOR RICK SCOTT'S MESSAGE, IN JANUARY OF 2021, VERSUS HIS EXCUSES ON FRIDAY FOR LOSING.  HE SAID HE NEVER LOSES ELECTIONS.  HE JUST DID.  HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO ADJUST.  KIND OF LOST BIG ELECTIONS. I WANT TO GO BACK NOW IF WE CAN. IT REALLY, AGAIN, IT'S CRAZY HOW MUCH MONEY THEY LOST. CHARLIE SYKES, I WANT TO GO BACK TO YOU. WE PLAYED A CLIP GOING INTO THE BREAK WHERE WE'RE ALL SAYING IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A RED WAVE BECAUSE IT DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A RED WAVE, AND TWO POLLS THAT I SAW THE LAST WEEK WHEN EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT THE RED WAVE STUCK OUT. ONE WAS BARNES, THE GREAT MARQUETTE POLL HAD BARNES ONE, TWO POINTS BEHIND. THEY NAILED IT. THE SECOND THING IS I LISTENED TO JOHN RALSTON, THESE RIGHT WING FREAKS, AND TRUMP PROPAGANDISTS WERE RIDICULING JOHN, SAYING HE'S DOING THIS BECAUSE HE HATES LAXALT, ON AND ON AND ON, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE POLLS, YOU CAN SEE THINGS WERE BREAKING IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. I GUESS HERE'S MY QUESTION. LIKE, HOW COULD IT BE THAT CERTAIN WEB SITES, AND CERTAIN NEWS AGENCIES GOT SUCKERED BY ALL OF THOSE PHONY POLLS, GOT SUCKERED BY ALL OF THOSE REPUBLICAN POLLS. ALL GOT SUCKERED. LIKE, I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU, I EXPECT SOME SITES TO FOLLOW IT BECAUSE THEY PLAYED THE RIGHT WINGERS, AND RIGHT WINGERS BELIEVE MITT ROMNEY WAS GOING TO BEAT OBAMA BY ELEVEN POINTS. IF THEY WANT TO BATHE IN STUPIDITY AND IGNORANCE, THEY CAN. I WAS SURPRISED, THOUGH, WHEN I LOOK AT 538, WHICH I NOW GO TO PAUSE THEY'RE THE BEST, THEY'D SAY THERE'S A REPUBLICAN. WAIT, THIS IS PROPAGANDA. WHY ARE YOU PUTTING THIS -- AND I REALLY THINK IT THREW OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE MEDIA. THEY FOLLOWED THOSE RIGHT WING GARBAGE POLLS.  NO, YOU'RE RIGHT. LOOK, I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT OF CONFIRMATION BIAS, A LOT OF WISH CASTING THERE, BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF MEDIA BUBBLES AS WELL, AND I THINK THE REPUBLICANS GOT THEMSELVES CAUGHT IN ALL OF THIS. I WAS THINKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE CONVENTIONAL WISDOM HAD SHIFTED RADICALLY TOWARD THE RED WAVE AND PUNDIT HIVE MIND OUT THERE. I THINK IT WAS SOMETHING YOU SAID EARLIER ABOUT THE REACTION TO THE PAUL PELOSI ATTACK, BECAUSE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS, ONE THING THAT YOU STARTED TO SEE WAS THAT THE REPUBLICANS HAD REALLY INTERNALIZED THE IDEA THAT NOTHING MATTERS, THEY COULD MOCK THE ATTACK ON AN 82-YEAR-OLD MAN. THEY COULD LOOK THE OTHER WAY WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS THROWING KETCHUP AGAINST THE WALL AND ATTACKING PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, CALLING MITCH McCONNELL'S WIFE, COCOA CHAO, THEY BELIEVED THERE WERE NO CONSEQUENCES FOR EXTREMISM, ELECTION DENIAL, THE BAD TASTE, ALL OF THOSE THINGS, AND REALLY WHAT THIS ELECTION WAS ABOUT WAS TELLING THEM, NO, IN FACT, THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES. WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION, AND YOU'RE SCARY. YOU PEOPLE ARE SCARY, AND PEOPLE LIKE RICK SCOTT ARE OUT THERE, YOU KNOW, COMPLAINING ABOUT IT. WELL, LOOK, RICK SCOTT WAS AT THE TABLE. HE WAS THE GUY THAT FLOATED THE IDEA OF, YOU KNOW, CHANGING SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. ALL OF THOSE THINGS, RATHER TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT MOST PEOPLE ACTUALLY WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT. I DO THINK THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TALKED ITSELF INTO BELIEVING THAT THEY WERE LIVING IN THIS SORT OF TRUMPIAN IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE DO OR SAY WORLD, AND NOW WE TAKE UP AND REALIZE, ACTUALLY PEOPLE WANT NORMALCY, AND PEOPLE WERE PAYING ATTENTION TO YOUR LUNACY AND YOUR EXTREMISM IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.  YEAH, AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER RICK SCOTT VOTED AGAINST CERTIFYING THE ELECTION. AND THE GUY STILL WAS PUT IN CHARGE OF THE REPUBLICAN SENATE COMMITTEE. IT REALLY WAS JUST STAGGERING. BUT THERE IS, MIKA, YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS, GRAVITY IS RETURNING. YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED, YOU LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED TO INFO WARS. YOU LOOK WHAT'S HAPPENED TO A LOT OF THESE OTHER PEOPLE THAT WERE ELECTION DENIERS. YOU LOOK IN THE COURTS, THE FEDERAL JUDGES, ONE AFTER ANOTHER AFTER ANOTHER, CHALLENGE BASED ON LUNACY, NOT THE LAW. THROWN OUT REPEATEDLY, AND NOW YOU LOOK JUST AS CHARLIE SAID, YOU LOOK AND THERE ACTUALLY ARE CONSEQUENCES. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S SO FUNNY THAT RICK SAID THAT, WE'D JUST LOOK AT EACH OTHER, DOES NOTHING MATTER ANYMORE.  THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN SEE COMING.  AN 82-YEAR-OLD MAN. THAT'S WHEN I ASKED, WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE WHO RAISED YOU. AND IT ENDS UP THAT A LOT OF GOOD PARENTS RAISED A LOT OF GOOD PEOPLE NOT BECAUSE DEMOCRATS WON AND REPUBLICANS LOST.  RIGHT.  BUT BECAUSE ELECTION DENIERS, PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO UNDERMINE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, PEOPLE WHO WERE MOCKING THE ATTACK OF AN 82-YEAR-OLD MAN, THOSE PEOPLE LOST, AND WE'VE TRIED TO BE VERY CAREFUL. VERY CAREFUL TO TALK ABOUT YOU HAVE SENATE REPUBLICANS, AND FOR THE MOST PART, THEY FOLLOW McCONNELL'S LEAD WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTION DENYING, AND THEY DON'T DO IT. THEN YOU'VE GOT THE HOUSE REPUBLICANS AND A WHOLE LOT OF CRAZY CANDIDATES.  TRUMP REPUBLICANS IN THERE.  TRUMP REPUBLICANS PAY.  AND THE ATTACK ON PELOSI SORT OF INFLAMED THAT BAD, UGLY, NASTY, UN-AMERICAN BEHAVIOR, WHICH, AS CHARLIE SAID, WE HAVE BEEN WATCHING TIME AND TIME AGAIN, A SITUATION THAT APPEARS TO HAVE NO CONSEQUENCES. THERE HAVE BEEN SOME.  GRAVITY RETURNS.  GRAVITY RETURNED AND THE VOTERS PROVIDED CONSEQUENCES. WITH US, WE HAVE U.S. SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT FOR BBC NEWS, KATTY KAY, AND PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN, JON MEACHAM JOINS US THIS MORNING.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US. JON, FIRST OF ALL, I TRIED TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE WITH MY KIDS, MY ADULT KIDS. LIKE JIMMY CARTER TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION WITH 10-YEAR-OLD AMY. I LOVE JIMMY CARTER. I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT TO MY CHILDREN AND PEOPLE CLOSE TO ME, HOW REMARKABLE THIS ELECTION IS. I REALLY CAN'T. THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANY HISTORICAL PARALLEL.  NO, THERE'S NOT. THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PARALLEL TO THE FORCES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT WERE IN CONTENTION. I THINK WHAT THIS WEEK SHOWS US IS THAT FUND MENTALLY, AMERICANS ARE DEVOTED TO THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. I DON'T THINK MANY WENT INTO THE BALLOT THINKING ABOUT THOMAS JEFFERSON, THOUGH I WISH THEY WOULD. I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND THAT AMERICA IS AT ITS BEST WHEN WE EXPAND RIGHTS, WHEN WE BUILD AND NOT WHEN WE TEAR DOWN. AND THAT'S QUIET EXPLICIT IN DOBBS. IT'S QUITE EXPLICIT IN HAVING YOUR RIGHT TO VOTE COUNT. YOU KNOW, I HATE TO PUT IT THIS WAY, BUT FOR A LOT OF WHITE AMERICANS, 2020 WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY ACTUALLY SAW A WORLD WHERE THEIR VOTES WEREN'T GOING TO COUNT. SUDDENLY, WHAT WE DID IN OUR NATIVE REGION, JOE, FOR SO LONG. WAS GOING NATIONAL. AND I THINK PEOPLE SAID, NO, THEY UNDERSTOOD INSTINCTIVELY THE FRANCHISE. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT HAVING -- IT'S VERY HARD IN AMERICAN POLITICS IN LIFE TO HAVE A RIGHT OR A PROGRAM AND THEN TAKE IT AWAY. AND ROE V. WADE, WHATEVER YOU BELIEVE ABOUT THE MORALITY AND THE COMPLICATED ARGUMENTS AROUND IT, IT WAS SETTLED LAW IN THE COUNTRY FROM 1973 UNTIL 2022. AND SO IT WAS PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF AMERICAN RIGHTS. THE RIGHT TO VOTE FOR WHITE FOLKS HAS BEEN PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SUDDENLY, IN 2020, 2021, 2022, NOT ONLY DID YOU HAVE THIS COARSE AND TERRIBLE TONE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, BUT YOU HAD PEOPLE TRYING TO TAKE THINGS AWAY. AND I THINK THE COUNTRY SAID ON TUESDAY AND IN THIS SEASON THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE ARE ABOUT LIVING INTO THE DECLARATION. WE'RE NOT ABOUT PULLING AWAY FROM THAT PROMISE.  AND KATTY KAY, WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT ALSO JOE BIDEN AND JUST IT'S SO FUNNY. I STILL LOOK AT SOME OF THESE MEMES ON TWITTER OVER THE WEEKEND. I'M LIKE, OH, YOU GUYS DIDN'T GET THE MESSAGE. THAT DIDN'T WORK FOR YOU. YOU CAN SAY HE'S NOT WITH IT. YOU CAN SAY HE'S TOO OLD.  FELL OFF A BIKE.  OH, MY GOD, HE FELL OFF A BIKE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. YOU CAN SAY ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND NONE OF THEM BROKE THROUGH IN THE STATES THAT MATTER MOST. NONE OF THEM BROKE THROUGH, LIKE HERE'S A GUY WHO HAS MADE HISTORY WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AND WE TALKED ABOUT -- WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE THAT SLIGHTLY DISAPPROVED OF BIDEN'S PERFORMANCE AS PRESIDENT, THEY STILL WENT WITH HIS PARTY. INDEPENDENCE WENT WITH JOE BIDEN AND HIS PARTY, AND I HEARD PAUL BEGALA SAY IT OVER THE WEEKEND. IT'S PRETTY REMARKABLE THAT EVERY MIDTERM ELECTION IS TO CHECK THE PARTY IN POWER TO PUT BRAKES ON THE PARTY IN POWER. THIS IS THE FIRST MIDTERM ELECTION WHERE VOTERS PUT BRAKES ON THE PARTY OUT OF POWER. NO, NO, NO, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THEM OUT OF POWER BECAUSE THEY'RE INSURRECTIONISTS, WEIRDOS AND FREAKS.  YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK THE PARTY IN POWER EXCEPT FOR WHEN THE PARTY OUT OF POWER IS TRYING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR RIGHT TO AN ABORTION, HAS DONALD TRUMP ON THE TICKET AND IS ACTIVELY INSERTING HIMSELF IN THE CAMPAIGN IN THE LAST WEEK, AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN THE PARTY IN POWER IN THE LAST WEEK RESPONDING TO A HAMMER ATTACK ON AN 83-YEAR-OLD MAN IN A WAY THAT JUST CLEARLY TURNED MOST VOTERS OFF. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, YOU PUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS TOGETHER, BUT YOU ALSO, I MEAN, THAT WEEKEND I SPENT JUST BEFORE THE ELECTION WITH ABIGAIL SPANBERGER, GOING TO THOSE RALLIES WAS A LESSON IN WHY ONE SIDE WON AND ONE DIDN'T. ABOUT GAL SPANBERGER SPOKE ABOUT LOCAL ISSUES. SHE WAS SPEAKING ABOUT --  OKAY. LOST KATTY.  ON POINT ABOUT JOE BIDEN, IT'S SO INTERESTING, YOU ASK, I ASK DEMOCRATS WHO CONSTANTLY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT JOE BIDEN, MAYBE THINK HE SHOULDN'T RUN. MAYBE HE SHOULDN'T COME AND CAMPAIGN WITH ME. LIKE EXACTLY WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? EXACTLY WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT THAT HE'S NOT GIVING YOU. BECAUSE LEGISLATIVE WINS, CHECK. FOREIGN POLICY WINS, WHAT HE'S DOING IN UKRAINE, WE DON'T TALK ABOUT IT ENOUGH, IT'S MASTERFUL, PROBABLY IN THE PROCESS ALONG WITH STRENGTHENING NATO OF SAVING THE WORLD FROM A FASCISM AND A DICTATOR AND THE AGGRESSION THAT IS TAKING OVER UKRAINE, AND WHAT HE'S DOING FOR UKRAINE IS NOTHING SHORT OF MASTERFUL. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT HIS POLITICAL GUT, EVERYBODY ELSE SAID LOOK AT THIS, LOOK AT THIS, LOOK AT THIS, OH, MY GOD, WE'RE GOING TO LOSE. HE FOCUSED ON ABORTION. HE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF WOMEN'S RIGHTS. HE ALWAYS HAS AND HE STAYS WITH IT. HE STAYS TRUE TO IT. AND HE FOCUSED ON DEMOCRACY. HE HELD A SPEECH ON DEMOCRACY, AND EVERYONE WAS LIKE, OH, DID YOU SEE THE SPEECH. HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT THIS. HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT. HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING. WHAT MORE DO PEOPLE WANT. WHO ELSE IS OUT THERE, PLEASE TELL ME.  IT'S INTERESTING, JON, THERE WERE SO MANY TIMES OVER THE FIRST YEAR WHERE PROGRESSIVES WOULD SAY, SEE, YOU CAN'T COUNT ON REPUBLICANS. YOU CAN'T DO BUSINESS WITH REPUBLICANS, THEY ARE EVIL. YOU'VE GOT TO RUN OVER THEM. AND EVERY TIME BIDEN SAID, LET'S TRY TO FIGURE OUT. WE'LL TAKE IT ONE AT A TIME. I'M NOT SAYING ALL PROGRESSIVES. BIDEN HEARD THIS AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL, YOU'RE A FRIEND OF HIS AND WORK WITH HIM ALL THE TIME. HE HEARD THIS ALL THE TIME, HE'S NAIVE. YOU CAN'T WORK WITH THE OTHER SIDE, IT'S TOO HARSH. HE DID. HE GOT A LOT OF LEGISLATION PASSED AND HE TALKED ABOUT DEMOCRACY, HE TALKED ABOUT ABORTION. I HEARD ONE PODCAST AFTER ANOTHER TALKING ABOUT HOW STUPID HE WAS FOR DOING THAT. THERE WERE SOME GREAT CANDIDATES, JOSH -- PENNSYLVANIA, I'M SORRY.  JOSH SHAPIRO.  JOSH SHAPIRO IN PENNSYLVANIA. HOW QUICKLY WE FORGET THE FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. JOSH SHAPIRO TALKS ABOUT ALL THINGS. HE TALKS ABOUT DEMOCRACY, ABOUT ABORTION, HE TALKS ABOUT CRIME. HE TALKS ABOUT INFLATION, BUT IT SEEMS BIDEN MADE ALL THE RIGHT CALLS IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXIT POLLS, BUT NEVER GOT ANY OF THE CREDIT. IT SEEMS TO ME THE MORE WE GET INTO THE BIDEN PRESIDENCY, THE MORE WE REALIZE HE HAS THAT GREAT, GREAT SKILL THAT RONALD REAGAN HAD. HE'S ALWAYS UNDERESTIMATED AND ENEMIES HAVE ALWAYS UNDERESTIMATED HIM, FROM DONALD TRUMP TO VLADIMIR PUTIN, THEY ALWAYS UNDER ESTIMATE HIM, AND IT ENDS UP COSTING HIM IN THE END.  IT'S THE GEORGE W. BUSH. HE IS MIS-UNDER ESTIMATED. AND THAT HAS CONTINUED THROUGHOUT THE DECADES, RIGHT? JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN LEFT FOR POLITICAL DEAD SINCE 1987 AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. I GUESS THAT MAKES SENSE EXCEPT, WAIT, HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AND HE JUST PULLED OFF SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN ARGUE ABOUT HOW MUCH CREDIT HE GETS, WHATEVER, BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHAT WE WOULD BE SAYING IF IT HAD GONE THE OTHER WAY RIGHT NOW. LET'S SAY WITH ALL THE, YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY WITH A PODCAST WOULD BE SAYING RIGHT NOW IF IT HAD NOT GONE THIS WAY. AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, HE'S ABOUT TO TURN 80 YEARS OLD. HE COMES OUT OF A BORDER STATE. HE COMES OUT OF A POLITICAL WORLD WHERE I CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT HIS POLITICAL WORLD, WHICH WAS OURS UNTIL 2017 WAS A DISFIGURATIVE DEBATE, DISFIGURATIVE CONVERSATION. IT WAS A CONSENSUS ON THE REALM OF THE POSSIBLE. THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH THAT. WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE ABLE TO IMAGE MORE, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. BY AND LARGE FOR THOSE DECADES IN WHICH WE DEFEATED A GREAT DEPRESSION, DEFEATED FASCISM, WON THE COLD WAR, HELPED BRING DOWN THE BERLIN WALL, CREATED REMARKABLE PROSPERITY. MANAGED TO EXPAND CIVIL AND VOTING RIGHTS, WOMEN'S RIGHTS, RIGHTS FOR GROUPS THAT FELT MARGINALIZED BEFORE. YOU KNOW, AND I'M NOT TRYING TO DO A TRIUMPHANT NARRATIVE HERE, BUT THAT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENED. DID IT TAKE TOO LONG? YES. IS IT NOT OVER? OF COURSE IT'S NOT OVER. BUT PRESIDENT BIDEN COMES OUT OF THAT WORLD WHERE THE PUBLIC SECTOR COULD MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE. AND IT'S DOING THAT AGAIN NOW. AND BELIEVE ME, HE'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE FROM THAT BELIEF. THAT IS HIM. AND THE COUNTRY WILL DECIDE IN A COUPLE OF YEARS WHETHER THEY WANT MORE OF THIS OR NOT. BUT AS I'VE SAID A LOT. YOU KNOW, JOE BIDEN IS AN UPSIDE DOWN ICEBERG, YOU GUYS KNOW THAT. 95% OF WHAT HE SAYS IN PRIVATE, HE SAYS IN PUBLIC, AND I'M NOT SURE I COULD FIND THE 5%. WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET. MAYBE THERE'S A LITTLE PROFANITY, BUT NOT MUCH. LOOK, HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS TO THE APPROVAL RATING. BUT LOOK, AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS STRONGER TODAY THAN IT WAS SEVEN DAYS AGO. AND JOE BIDEN GETS A LOT OF CREDIT FOR THAT.  YES, HE DOES.  CHARLIE SYKES, WE'LL GIVE YOU THE FINAL WORD.  WELL, IT IS INTERESTING. JOE BIDEN IS OLD AND HE'S SHOWING IT, AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO GET ANY BETTER, BUT DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE A PLAN B. WHAT THEY DO HAVE AFTER TUESDAY IS A PRETTY IMPRESSIVE BENCH, WES MOORE, JOSH SHAPIRO, GRETCHEN WHITMER, WHILE DONALD TRUMP IS IN THE PROCESS OF BURNING DOWN THE REPUBLICAN BENCH, YOU'RE SEEING THE RISE OF A VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE DEMOCRATIC BENCH THAT WILL BE THE NEXT CHAPTER AFTER JOE BIDEN.  CHARLIE SYKES AND JON MEACHAM, THANK YOU BOTH. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF NEWS COMING UP. MAJOR UPDATES FROM THE WAR IN UKRAINE. A SHOOTING ON THE CAMPUS OF UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, THREE DEAD AND AS OF THE START OF THE SHOW THIS MORNING, THE GUNMAN WAS STILL ON THE LOOSE. WE'LL HAVE AN UPDATE ON THAT. > ALSO COMING UP, THE TRUMP EFFECT BOILED DOWN IN A SINGLE HOUSE RACE. WE'LL SPEAK WITH THE DEMOCRAT WHO JUST WON HER RACE IN A DISTRICT IN WASHINGTON STATE WHO HAD A 98% CHANCE OF LOSING BEFORE DONALD TRUMP GOT INVOLVED. WE'LL EXPLAIN THAT. > PLUS, WE'LL GO LIVE TO THE SIDELINES OF THE G20 SUMMIT IN BALI, INDONESIA, FOR THE LATEST ON THE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT BIDEN AND THE LEADER OF CHINA. \"MORNING JOE\" WILL BE RIGHT BACK. ADER OF CHINA. \"MORNING JOE\" WILL BE RIGHT BACK 20221114115016.912|20221114115424.326",

        "trs": " RIGHT NOW DEMOCRATS ARE CELEBRATING THEIR CEILING OF CONTROL OF THE U.S. SENATE AFTER INCUMBENT KATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO WAS DECLARED THE WINNER OF THE SENATE RACE, OVER ADAM LAXALT, OVERNIGHT. GIVING THE PARTY AT LEAST 50 SEATS, ALONG WITH VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA, HARROW A TIE BREAKING VOTE. DEFINING HISTORICAL PATTERNS AND PREDICTIONS OF MAJOR LOSSES. TO GEORGIA, WHERE THE DEMOCRATS ARE NOW HOPE TO INCREASE THEIR CONTROL OF THE SENATE, IN THAT RUNOFF ELECTION, THEY'RE JUST OVER THREE WEEKS, SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK FACES OFF AGAINST REPUBLICAN HERSCHEL WALKER AGAIN ON DECEMBER 6TH. AND JOINING ME NOW, NBC'S CENTENNIAL IN ATLANTA, WARNOCK 'S HIGH SCHOOL EVENT IS ABOUT TO GET UNDERWAY AND ANTONIO WELCOME, TALK ABOUT THE MOOD THERE. WHAT'S IT LIKE AFTER THE DEMOCRATS SECURED THE SENATE? ARE ANY CONCERNS BEING VOICED ABOUT THE ENTHUSIASM GIVEN IT LOOKS LIKE THE SENATE HAS BEEN DECIDED?  YOU KNOW, ALEX, WE ACTUALLY JUST CAME FROM CHURCH, AND I SPOKE TO SOME WARNOCK SUPPORTERS THERE, AND ASKED THEM THAT SAME QUESTION. THEY TOLD ME, IN, ALL THEY OF COURSE ARE DEMOCRATS, THEY THINK THE QUESTION IS MORE FOR THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. NOW THAT THE CONTROL IS OFF THE TABLE, ARE THEY STILL FEELING AS ENTHUSIASTIC? ARE THEY STILL SUPPORTIVE OF REPUBLICAN HERSCHEL WALKER INSIDE SOME OF THE RECORD? AND, SO THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING TO SEE. DEMOCRATS ARE GONNA BE JUST AS ENERGIZED, BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE LOCAL ISSUES, PARTICULARLY THINGS DEALING WITH HEALTH CARE THAT PEOPLE TALK ABOUT A LOT ON THE ROAD THAT ARE AT STAKE HERE, BUT ALSO, HAVING THAT EXTRA DEMOCRAT IN THE SENATE WOULD ONLY BE YOU, KNOW, MORE USEFUL TO THEM. SO THEIR ARGUMENT TO ME WAS THAT QUESTION IS GOING TO REALLY BE FOR REPUBLICANS. BUT BOTH CANDIDATES ARE ALREADY BACK ON THE ROAD, TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF A LISTEN TO THE MESSAGE WARNOCK HAD THIS MORNING AT CHURCH.  YOU ARE THE CHURCH TRADITION THAT GAVE BIRTH TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. AND THE VOTING RIGHTS LAW. SO I'M TELLING YOU, TO GO VOTE.  I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHO TO VOTE FOR. I'M SERIOUS. I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHO TO VOTE FOR. MUST I'LL TELL YOU THAT SOMEWHERE ELSE, NOT HERE. BECAUSE I RESPECT DEEPLY, I RESPECT DEEPLY THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE. GIFT'S  WE ARE LIKELY TO HEAR HIM TALK ABOUT THAT SOMEWHERE ELSE, AND WHO YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR WHEN IT GETS TO THIS EVENT IN A LITTLE WHILE. WHEN WE HAVE A LOT OF PARENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE HERE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS PART OF A LARGER FESTIVAL HAPPENING AT MOREHOUSE TODAY. RAPPER AND MUSICAL ARTIST LITTLE BABY IS GOING TO BE HERE, WHO IS POPULAR WITH THE AGE GROUP BEHIND ME. AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR MORE TALK TAYLOR A MESSAGE TO A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE, A LOT OF YOUNG PARENTS WHO ARE HERE. THIS IS ALL PART OF AN EFFORT THAT IS PART OF BOTH CANDIDATES HAVING TO JUMP START RIGHT NOW. THEY HAVE TO GO BACK OUT TO ALL THESE COMMUNITIES, THEY JUST CIRCLED AROUND, THEY TOOK THE BUSES FROM HERE TO THERE. AND THEY HAVE TO DO THIS ALL OVER AGAIN. THERE HAVE LESS THAN FOUR WEEKS TO DO IT. A LOT OF THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE, HOW DO YOU GET YOUR BASE RE-ENERGIZED? MAKE SURE THEY KNOW THAT DECEMBER 6TH IS THE RUNOFF DATE, AND EARLY VOTING STARTS AFTER THANKSGIVING. SO, THERE'S A LOT OF BASIC EDUCATION, BOTH CANDIDATES HAVE TO DO RIGHT NOW. SO IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING, I THINK, LATER THIS WEEK, AS WE SEE HERSCHEL WALKER HIT THE ROAD TO. HOW DOES HIS MESSAGE MAYBE CHANGE? SINCE IT'S NO LONGER GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW WE CAN TAKE CONTROL OF THE DEMOCRATS, HOW DOES HIS CONNECTION WITH VOTERS CHANGE? WHAT IS HE SAYING? THAT WERE NOT CAMP SAYS A LOT OF HIS MESSAGE IS GOING TO STAY THE SAME. AND HE'S GOING TO RIDE SOME OF THE ENTHUSIASM HE SAYS FROM DEMOCRATS.  YOU KNOW WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THAT RAPPER AND THE FACT THAT THE AGE GROUP BEHIND YOU YOU DESCRIBED, IS GOING TO BE SO EXCITED BY HIM? IT'S GONNA INSPIRE THE PARENTS AND OLDER FOLKS, THE KIDS ARE GOING TO SAY, GET OUT THERE AND VOTE. THAT IS WHAT HE WAS SAYING. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THEIR KIDS AND AS A PARENT, I'M SO ACCOUNTABLE TO MY KIDS SOME DAYS, WOW, OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANTONIO, NO TWO WAYS ABOUT. IT MY NEXT GUEST IS GOING TO BE ADDING UP 1000. PREDICTING DONALD TRUMP'S VICTORY IN 20. 16 AND JUST LAST WEEK RIGHT HERE ON THE SHOW, THE OUTCOME OF THE MIDTERMS. TAKE A LOOK.  I'M NOT WORRIED AT ALL. THIS IS, I THINK THIS IS JUST A THING WHERE PEOPLE GOOD LOOMS, IS PUSHING DEMOCRATS AND LIBERALS, THEY GET REALLY NERVOUS. IN THE HISTORY OF VALID PROPOSALS IN MICHIGAN, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN THIS MANY SIGNATURES. THEY TOLD US THE SAME THING, WHAT KANSAS TOLD US, BACK IN THE SUMMER. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GONNA VOTE, WOMEN ARE GOING TO VOTE, WITH A VENGEANCE. AND PEOPLE OF COLOR KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE. NOT THAT IT'S NOT GONNA BE CLOSE.  MICHAEL MORE JOINS ME NOW, WRITER, FILMMAKER, ACTIVIST, AND I BELIEVE WE CAN NOW OFFICIALLY ADD POLITICAL PROGNOSTICATOR. MICHAEL, MY FRIEND, CONGRATULATIONS. AND WELCOME BACK. YOU DID IT AGAIN. WERE YOU SURPRISED BY THE EXTENT OF SUCCESS FOR DAMS HOLDING ON TO THE SENATE CONTROL WITH THE HOUSE ACTUALLY NO SUCCESS IS LEAVING, STILL EMPLOYED?  NOT SURPRISED AT ALL. I FELT THIS WAY ALL YEAR. I'VE WRITTEN ABOUT. IT I'VE TRIED TO GET THE WORD OUT, PEOPLE WHO SUBSCRIBE TO MY SUBSTACK, OR FOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIA, I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THIS FOR A LONG TIME BELIEVING THERE WERE MORE OF US THAN THERE ARE OF THEM. THAT'S JUST THE STATISTICAL FACT. THERE'S MORE REGISTERED DEMOCRATS IN THE U.S. THAN THERE ARE REPUBLICANS. WE'VE WON SEVERAL OF THE [INTERPRETER] SEVEN OF THE LAST EIGHT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS IN THE VOTE. IT IS CLEAR, THE STATISTICS WERE THERE. I DON'T KNOW WHY I WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO STOP THIS RED WAVE. WE ARE GOING TO PUT UP A BLUE WALL. AND THIS IS GOING TO BE STOPPED. PEOPLE ARE GONNA COME OUT AND IN STATES LIKE, YOU KNOW, THINK ABOUT THIS, IN MARYLAND, MINNESOTA MASSACHUSETTS AND MICHIGAN, ALL HAD A TRIFECTA. WHICH MEANS, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MICHIGAN, 40 YEARS, WE'VE GOT THE GOVERNORS CHAIR, WE'VE GOT THE MICHIGAN HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND WE'VE GOT THE MICHIGAN SENATE. THE DEMOCRATS CONTROL IT ALL, AND THIS HAPPENED ON TUESDAY IN MINNESOTA, MARYLAND, MASSACHUSETTS. AND NOW THERE'S 18 STATES IN THIS COUNTRY. WHERE THE DEMOCRATS ARE ON THE SHOW. THIS IS NOT --  LET ME I WANT TO DRILL DOWN ON MICHIGAN. BECAUSE WE SAW THESE REALLY LONG LINES, LOTS OF YOUNG VOTERS, YOU PREDICTED THAT. IN MICHIGAN. ABORTION IS ONE OF THE TOP TWO ISSUES, VOTERS SAID INFLUENCED THEIR VOTE. AND YOU SINGLED OUT 18 TO 29-YEAR-OLDS, 16% OF THEM WANT TO DEMOCRATS. IT'S A HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN EVEN YOU EXPECTED, MICHAEL, BUT WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT AND DO YOU THINK ABORTION IS GOING TO STAY AN ISSUE, SAY, TWO YEARS FROM NOW?  ABSOLUTELY. IN THE WEEK LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION, IN JUST A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE, ABORTION WAS WAY DOWN THE LIST. IT WAS INFLATION, ECONOMY, CRIME, YOU, KNOW ALL THIS STUFF WHICH IS MEANT TO FRIGHTEN PEOPLE AND YET I SAID TO YOU, WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTION DAY OR WHEN PEOPLE ARE FILLING OUT THEIR BALLOTS AND WOMEN, I MEAN, LET'S -- WHY BE SO CONDESCENDING AND DISRESPECTFUL TO WOMEN TO SAY THAT ON THEIR DECIDING ON REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS OR MILK IS 20 CENTS MORE A GALLON. LET'S SEE, WHICH IS -- YOU KNOW? WHO DO YOU THINK WOMEN ARE? YOU CAN'T TAKE HUMAN RIGHTS AWAY FROM AN ENTIRE GENDER AND NOT EXPECT IT TO BLOW BACK. AND I HAVE TO TELL, YOU THE NIGHT OF THAT SUPREME COURT DECISION, ON JUNE 24TH, I WENT TO BED HAPPY THAT NIGHT THINKING, WOW, THEY JUST HANDED THIS TO US. THEY JUST TURNED THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN, DEMOCRATIC WOMEN, REPUBLICAN WOMEN, INDEPENDENT WOMEN, AGAINST THEM. THE VAST MAJORITY.  LET ME ASK YOU THIS, BECAUSE YOU SAW THAT ON JUNE 24TH. INTERESTING THAT REPUBLICANS IN GENERAL DIDN'T SEEM TO SEE THAT OR AT LEAST THOSE THAT SIT ON THE SUPREME COURT THAT THEY COULD NOT SEE THAT THEY WERE HANDING THIS TO DEMOCRATS, BECAUSE I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU. WOMEN DO NOT WANT TO BE CONDESCENDING DO. WOMEN WERE SAYING, YOU'VE GOT GAS, MY BODILY, RIDES WHAT I CAN DO IN CONTROLLING MAN DUSTIN, THE ONE COME ON?  YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. AND I'LL JUST SAY IT IN MY LANGUAGE, THEY ARE CRUEL. THEY'RE CLUELESS. THERE WERE COOLEST BUT WHERE THEY'RE AT BUT WOMEN ESSENTIALLY -- UNLIKE MOST GROUPS OF PEOPLE, WHEN IT'S PEOPLE OF COLOR, YOUNG PEOPLE, ALWAYS BERATED, THEY NEVER SHOW UP TO VOTE, THEY STARTED SHOWING UP MORE, ACTUALLY, AFTER THE LAST THREE ELECTIONS. THIS IS BEEN TRENDING TOWARDS THIS MOMENT, WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. TO TAKE THE MAJORITY GENDER 51% OF THE POPULATION, AND NOT THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE BLOW BACK FROM THAT, THAT IS JUST LIKE, THANK YOU FOR THAT GIFT, SUPREME COURT, AND REPUBLICAN PARTY, BECAUSE NOW YOU KNOW, YOU IGNORE WOMEN AT YOUR OWN RISK NOW. AND MAYBE THAT WILL BE THE END OF THAT, IT MIGHT BE A HARD THING TO BE A LOT OF SOCIETY AT TIMES. BUT I THINK, I THINK, ALEX, THAT WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO SO MUCH BEING SHOVED DOWN OUR THROATS FROM THE ELECTION TIME. LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION, YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS WERE GONNA LOSE IN MASS. CONSTANTLY, THEY WERE QUOTING HOWELL, IN AMERICAN ELECTION, THE FIRST MIDTERM, AFTER THE PRESIDENTS ELECTED, IS A BLOODBATH. OBAMA LOST 64 SEATS IN THE HOUSE. WHY DID THEY KEEP REPEATING OLD STUFF? WE LIVE IN A NEW CENTURY. WE LIVE IN A NEW ERA. THINGS ARE DIFFERENT NOW. AND THE FACT THAT THEY KEEP REPEATING THE SAME OLD STUFF, KEEP TELLING US THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO GET SLAUGHTERED NONE OF THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. WE'RE STILL WAITING. AND YOU ASKED ABOUT THE HOUSE? I'M GONNA TELL YOU WHAT I THINK ABOUT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. NOW WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT. HAVE THE BEGINNING OF THE, WEEK HE SAID NEVADA, ARIZONA, IN GEORGIA, I SAID WE'RE GONNA WIN ALL THREE, DEMOCRATS ARE GONNA WIN ALL THREE. EVERYONE COME DOWN. AND GEORGIA GOT --  GOT TWO OUT OF THREE --  YES. AND WE WON'T KNOW THAT UNTIL DECEMBER 6TH, LET ME TELL YOU WHY I BELIEVE SENATOR WARNOCK IS GOING TO WIN. HERSCHEL WALKER HAD THE HELP OF KIM BEING ON THE BALLOT. HE BROUGHT OUT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS TO VOTE. HE WON'T BE ON THE RUNOFF BALLOT. IT'S ONLY GONNA BE RUN WARNOCK AND WALKER. AND GENERALLY, AGAIN, PEOPLE OF COLOR, WOMEN, AND YOUNG PEOPLE, ARE THE MOST MOTIVATED, WHEN THE ONLY QUESTION ON THE BALLOT IS THEIR FUTURE, THEY'RE GOING TO COME OUT IN DROVES IN GEORGIA. FOR DECEMBER 6TH RUNOFF. AND I FULLY BELIEVE THAT SENATOR WARNOCK IS GOING TO COME OUT AHEAD. BUT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES -- DO HAVE TIME?  YOU GO.  EVERYBODY INCLUDING EVERY FRIEND AND FAMILY MEMBER OF LINED, IS LIKE, YES WE'RE GONNA LOSE THE HOUSE. WHO SAID? IT'S BEEN FIVE DAYS SINCE THE ELECTION AND THEY STILL HAVEN'T CALLED THE HOUSE. HAVE YOU EVER REMEMBER THAT HAPPENING WHERE THE HOUSE ISN'T CALLED FOR FIVE DAYS? YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS? BECAUSE IT'S CLOSE. IT IS SO CLOSE, THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON, SO COUNT IN CALIFORNIA, AND ALL THE EARLY WORD IS, FROM CALIFORNIA, WE HAVE A CHANCE, DEMOCRATS HAVE A CHANCE TO PICK UP SIX, SON, MAYBE EVEN EIGHT REPUBLICANS SITTING CONGRESSMAN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE GONNA SWITCH TO THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. HELP MAKE UP FOR THE HORRIBLE MISTAKE BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. WHICH REALLY WOULDN'T SO MUCH OF THE PARTY, ANDREW CUOMO'S MAP. ORDERED TO BE REDRAWN, WHICH WAS REDRAWN WRONG, BECAUSE, IN NEW YORK STATE, HE DID NOT CARE ABOUT HELPING DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, WHATEVER, HE CARED ABOUT PATRONAGE, OF REWARDING THOSE WHO REWARDED HIM. AND THAT MAP WAS A MESS. AND NOW WE'VE LOST FOUR MEMBERS OF NEW YORK CITY. I THINK WE'RE GONNA PICK THEM UP IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK THIS THING IS REALLY CLOSE, AND MY FRIENDS, EVEN IF IT DOES COME OUT TO 18 TO 17, IN FAVOR OF THE REPUBLICANS, OR TO 19 TO 16, THERE'S HARDLY A SESSION OF CONGRESS AND THIS LAST ONE, 117 SESSION, THERE WERE TWO REPUBLICANS CALL WHO DIED. THAT HAPPENS IN EVERY CONGRESS, EVERY TERM, AND THE WOMAN SADLY IN A CAR ACCIDENT IN THE MIDWEST, REPUBLICAN, WHAT HAPPENED IN ALASKA? THE DEMOCRAT WON. EVEN IF FOR SOME REASON TO 19 TO 16 CAN'T HOLD, AND ALL YOU NEED, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE QUIT IN CONGRESS, PEOPLE GET INDICTED, THERE'S LOTS OF REASONS WHEN THE SESSION BEGINS AT 2:19, IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY END AT 2:19. SO, ALL WE HAVE TO DO LET'S JUST SAY WE DON'T WIN THE HOUSE, WE JUST PICK RIGHT UP, GET TO WORK, GET READY FOR THE NEXT SPECIAL ELECTION, TO GET THE NEXT WOMAN ELECTED, DEMOCRAT, FOR THAT SEAT. AND I WANT PEOPLE WATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW. YOU'VE GOT A START, I'M TALKING TO DEMOCRATS, TO LIBERALS, YOU'VE GOTTA START BELIEVING IN YOURSELF. YOU'VE GOTTA BELIEVE, WE CAN WIN THIS. IT'S NOT JUST A CHANCE NOW. EVERYONE I'VE TALKED TO, MY SOURCES, IN CONGRESS AND IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WHO TALKED TO ME, THEY'RE ACTUALLY GETTING VERY EXCITED. BECAUSE IT'S MORE THAN JUST A CHANCE NOW OF WINNING THE HOUSE. WE MAY HOLD THE HOUSE WE MAY NOT. BUT THERE'S A MUCH STRONGER CHANCE. AND PEOPLE, YOU NEED TO START WILLING THIS TO HAPPEN. BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, BELIEVE IN THE REST OF THIS COUNTRY, AND THE MAJORITY OF YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS WANT THIS COUNTRY TO DO BETTER, BE BETTER, TRUMP IS NEVER COMING BACK. THAT'S THE END OF TRUMP. YOU NEED TO BELIEVE THAT, QUICK BEING SO AFRAID. I'M TALKING TO YOU LIBERALS. LIBERALS, LEFTIES, MONTESSORI PARENTS, ALL OF YOU. YOU'VE GOTTA -- AND THE FACT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE IT COUNTED YET, CAN I JUST SAY, IN CANADA, THEY, WHEN THEY HAVE AN ELECTION, THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS COUNTED BY 11 PM. I, MEAN PARLIAMENT, PRIME MINISTER, EVERYTHING IS KNOWN AT 11 PM ON THE ELECTION DATE. THAT'S THE SECOND LARGEST LAND MASS ON THE PLANET, CANADA, AND BY 11:00, THOSE BALLOTS, BY THE WAY THEY VOTE ALL PAPER BALLOTS, AND IN THE VIEW PLACE OF COMPUTERS, BUT THEY SOLVED OF A PAPER BALLOT. A LOT OF THEM VOTE WITH THE NUMBER TWO PENCIL. AND THEY KNOW THE WINNERS BY 11 PM. I'M TELLING, YOU THEY BRING THOSE BALLOTS, IN ON DOGS LUGS, ON THE BACKS OF BABY SEALS, I MEAN, THEY GET THOSE VOTES IN, AND I'M GOING, WHAT IS WRONG WITH US? AND A CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IS ONLY 750,000 CITIZENS. THAT'S ALL. AND YET WE ARE THIS CLOSE, THINK ABOUT, THAT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, THAT WE MIGHT ACTUALLY PULL THIS OFF, THAT FIVE DAYS LATER IT IS SO, SO CLOSE --  CAN I TELL YOU, MICHAEL MORE, I AM SO GLAD TO GIVE YOU THE PLATFORM TO TALK ABOUT THIS -- TWO POINTS A PICK UP ON. THE FIRST THING IS. HE JUST SAID THAT TRUMP IS GONE. WE'RE GOING TO HOLD YOU TO THAT ONE. WE'RE GOING TO SEE HOW THAT DEVELOPS AND CAN I TELL YOU THAT A FAMILY MEMBER --  HE'S NOT GONE, HE WILL NOT RULE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AGAIN.  THANK YOU FOR THAT. TOTALLY AGREE WITH THAT. AND ALSO I WANT TO SAY A FAMILY MEMBER SENDS THIS AND SAYS LISTEN TO MICHAEL MOORE IS GIVING ME CHILLS WITH A SMILEY FACE. VERY GOOD REACTION. MY FRIEND -- GOOD SKILLS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I KNOW WE'LL SEE YOU AGAIN. MEANTIME, -- BREVITY IS THE SILHOUETTES WANT TO MAKE A 41 -- FILED BY TEAM TRUMP AS THE CLOCK STARTS RUN OUT. LISA REUBEN JOINS US NEXT.

        "trs": "IT TAKES 218 SEATS TO WIN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. AND AT THIS HOUR, REPUBLICANS APPEAR TO HAVE THE BROADEST PATH FORWARD TO DOING THAT. STILL THOUGH, THE BALANCE OF POWER COULD TIP EITHER WAY IN THE DAYS TO COME, WITH 22 HOUSE RACES ACROSS NINE STATES STILL WAITING TO BE CALLED. JOINING ME NOW, WE HAVE FORMER CALIFORNIA SENATOR, BARBARA BOXER, AS WELL AS JULI\u00c1N CASTRO, FORMER HUD SECRETARY, FORMER 2020 DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE AND AN MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST. WELCOME, BOTH OF YOU. SENATOR, YOU FIRST HEAR BECAUSE AS WE WATCH TO SEE WHICH PARTY TAKES CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, YOUR STATE, MY STATE TO, BY THE WAY, CALIFORNIA HAS 11 RACES THAT ARE STILL NOT CALLED. THERE WAS CERTAINLY PLENTY OF FAIR WARNING THAT THE RESULTS COULD TAKE A WHILE, BUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT CALIFORNIA THAT THERE ARE SO MANY RACES OUTSTANDING? BUT  SO MANY RACES, SO MANY VOTERS, SO MANY PEOPLE. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE ALMOST 40 MILLION PEOPLE. WE HAVE SO MANY WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE, SO EVERYONE JUST HAS LEARNED HERE THAT YOU HAVE TO BECOME CALM ABOUT IT. BUT YOU'VE GOT -- I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. THIS IS LIVE, THIS IS TERRIBLE. SORRY ABOUT THAT.  IT HAPPENS.  OH GOSH, I'M SO SORRY, I'M SO SORRY.  THAT'S OKAY!  IT JUST SHOWS THAT WE HAVEN'T REHEARSE. SO, I GUESS WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS IT'S HARDER HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE MOST VOTERS, FOR SURE. AND THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO VOTE, WHICH IS SO WONDERFUL. BECAUSE YOU CAN VOTE, YOU KNOW, ON THE SAME DAY EVEN, YOU CAN VOTE BY MAIL, YOU CAN VOTE AT A DROP BOX, ALL THESE DIFFERENT WAYS. SO, IT'S ALL HAPPENING AND IT'S ALL HAPPENING SAFELY AND SOUNDLY. WE HAVE A REALLY GREAT RECORD FOR SECURE ELECTIONS.  YEAH, VERY TRUE. SECRETARY, THE DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION, THE NEW YORK TIMES WARNED THAT THE BIGGEST SURGE OF MISINFORMATION MAY ARRIVE AFTER ELECTION DAY, SAYING PEOPLE WHO STUDY DISINFORMATION ARE WARNING THAT FAR RIGHT INFLUENCERS WILL SEIZE ON BALLOT COUNTING POLICE AND OTHER ROUTINE ISSUES, AS EVIDENCE OF FRAUD. SO, WITH BOTH CHAMBERS OF CONGRESS STILL UNCERTAIN THIS WEEKEND, ARE YOU WORRIED THAT THERE IS A DISINFORMATION PROBLEM BREWING?  WELL, OF COURSE THAT CONCERNS ME. AFTER WHAT WE SAW HAPPEN IN 2020, THAT WAS THEIR TRIAL RUN. LOOK WHAT IT LED UP TO, EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED ON JANUARY SIX. THEY'VE BEEN CONTINUING THAT KIND OF CHATTER WHETHER YOU GO ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE, YOU'VE HAD POLITICIANS AS WELL, MORE HIGH-PROFILE ONES, INCLUDING DONALD TRUMP, THAT ARE BEATING THE SAME DRUM, TRYING TO DELEGITIMIZED OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. THEY'RE DOING THAT NOT ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE RESULTS IN 2022, BUT ALSO, OF COURSE, FOR HIS PRESIDENTIAL RUN IF HE MAKES ONE IN 2024. SO, ABSOLUTELY. NOT ONLY THAT, ALEX, YOU ADD IN THE FACT THAT TWITTER HAS JUST BASICALLY IMPLODED AND FOLKS CAN DO THIS UP UNTIL 48 HOURS AGO, TWITTER BLEW AND -- PUT SOMETHING OUT THAT SEEMS LEGITIMATE, MAKES IT EVEN HARDER TO TELL WHETHER IT'S ACCURATE OR NOT, IT'S REAL. AND YOU HAVE A VERY FIRM SITUATION FOR MISINFORMATION.  YEAH, I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU, THAT'S JUST WILD WHAT'S HAPPENING TO TWITTER. BUT LET'S MOVE ON TO THIS, SENATOR, WITH NEVADA AMONG THE STATES STILL, RATHER, TO CLOSE TO CALL IN THE SENATE. POLITICO IS REPORTING ON A REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE CALL THAT HAPPEN ON THURSDAY. SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM SUGGESTED, FRAUD IF ADAM LAXALT IS NOT DECLARED THE WINNER,. REPORTEDLY SAYING, QUOTE, THERE IS NO MATHEMATICAL WAY LAXALT LOSES. IF HE DOES, THEN IT IS A LIE. YOU SERVED WITH LINDSEY GRAHAM IN THE SENATE. I'M CURIOUS OF YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT AND THAT KIND OF RHETORIC FROM HIM. DOES IT SURPRISE YOU?  NOT AT THE LEAST. THIS IS A GUY WHO SAID HE IS IN LOVE WITH DONALD TRUMP ONE DAY, AND DONALD TRUMP'S A MASTER THE NEXT DAY. SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH MY FRIEND. HE HAS LOST IT. BECAUSE NOBODY IS BUYING THIS. EXCUSE ME, IF SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THE ELECTORAL COUNT, WHY ISN'T HE SAYING THAT THE REPUBLICAN BE DECLARED THE WINNER? IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE, THAT THAT IS NOT TRUE. SO, THEY ARE SO FULL OF IT AND THEY'RE SO AFRAID BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE MATH. IT IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE SAYS. THE VOTES TO BE COUNTED ARE THE ONES THAT ARE LEANING DEMOCRATIC. SO, I THINK LINDSEY GRAHAM HAS TO LOOK HIMSELF IN THE MIRROR AND SAY, WHICH LINDSEY AM I GOING TO BE? THE GOOD LINDSAY OR THE BAD LINDSEY? AND IF HE DOESN'T PICK THE GOOD LINDSEY, THEN HE'S GOING TO BE REJECTED BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SICK OF ALL THIS BALONEY. LOOK, I LOST A RACE MY VERY FIRST ONE. IT IS TOUGH. YOU BETTER JUST STEP UP AND SAY, I LOST, I GOT TO DO BETTER THE NEXT TIME. YOU DON'T START POINTING FINGERS AROUND. THAT IS WHAT THEY'RE SO FRUSTRATING. THEY EXPECTED A RED WAVE. INSTEAD, THEY GOT A READ STOP SIGN. STOP, WE DON'T WANT TO KIND OF AMERICA YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT THEY GOT.  SECRETARY, YOU ARE PART OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WHEN REPUBLICANS HAD CONTROL OF THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE. IF THAT REPEATS THE NEXT TWO YEARS, WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THE DEMOCRATS AGENDA? WHAT CAN AND WHAT CAN'T GET DONE?  WELL, ALEX, FIRST OF ALL I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS ARE OVERJOYED THAT WE DIDN'T SEE THAT RED WAVE, AS SENATOR BOXER SAID. WE'VE SEEN EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. SO, I HOPE THAT DOESN'T COME TO PASS. BUT IF IT DOES, WHAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF GROUNDLESS INVESTIGATIONS THE WAY THAT THEY DID BENGHAZI AND SEVERAL OTHER INVESTIGATIONS A FEW YEARS AGO. WE ARE GOING TO SEE THEM BLOCKING PRESIDENT BIDEN'S AGENDA AND MAYBE MOST DISTRESSINGLY, WE ARE GOING TO SEE THEM GO AFTER SUCH IMPORTANT PROGRAMS LIKE MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY. WE ARE GOING TO SEE THEM ATTEMPT A NATIONAL ABORTION BAN. ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THIS ELECTION SAID, NO, WE DON'T WANT THIS. THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO TRY BECAUSE I THINK THIS PARTY IS SO EXTREME AND THEY'RE MARCHING TO THE BEAT OF DONALD TRUMP STILL, EVEN THOUGH, YOU KNOW, RIGHT NOW THEY'RE QUEASY ABOUT IT. I THINK THEY'RE GETTING HIM BACK IN LINE. THEY ARE GOING TO FIND THEMSELVES -- WON'T CARRY OUT HIS AGENDA AND AT LEAST TRY IT. THANKFULLY, AS PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS SAID, HE'S THERE TO VETO THE EXTREME PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT THEY WOULD PUT OUT.  YOU REALLY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET BACK IN LINE, CONSIDERING WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF THE VOTE AND WHAT APPARENTLY THE PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE SAYING? MAYBE THEY DON'T WANT HIM TO BE IN LINE WITH DONALD TRUMP AND MAGA.  HERE'S WHY I THINK THEY MAY WELL GET ALIGNED. BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TODAY IT'S DEADLY AFRAID OF THEIR BASE AND THE BASE STILL HAS BEEN QUITE LOYAL TO DONALD TRUMP. IF AND WHEN THAT BASE THAT GETS OUT THERE, REMEMBER, IN PARTY PRIMARIES, REALLY IS PEOPLE THAT ARE SUPER MOTIVATED. IT IS THAT BASE. AS LONG AS THAT BASE IS BEHIND DONALD TRUMP, THEN MOST POLITICIANS ON THAT SIDE OF THE AISLE WILL ULTIMATELY CARRY OUT HIS AGENDA.  LET ME JUST ASK YOU THIS. WHERE WOULD THAT BASE GO? WHERE WOULD THE MAGA BASE GO?  INSTEAD OF DONALD TRUMP, IT MIGHT GO FOR RON DESANTIS, SOMEBODY THAT HAS LESS BAGGAGE, BUT BASICALLY HAS THE SAME --  WOULDN'T THAT BE GOOD FOR REPUBLICANS IN MANY WAYS? I MEAN, WOULDN'T THAT ADD, IF THEY DID GO THERE, JUST AWAY FROM MAGA AND ALL THIS ASSOCIATED WITH DONALD TRUMP. WOULDN'T THAT MAKES MAYBE BOLSTER THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?  THESE ELECTION RESULTS WOULD SEEM TO SAY SO. BUT, I MEAN, YOU STILL DO HAVE A LOT OF AREAS IN MY STATE OF TEXAS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES WHERE BECAUSE OF THE GERRYMANDERING, IT'S VERY FIRMLY BASE REPUBLICANS IN THOSE DISTRICT CONTROLLING WHO GETS ELECTED. SO, THAT'S NOT HOW THESE POLITICIANS ARE GOING TO ACT. REMEMBER, THESE POLITICIANS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO LOOK OUT FOR, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO LOSE AN ELECTION, I'M GOING TO SAVE MY JOB. AND IF THEY THINK THAT SAVING THEIR JOB MEANS LOYALTY TO DONALD TRUMP, THEN THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE LOYAL TO DONALD TRUMP.  HEY ALEX.  -- JOINING.  FOR JUST A MINUTE, IF I COULD WEIGH IN HERE, HERE'S THE DEAL. IF YOU LOOK AT RON DESANTIS, HE PREACHES TRUMPISM. SO, I THINK YOU'RE MAKING A GOOD POINT. IT'S GOING TO BE BETTER? HEY, IT MAY BE BETTER FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. BUT FOR THE PEOPLE, THEY'VE JUST REJECTED ABORTION BANS. HE'S GOT THE WORST ONE IN THE COUNTRY. THEY REJECTED THE POLITICS OF HATE, WHERE HE PUT INNOCENT PEOPLE ON BUSES AND TRACKED THEM ACROSS THE COUNTRY, MAKING THEM LOOK LIKE FOOLS. I MEAN, EVERYTHING HE DOES, HE'S TELLING PARENTS IF YOU'VE GOT A CHILD THAT NEEDS CERTAIN MEDICAL PROCEDURES, YOU CAN'T DO IT UNTIL THEY'RE 18. I MEAN, HE'S TELLING PEOPLE WHAT BOOKS TO READ. SO, YOU GO ON AND ON, AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEATHS THROUGH THE PANDEMIC, THE ONE OF THE WORST STATES. SO, YOU KNOW, IT MAY BE TRUE THAT AT FIRST, THE REPUBLICANS DO BETTER. MY HOPE FOR THE COUNTRY IS THEY NOT ONLY DUMP TRUMP, BUT THEY DUMP TRUMPISM. THAT IS THE KEY.  SENATOR, LET ME ASK YOU IN THE BRIEF TIME WE HAVE LEFT, BECAUSE -- LOS ANGELENO AM CURIOUS ABOUT THAT MAYORAL RACE. I MEAN, IT HAS BEEN NECK AND NECK FOR SOMETIME. INCREMENTAL BACK AND FORTH HORSE RACE. WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE AND DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHO'S GOING TO PULL IT OUT?  ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT -- TAKING OVER THE LEAD THERE.  SLIGHTLY.  THE REASON I CAN TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, WELL, HE WAS IN THE LEAGUE SINCE THE GET-GO AND SHE JUST TOOK OVERLY THERE. SO, WHAT I CAN'T TELL YOU IS THE CHARACTERIZATION OF WHAT VOTE IS LEFT. YOU KNOW? WHERE IS IT COMING FROM? WOULD IT BE STRONG CARUSO? WOULD THEY BE STRONG BASS? SO SADLY, I'M NOT, YOU KNOW, I CAN'T BE A FEW TOURISTS HERE, BUT I CAN SAY THESE ARE TWO DEMOCRATS, HE BECAME A DEMOCRAT FROM BEING A LIFELONG REPUBLICAN. MY SENSE IS, KAREN HAS SOME MOMENTUM AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO EVERYBODY, I HAVE ENDORSED HER. SO, I WANT YOU TO TAKE THAT FOR WHAT YOU THINK IT IS. BUT I DO THINK THE MOMENTUM HAS SHIFTED AND DEPENDING ON WHERE THESE VOTES ARE FROM, YOU KNOW, WE COULD FIND OUT. I JUST DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.  OKAY, WELL I THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER YOU DID GIVE US BECAUSE IT WAS PRETTY GOOD! I WANT TO THANK YOU BOTH AS WELL, SECRETARY, SENATOR, THANK YOU BOTH. COMING UP NEXT, A CHECK ON THE GEORGIA SENATE RACE AND THEN LATER ON, WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS HEADLINE AND YOU ARE GOING TO SEE IT NOW. THE SUPREME COURT LOCKED REPUBLICANS IN THE MIDTERMS. DO YOU AGREE? DISAGREE? WE WILL HAVE SOME ANALYSIS AHEAD. WE WILL HAVE SOME ANALYSIS AHEAD. 20221112183154.011|20221112183441.229",

        "trs": "DEMOCRATS ARE ONE WIN AWAY FROM HOLDING THE MAJORITY IN THE U.S. SENATE. JUST IN THIS LAST HOUR, ARIZONA SENATOR, MARK KELLY, DELIVERED A VICTORY SPEECH IN PHOENIX AFTER NBC NEWS CALLED THE RACE IN HIS FAVOR. THIS IS WHERE THINGS STAND RIGHT NOW. AND HERE'S PART OF NBC'S STEVE KORNACKI'S REPORT LATE LAST NIGHT ON THE BREAKDOWN OF THE SENATE RACE.  IF CORTEZ MASTO ENDS UP WINNING NEVADA, ON TOP OF WHAT WE JUST SAW IN ARIZONA TONIGHT, DEMOCRATS WOULD WIN BOTH OF THOSE SEATS, WOULD HAVE 50 SENATE SEATS WITH THAT, THEY WOULD BE GUARANTEED TO CONTINUE THEIR CONTROL OF THE CHAMBER WITH KAMALA HARRIS'S TIE BREAKER VOTE. AND THAT GEORGIA RUNOFF, WHICH WILL STILL TAKE PLACE ON DECEMBER 6TH, WOULD ONLY BE TO DECIDE WHAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE 50 OR 51 SEATS. FOR CONTROL THAT IN HIS SCENARIO WOULD NOT BE AN ISSUE.  AND ON THE HOUSE SIDE, NBC NEWS PROJECTS REPUBLICANS ARE ON TRACK TO TAKE CONTROL WITH 220 SEATS TO DEMOCRATS 215. BUT THAT REMAINS ALL WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR AT THIS POINT. I'M GOING TO BRING IN ROB -- FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY IN THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, NOW AT MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST. A GOOD FRIEND OF OURS, IT'S GOOD TO SEE, ROBERT. LET'S GET INTO IT HERE. HOW MUCH OF THE RESULTS WE ARE SEEING TODAY DO YOU THINK COULD BE CREDITED TO YOUR FORMER BOSS STEPPING INTO THOSE TIGHT RACES AND PLAYING THE ROLE OF CLOSURE AND BRINGING ALL THE ENTHUSIASM UP A BUNCH OF LEVELS?  WELL, LOOK, I THINK HE PLAYED A BIT OF A ROLE, PARTICULARLY IN SOME OF THE SWING STATES, ALEX. I THINK YOU HAVE TO GIVE CREDIT TO A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT CIRCUITS. YOU'RE SHOWING A PICTURE OF CURRENT PRESIDENT, JOE BIDEN, AND FORMER PRESIDENT, BARACK OBAMA, WHO BOTH DESCENDED ON PENNSYLVANIA LAST WEEKEND. AND WE SAW BIG RESULTS THERE. JOE BIDEN WENT TO PLACES LIKE NEW MEXICO, AND OREGON, AND NEW YORK, THOUGHT TO BE WORRISOME GOING INTO TUESDAY THAN REELECTED DEMOCRATS OVERWHELMINGLY. SO, I THINK CERTAINLY FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA PLAYED A ROLE AND CURRENT PRESIDENT BIDEN PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE. AND I THINK YOU JUST SERVED TO GET DEMOCRATS WERE ENTHUSIASTIC THAN THEY ALREADY LIKELY WERE.  I'VE GOT TO SAY, I WISH MY DIRECTOR WOULD KEEP THAT PHOTO UP, THAT VIDEO GOING OVER THE TWO OF THEM WALKING. THAT'S A LOT OF FANTASY. SPEAKING OF TUNE, THE MAIN FACTORS, ROBERT, THAT APPEARED TO HAVE DRIVEN VOTER TURNOUT FOR DEMOCRATS WERE DONALD TRUMP AND THE SUPREME COURT DECISION OVERTURNING ROE V. WADE. RIGHT NOW, OUR TRUMP IN THE GOP LOOKING SOMEWHAT SELF INFLICTED WOUNDS?  I THINK SO. BUT LET'S ALSO BE CLEAR, LOOK, I WOULD SAY THE SUPREME COURT WAS THE MOST VALUABLE PLAYER IN THIS ELECTION. BUT UNDERSTAND, REPUBLICANS, JUST LIKE THE REST OF THE WORLD, KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE SUPREME COURT WAS GOING TO DO WHEN THAT DECISION LEAKED ON MAY THE 2ND. THEY HAD SIX MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT HOW NOT TO LAND ON WHAT ABOUT 10% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SUPPORT. THAT IS NO EXCEPTIONS FOR ABORTION. EXACTLY, AGAIN, 10% OF THE PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. IF YOU ARE ALIGNING ON POLICIES THAT 90% OF THE PEOPLE OPPOSE, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO DO VERY WELL ON ELECTIONS. IF YOU THROW IN SOMEBODY LIKE TRUMP AND, YOU KNOW, TAKE THE MICHIGAN EXIT POLL FOR EXAMPLE. 33% OF THE PEOPLE IN MICHIGAN THINK THAT JOE BIDEN ISN'T THE ELECTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WE SOMETIMES DWELL ON THAT NUMBER, BUT THAT MEANS TWO THIRDS THINK HE IS. AND SO, THEY ARE LINING ON THESE POSITIONS THAT ARE JUST FAR, FAR OUT OF THE MAINSTREAM. WHY THE REPUBLICAN IN MICHIGAN DID SO POORLY, WHY GRETCHEN WHITMER FOCUSED ON JOBS, HEALTH CARE, THE WOMEN'S RIGHTS TO CHOOSE, ENDED UP IN MICHIGAN DOING FOUR POINTS BETTER THAN JOE BIDEN DID JUST TWO YEARS AGO. AND I THINK IT SHOWS YOU THE STRENGTH OF THE TURNOUT AND THE SUPREME COURT FRANKLY OF THE BENCH THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE.  BUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE, ABORTION, I MEAN WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, IF CHIEF JUSTICE, JOHN ROBERTS, HAD BEEN ABLE TO FLIP ONE CONSERVATIVE JUDGE AND THEN TAKE THE ISSUE OF ABORTION OFF THE MINDS OF VOTERS, IT REALLY COULD'VE CHANGED HISTORY FOR REPUBLICANS. PRESIDENT BIDEN REITERATED PLANS TO -- AN ATTEMPT AT A FEDERAL BAN ON ABORTION IF REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL OF CONGRESS. SO, WHAT DOES IT TELL YOU ABOUT THE NEXT TWO YEARS IF THERE'S A SPLIT GOVERNMENT?  WELL, I THINK IF THERE'S A SPLIT GOVERNMENT, I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE BASICALLY THE 2024 RACE COME AT US STARTING JANUARY 5TH OF 2023, RIGHT? WE MAY SEE THAT ALREADY, BUT I THINK IT WILL PLAY OUT INSIDE THE HALLS OF CONGRESS. AND YOU WILL HAVE TWO VERY DIFFERENT AND COMPETING DIVISIONS. I THINK THE REAL CHALLENGE FOR REPUBLICANS, PARTICULARLY IF THEY CONTROL THE HOUSE, BY JUST TWO VOTES, THAT'S, GOING TO BE AN ENORMOUSLY HARD CAUCUS TO CORRAL TO GET ANYTHING DONE. AND I THINK THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THINGS THAT PUT THEMSELVES OUTSIDE OF THE POLITICAL MAINSTREAM IS EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH. I THINK DEMOCRATS CAN CAPITALIZE ON THAT FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS. I THINK DIVIDED GOVERNMENT IS GOING TO BRING A LOT OF THINGS THAT AMERICANS DON'T LIKE, A LOT OF THE BICKERING, A LOT OF FOOD FIGHTS, IF YOU WILL. BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW, THE ONUS IS ON REPUBLICANS TO SOMEHOW GET THEIR PARTY AND THEIR BELIEF SYSTEM IN LINE WITH WHERE THE MAINSTREAM AMERICA'S. BECAUSE ON TUESDAY, AMERICANS DECIDED THEY WERE TOO EXTREME TO SUPPORT IN THIS ELECTION.  I WANT TO GET YOUR QUICK THOUGHTS TO THIS AS WE PLAY THIS REMARK FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN POST MIDTERM NEWS CONFERENCE. WE WILL WATCH THIS TOGETHER.  75% OF VOTERS SAY THE COUNTRY IS HEADING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION DESPITE THE RESULTS OF LAST NIGHT. WHAT IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS DO YOU INTEND TO DO DIFFERENTLY TO CHANGE PEOPLES OPINION OF THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY, -- CONTEMPLATE A RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2024?  NOTHING BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST FINDING OUT WHAT WE ARE DOING. THE MORE THEY KNOW ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING, THE MORE SUPPORTERS.  DOES THE ELECTION, ROBERT, DOES THE OUTCOME GIVE HIM LICENSE TO SAY THAT? DO YOU AGREE?  WELL LOOK, I WILL SAY THIS. I'M NOT A HUGE FAN OF THE QUESTION, IS THE COUNTRY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION? MY HUNCH IS THAT A LOT OF DEMOCRATS GOING INTO THIS ELECTION DIDN'T THINK THAT ELECTION DENIALISM WAS LEADING THIS COUNTRY INTO THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SO, I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCORECARD, ESSENTIALLY, OF THIS ELECTION, I THINK THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE CAN BE PRETTY PROUD OF WHAT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION. BUT ALSO IT LEADING THE DEMOCRATIC EFFORT TO TURN OUT VOTERS AND GET THEM EXCITED TO THIS ELECTION. SO, I THINK THAT'S TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT. I HAVE NO DOUBT THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO HAVE TO TWEAK A BIT OF ITS STRATEGY, PARTICULARLY IF REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. MY GUESS IS THAT BIDEN JUST DID NOT WANT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THAT ON WEDNESDAY.  ALL RIGHT, SPEAKING OF PROUD -- YOUR FRIEND AND ALL OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SHOW. SO WE WILL SEE YOU AGAIN SOON. THANK YOU, ROBERT. EVER GIVE OFFENSE AND REALLY GET ADVICE AND THEN THAT FOUND IGNORES THE ADVICE, AND THEN ACTUALLY DOES SOMETHING TO MAKE THE SITUATION WORSE? WELL, THAT IS WHAT LIFE IS LIKE THESE DAYS FOR REPUBLICANS WHO LOVE AND ADMIRE YOU KNOW WHO. LOTS OF DEEP SIGN NEXT. F DEEP SIGN NEXT F DEEP SIGN NEXT ferently with Chase. 20221112185139.229|20221112185300.126",

THERE COULD BE SUCH BIG SWINGS IN THE VOTE THAT COMES IN BECAUSE IT IS LATE ARRIVING MAIL BALLOTS, MAIL BALLOTS THAT WERE DROPPED OFF ON ELECTION DAY. IT'S PILES OF BALLOTS THAT THEY PROCESS, VERY SLOWLY, SO YOU GET THESE UPDATES MAYBE ONCE A DAY, ONCE EVERY FEW DAYS AND THE NUMBERS SLOWLY TICK UP. SOME OF THESE DISTRICTS WILL NOT BE CALLED MAYBE IN A GYM UNTIL DECEMBER.  WHAT A PREDICTION THERE FROM NBC NATIONAL POLITICAL KORNACKI STEVE KORNACKI. JOINING ME NOW IS PENNSYLVANIA CONGRESSWOMAN MADELEINE DEAN. -- AS I WELCOME YOU, FIRST OF ALL, YOUR REACTION FROM WHAT YOU HEARD STEVE KORNACKI JUST SAY, DECEMBER?  WELL, I HAVE TO ADMIT, I HOPE STEVE GET SOME SLEEP, MY GOD HE HAS BEEN DOING SOME AMAZING REPORTING. I DON'T THINK THAT IS ENTIRELY SURPRISING. THESE ELECTIONS, AS YOU SAW IN PENNSYLVANIA, A RAZOR THIN IN SOME CASES. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT EVERY VOTE COUNT. WE KNOW IN GEORGIA, WE'RE HEADED TO A RUNOFF. I'M PATIENT. BELIEVING THAT EVERY VOTE SHOULD COUNT. AND BELIEVING THAT WHAT IT REALLY REVEALS IS THAT THERE WAS NO RED WAY, DEMOCRATS DID EXTRAORDINARILY WELL.  THEY DID. IN FACT, MAJOR VICTORIES THERE IN PENNSYLVANIA, ON TOP OF YOUR OWN REELECTION, WHICH I'M APPLAUDING. DEMOCRATS HAVE ADDED TWO NEW HOUSE MEMBERS, SECOND DEMOCRATIC SENATOR, A NEW DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR. HOW SIGNIFICANT ARE THESE WINDS FOR PENNSYLVANIA AND DEMOCRATS IN GENERAL?  IT'S EXTRAORDINARY. I REALLY WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE VOTERS OF PENNSYLVANIA. YOU SAW IN THE TOP RACES, OUR GOVERNOR ELECTION SHAPIRO WINNING BY 14 POINTS OVER A TRUMPSTER, AN INSURRECTIONIST, TO ACTUALLY ATTENDED JANUARY 6TH AND BROKE TO POLICE BARRICADES. YOU SAW ON THE FETTERMAN RACE, PEOPLE THOUGHT MAYBE COULDN'T WIN, HE WON BY A THING FIVE POINTS, 45 POINTS, SO YOU SAW THAT PENNSYLVANIANS, VOTERS, SAW THROUGH, NUMBER ONE THE LIES, THE DECEPTION AND THE FEARMONGERING. THEY ALSO SAW THE QUALITY OF THE CANDIDATES. IT WAS A STARK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN OUR OWN CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION, THE TOP RACES LIKE SUSAN WILD AND MATT CARTWRIGHT, THEY WANT. AND THE TWO NEW SEATS IN PITTSBURGH, OUR FIRST AFRICAN WOMAN MAYOR AMERICAN MEMBER OF CONGRESS, AND A VETERAN CHRISTIAN LUCILLE. DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT DID EXTREMELY WELL. SOMETHING ELSE I WANTED TO POINT OUT TO, IT IS SO PENNSYLVANIA AND SO THIS ELECTION CYCLE, IS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE HOUSE. I USED TO SERVE THERE FOR SIX YEARS. LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE THERE. IT LOOKS LIKE HISTORICALLY, WE MIGHT TAKE THE MAJORITY. WE HAVE BEEN IN THE MINORITY, DEMOCRATS, IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE, FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. BUT RIGHT, NOW WE HAVE 101 SEATS. WE NEED 103 TO BE THE MAJORITY. TWO OF THE SEATS THAT ARE IN PLAY RIGHT NOW LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE GOING TO GO OUR WAY. IT WAS A HUGE NIGHT FOR PENNSYLVANIA.  WOW. IT SEEMS LIKE PENNSYLVANIA A PIECE TO BE A UNIFORM COLOR THESE, DAYS AS OPPOSED TO PURPLE AS THAT HAS BEEN. LET ME ASK YOU WHAT YOU'RE DOING RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS RUNNING FOR VICE CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS, WHICH IS HOLDING ITS LEADERSHIP ELECTION LATER THIS MONTH. WHY DO YOU WANT TO SERVE IN THIS POSITION? WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESPONSE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES?  THANK YOU FOR ASKING ME ABOUT THAT. I'M VERY EXCITED TO MAKE THIS RUN TO BE A PART OF OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM. WHAT I'VE SAID TO EVERY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IS THAT I WANT TO BE AS USEFUL AS POSSIBLE IN THIS 118TH CONGRESS, WHETHER WE ARE NOW THEY'RE NOW REALLY IN THE MAJORITY, OR NARROWLY IN THE MAJORITY, IT'S GONNA BE EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT THAT EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS BE THERE. YOU KNOW WHAT DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS? IS IT IS OURS. IT IS OUR MOST IMPORTANT BODY WHERE WE TELL OUR LEADERSHIP WHAT MATTERS, WHAT OUR DISTRICTS NEED, WHAT OUR DIFFERENCES ARE. SO, I WANT TO DO THAT TO MAKE SURE EVERY VOICES HEARD IN A TRUSTED PLACE. I SAID IN MY LETTER, -- I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT WORKING IN A COMPLICATED FAMILY, WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT CAUCUS IS. A BIG, ROBUST, THEM LAY. AND I WANT TO BE THERE AS VICE CHAIR TO HELP LIFT EVERY VOICE, EVERY DISTRICT, SO THAT OUR POLICIES AND LEGISLATION WE PUT FORWARD REFLECTS HER BEAUTIFUL DIVERSITY.  THAT IS A VERY INTERESTING COMMENT TO MAKE A BEING THE YOUNGEST OF SEVEN CHILDREN AND A VERY IMPORTANT POINT TO MAKE. -- IF PEOPLE WANT BOTH PARTIES TO MOVE FROM THE FRINGES BACK TO THE CENTER, LET'S LISTEN TO HER RESPONSE.  AS SOMEONE WHO IS OFTEN CHARACTERIZED AS EXTREME, I OF COURSE WITH OBJECT TO THAT. I DO NOT BELIEVE THAN I AM THAT EXTREME IN THE WAY THAT MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE ON THE PUBLIC REPUBLICAN SIDE IS EXTREME. THE IDEA THAT THERE IS AN EQUATING OF BELIEVING IN SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES AND GUARANTEE UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES THAT UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE SHOULD INCUR PHYSICAL HARM SOMEHOW IN THE SAME LEVEL OR STREAM IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD OBJECT TO.  DO YOU AGREE WITH AOC THERE? TO PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATS NEED TO DEFINE THIS TO AMERICANS, THE WAY SHE JUST?  I THINK SHE DID DRAW THAT OUT PERFECTLY. IT'S A FALSE EQUIVALENT TO CALL ALEXANDRIA EXTREME AT THE IS THE SAME AS MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. WHAT SHE IS THIS PROGRESSIVE. AND I HAPPEN TO ENJOY BEING A MEMBER OF THE PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS AND THE NEW DEMOCRATS COUGH KISS. WE HAVE TO CALL OUT WHICH IS JUST PLAIN FALSE. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE AND HABITS THE FALSEHOODS OF TRUMP WORLD, WHICH I WANT TO SAY WE'RE SO RESOUNDINGLY ILL REJECTED. EVEN IF SHE WINS REELECTION, THEY WERE REDOUNDED LEE REJECTED. DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO REMAIN RELEVANCE, BUT THIS REELECTION WAS A REFERENDUM ON A COUPLE OF THINGS. NUMBER, ONE A REFERENDUM ON WILL WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ELECTIONS IN IRAQ? NO IS THE RESOUNDING CALL FOR MANY OF THESE RACES. AND NUMBER TWO, WILL WE CONTINUE IN EROSION OF PEOPLES RIGHTS, LIKE HEALTH CARE AND ABORTION RIGHTS? VOTERS CAME OUT IN STRONG NUMBERS TO SAY WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT WOMEN'S RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, EQUAL RIGHTS, AND WE ARE GOING TO REJECT THE FEARMONGERING AND ELECTION DENYING OF THOSE WHO STILL CLING TO DONALD TRUMP.  ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE'LL KEEP A VERY CLOSE EYE ON THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP ELECTION. I WISH YOU LUCK ON THAT MY FRIEND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. MY NEXT GUEST SAID THERE WILL BE NO RED WAIF. -- AND WHY HE SAYS ABORTION EXTREMISM COULD COST REPUBLICANS FOR DECADES TO COME. TO COME 20221112172334.044|20221112172725.110",

        "trs": "NOW TO BREAKING NEWS IN UKRAINE. REMARKABLE SCENES IN THE SOUTHERN CITY OF KHERSON TODAY, AS RUSSIA RETREATS AND THE UKRAINE MILITARY TAKES CONTROL OF THAT AREA. JOINING ME NOW IS MOLLY HUNTER IN KYIV, UKRAINE. MOLLY WELCOME. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT TAKE BACK OF THE TERRITORY. WHAT'S THE LATEST?  A SIGNIFICANT TAKE BACK OF THEIR OWN TERRITORY. A HUGE MILITARY LOSS FOR RUSSIAN PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN. I WANT TO GET STRAIGHT TO OUR PARTNER SKY NEWS, WHICH WAS ONE OF THE VERY FIRST PEOPLE TO GET INTO KHERSON TODAY. TAKE A LISTEN.  IT FEELS LIKE BIG FUTURIST COMING HERE.  DID YOU EVER THINK THIS WOULD BECOME -- ?  FROM THE VERY FIRST, DAY I KNEW IT WAS COMING FOR SURE.  NINE MONTHS OF OCCUPATION?  YES. YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING YOU LIVE FOR. AND THIS WAS THE MOMENT TO LOVE FOR. A NEW LIBERATION IS NOT SOMETHING HAPPENING EVERY YEAR. IT'S SOMETHING IN FIVE GENERATIONS AND IT'S HERE TO STAY.  NOW, ALEX, YOU HEAR INTERVIEWS THAT ALEXA'S DONE OUT OF KHERSON CITY TODAY WITH RESIDENTS. THEY ALL SAY THEY BELIEVE, THEY KNEW THE UKRAINIAN MILITARY WAS GONNA COME AND LIBERATE THIS AREA. IT'S NOT JUST KHERSON CITY. IT'S ALSO THE VILLAGES AND TOWNS AROUND IT. WE'VE SEEN VIDEOS OF THEM CHEERING, KISSING, AND SINGING THE UKRAINIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM AS THE UKRAINIAN MILITARY COMES THROUGH. THESE ARE NOT JUST PEOPLE HAVE DEALT WITH BRUTAL RUSSIAN OPERATIONS, THEY'VE BEEN WITHOUT HOT WATER, ELECTRICITY, GAS, ALSO WITHOUT CONNECTION TO THE OUTSIDE WORLD. YOU SAW PICTURES TODAY OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET CONNECTIONS AS THESE FOREIGN JOURNALISTS CAME IN, CALLING THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS IN OTHER PARTS OF UKRAINE, WHO HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE ALIVE, WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE SAFE IN KHERSON. USING POLICE FOR SAYING TONIGHT IS THAT THE NATIONAL POLICE IS UP AND RUNNING IN KHERSON CITY. THEY'RE TELLING PEOPLE, DON'T COME BACK TO HER SUN CITY JUST YET. LET US DE-MINE THE AREA. LET US MAKE THE AREA SAFE FOR CIVILIANS BEFORE PEOPLE COME BACK ALEX.  I GOTTA TELL, YOU ARE ALMOST IN TEARS JUST LOOKING AT THE JOY IN PEOPLE'S FACES, LISTENING TO IT, IT'S PRETTY DARN COOL. WHAT A WONDERFUL TIME. AND THAT ONE MAN WHO TOOK HIS TIME SAYING, IT FEELS LIKE VICTORY IS COMING. LET'S ALL HOPE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MOLLY.  WHAT I THINK THEY'RE DOING IS SLOW ROLLING OUR VICTORY. THEY WANT TO TAKE THE AIR OUT OF THIS MOVEMENT. AND THEY CAN'T DO IT.  LET'S GO BACK TO THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS NOW WITH JUST INFORM THAT THERE ARE 1000 OUTSTANDING VOTES TO COUNT IN THE KEY STATE OF ARIZONA. YOU JUST HEARD THAT TRUMP BACK ELECTION DENIER KARI LAKE ACCUSING OFFICIALS OF SLOWING THE VOTE COUNT AS SHE TRAILS INCUMBENT KATIE HOBBS BY JUST OVER 30,000 VOTES. BUT ARIZONA ELECTION OFFICIALS ARE HITTING BACK.  THEY ARE ALREADY WORKING 14 TO 18 HOURS A DAY. THEY ARE MAKING A GREAT COMMITMENT. WE CANNOT GO ANY FURTHER THAN THAT. WE ARE DOING WHAT WE CAN AND STILL MAINTAINING ACCURACY.  MAINTAINING ACCURACY. THE KEY WORDS THERE. ARIZONA DEMOCRAT MARK KELLY IS KEEPING HIS SENATE SEAT OVER CHALLENGER BLAKE MASTERS, PUTTING DEMOCRATS JUST ONE WIN AWAY FROM MAINTAINING THEIR SENATE MAJORITY. RIGHT, NOW SIMON ROSENBERG, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER OF THE NEW DEMOCRAT NETWORK. A VETERAN OF TWO PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES. -- ALSO THE STRATEGIST WHO CALLED IT EARLY, SAYING THE RED WAVE HAD NOT ARRIVED. -- YOU WERE ALL OVER MY SHOW LAST WEEKEND. TO YOU IT WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT EVEN A BLUE SURPRISE. BUT FIRST, FOLLOWING UP TO THAT REPORT FROM GEORGIA, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SCORECARD THERE, WITH REPUBLICANS WINNING ACROSS THE BOARD, EXCEPT FOR HERSCHEL WALKER, GOVERNOR, SECRETARY OF STATE, ATTORNEY GENERAL, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WALKER'S INABILITY TO WIN?  WELL, WE KNOW THAT THERE IS BEEN A WIDE REJECTION OF MAGA, THE RIGHT WAY PHILOSOPHY OF DONALD TRUMP THAT REPLACED CONSERVATISM A FEW WEEKS YEARS AGO AS A GOVERNING IDEOLOGY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. -- DEMOCRACY, DEMOCRATS, JOE BIDEN, OR ALL THE BIG WINNERS OF THIS ELECTION. YOU SAW MANY OF THESE EXTREME CANDIDATES ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY LOSE. YOU JUST HAD A REPORT FROM ARIZONA, WHERE THE REPUBLICAN GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE THERE IS ONE OF THE PREMIER ELECTION DENIERS IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS IS BEEN A GOOD DAY. A GOOD WEEK FOR THE UNITED STATES IN AMERICA. I THINK PEOPLE CHOSE NORMALCY. THEY WANT TO GET BACK TO THEIR LIVES AFTER COVID. THEY DID NOT WANT MORE CHAOS AND CRAZINESS. THAT 11 OUT IN THE ELECTION THIS PAST. WEEK  YOU CALL THE PRETTY ACCURATELY SO FAR. DO YOU CARE TO GIVE YOUR PROTECTION FOR NEVADA?  YES, I THINK WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE IN ARIZONA. I THINK WE ARE GOING TO WIN THE SENATE RACE IN NEVADA. I THINK CORTEZ MASTO IS IN GOOD SHAPE THERE. I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA WIN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE, BUT THE REAL INTERESTING STORY TO ME IS WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE. THERE'S A WIDE BELIEF NOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET UP TO 2:16, 2:17, THE HOUSE MAY JUST BE DECIDED BY A SINGLE SEAT. IT'S UNIMAGINABLE. EITHER WAY, AND WE ARE NOT GIVING UP THE IDEA THAT WE COULD ACTUALLY RUN THE HOUSE. THAT'S WHERE I THINK A LOT OF THE DRAMA'S GONNA BE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T HAD A HOUSE THIS CLOSE IN A LONG TIME. CAN I JUST SAY ONE THING? THE CORE ARGUMENT THAT MY PARTNER AND I WERE MAKING OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS WAS THAT WE WERE NOT SEEING A RED WAVE, WE WERE SEEING A CLOSE COMPETITIVE ELECTION, WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY CLOSE ELECTION.  WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT QUESTION. YOU ARE ALREADY -- THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS ARE GONNA PLAY OUT, YOU'RE LOOKING AT KANSAS AND MICHIGAN IN PARTICULAR. WHAT DO YOU THINK ABORTION EXTREMISM IS GONNA COST REPUBLICANS AS YOU SAY FOR DECADES TO COME, ESPECIALLY IF SOME STATES SETTLE THE QUESTION, AS WE SAW HAPPEN ON TUESDAY?  I THINK THIS IS SUCH AN EXTREME ASSAULT ON FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS THAT THIS IS GOING TO CAUSE, WHAT I CALLED BRANDEN GRADATION, THE DEGRADATION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY BRAD FOR TENS OF MILLIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO MAY NEVER VIEW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THE WAY THAT THEY DID EVER AGAIN. IT'S SO PERSONAL. FOUR WOMAN TO LOSE BODILY AUTONOMY, IS A LOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN X COSTING 30 CENTS MORE. THE REPUBLICANS REALLY SCREWED UP. THIS WAS BAD POLICY. IT'S VERY UNPOPULAR. IT'S GONNA CAUSE EXTRAORDINARY HARM TO MANY, MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. I THINK IT'S VERY POSSIBLE, AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR REPUBLICANS TO UNDERSTAND THE GRAVITY OF WHAT'S HAPPENED TO THEM, BECAUSE THIS WAS SEEN AS A VICTORY FOR THEM. IT WAS A SUCCESS. 50 YEARS OF FIGHTING ROE VERSUS WADE, AND THEN THERE WAS A POPULAR UPRISING AGAINST. THE POPULAR UPRISING MAY CONTINUE FOR ELECTION AFTER ELECTION TO COME. THE REPUBLICANS MIGHT SAY HEY, THEY DID SOMETHING REALLY STUPID AND BAT, AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY AN EXTRAORDINARY PRICE, NOT JUST THIS ELECTION BUT FUTURE ELECTIONS ALSO.  BUT YOU SAY REPUBLICAN SCREWED UP, BUT COULDN'T YOU ALSO SAY THE SUPREME COURT SCREWED UP? LOOK AT THE LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THE SUPREME COURTS RIGHT. NOW RECORD LOWS. DOES THE SUPREME COURT ULTIMATELY TO BLAME?  MITCH MCCONNELL IS TO BLAME. HE WAS THE ARCHITECT OF THE CURRENT 63 MAJORITY IN THE SUPREME COURT. -- IF THEY HADN'T SNEAK THAT'S SIX JUSTICE IN IF THEY BITE DENYING MERRICK GARLAND TO BE APPOINTED BACK IN 2016. -- THE REPUBLICANS HAVE -- THEY HAVE UNDERPERFORMED EXPECTATIONS. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE GRIP OF MAGA IT'S GONNA BE LOOSENED ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THAT THE LIST CHENEY WIN OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WILL BE STRENGTHENED AND EMBOLDENED. HOPEFULLY WE'LL START TO SEE THE RETURN OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT WHICH FEELS MORE LIKE A CENTER RIGHT POLITICAL PARTY IN AMERICA.  OKAY. BUT HOW MUCH DOES THAT PREDICTION, THAT HOPE HAPPEN, DEPENDING ON DONALD TRUMP NOT ULTIMATELY RUNNING? OTHERWISE THAT'S GONNA PUSH THAT OFF FOR A LONG TIME?  OR PERHAPS HE RUNS AND GETS BEAT. WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THAT IN THE NEW A NEW POLL, TODAY HAS THE FIRST TIME DESANTIS BEATING TRUMP THAN A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY. I THINK THE AIR IS COMING OUT OF THE BALLOON FOR DONALD TRUMP AND MAGA. YOU SAW THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ATTACKING DONALD TRUMP FOR BEING A LOSER THIS WEEK. YOU SAW THE NEW YORK POST MOCKING DONALD TRUMP, ANOTHER RUPERT MURDOCH PUBLICATION. I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE AN EFFORT BY MANY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO THROW MAGA AND DONALD TRUMP UNDER THE BUS FOR THIS VERY DISAPPOINTING ELECTION. WE KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP IS NOT GONNA BE EXCITED ABOUT THAT. I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT OF DRAMA AHEAD. I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE HAVE SEEN MAGA PEAK NOW, AND THAT IT IS GONNA WOW THE MORE REASONABLE MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO TAKE THEIR PARTY BACK FROM THE EXTREMISTS WHO HAVE TAKEN IT OVER IN RECENT YEARS.  YOU ARE WELCOME ON THE SHOW ANYTIME. -- WELL DONE. THANK YOU SO. MUCH  ALEX, THANK YOU SO MUCH.  GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, HERE'S A PROGRAMMING NOTE FOR ALL OF. YOU TOMORROW WE WILL TALK TO STEPHANIE GRISHAM, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR FOR MILLENNIA TRUMP. THE FORMER PRESIDENT IS BLAMING HER, -- WE'LL HAVE THAT AT NOON EASTERN FOR YOU. THEN AT ONE EASTERN, FILMMAKER AND PODCASTER MICHAEL MOORE IS GONNA GIVE US HIS TAKE ON THE WAY FORWARD, AFTER DEFYING MOST PREDICTIONS OF WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TUESDAY'S ELECTION. THAT'S TOMORROW STARTING AT NOON, HERE ON MSNBC. THE ONE THING THAT CAN HURT HERSCHEL WALKER'S CHANCES IN A RUNOFF, AND DONALD J TRUMP IS ALL FOR IT. THAT'S NEXT.

AT THIS HOUR, REPUBLICANS ARE PROJECTED TO WIN 220 SEATS COMPARED TO DEMOCRATS TO 15, WITH A TOTAL OF 218 NEEDED TO CONTROL THE LOWER CHAMBER. THERE ARE STILL 22 OUTSTANDING HOUSE RACES YET TO BE CALLED IN NINE STATES. DEMOCRATS STILL HAVE A PATH TO MAJORITY. AMID ALL THIS POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY, LET'S BRING IN ALICIA JOHNSON -- AND MICHAEL SINGLETON, HOST OF SCREEN SHARE AND POLITICAL INSULT CONSULTANT FOR MSNBC ON PEACOCK. WELCOME TO BOTH OF. YOU THIS RED WAVE THAT WASN'T. --  ALEX, I THINK WHAT MITCH MCCONNELL SAID SIX MONTHS AGO, CANDIDATE QUALITY DOES MATTER. I THINK YOU JUST HAD SIMON ON, AND I WAS RECENTLY LISTENING TO AN INTERVIEW HE DID WITH RICK WILSON, ON JUST HOW DETACHED MANY OF THOSE CANDIDATES WERE FROM MANY ISSUES THAT VOTERS REALLY CARE ABOUT. -- YOU EVEN HAD A STATE LIKE ARKANSAW, I BELIEVE, OR KANSAS I BELIEVE, THE TRY TO PASS A BILL TO HAVE STRICTER ABORTION LAWS, AND ALMOST EVERY SINGLE COUNTY, INCLUDING THOSE THAT WERE FOR DONALD TRUMP, VOTED WITH A DEMOCRATS. THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CONSERVATIVE COUNTIES. FOR ME IT IS STRATEGIST, A LOOK AT THESE THINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND I'M THINKING, HOLY SMOKE, THIS IS A GREAT ARGUING POINT FOR THE BASE, BUT ONCE YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT, THE -- WHICH HAS TO BE MORE THAN JUST YOUR BASE. I THINK REPUBLICANS HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT. FOR ME, I'M LOOKING AT THIS AS A MOMENT TO RESET, THE PARTY HAS TO GO TO A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. DONALD TRUMP IS MORE OF A LIABILITY. TAKE ALL THOSE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION, I WOULD ADVISE MY FORMER PARTY TO SAY HEY, WE NEED TO LOOK ELSEWHERE IN 2024.  IF YOU LOOK ALENCIA, DESPITE THE PRESIDENT'S APPROVAL RATINGS IN THE LOW 40S, YOU HAD DEMOCRATS THAT WERE PRETTY MUCH ABLE TO DEFY HISTORY. WAS IT SOMETHING THEY DID RIGHT OR AGAIN, WAS A MORE BUT REPUBLICANS PUTTING FOR THESE ILL EQUIPPED CANDIDATES?  I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF A LOT OF THINGS. LET US BE VERY CLEAR. THE THE HOBBS DECISION AND DRIED OUR BASE. IT WAS A DECIDING ISSUE FOR YOUNG VOTERS, PEOPLE OF COLOR. IT WAS THE REASON WHY WE WERE ABLE TO REGISTER MANY NEW AND FIRST-TIME VOTERS, PARTICULARLY WOMEN. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOWS US THAT WE SPEAK TO AN ISSUE THAT IS SO PERSONAL, AND ABORTION IS NOT ABOUT JUST HEALTH, CARE IS ABOUT FREEDOM. WHAT THAT'S WHY DEMOCRACY SO IMPORTANT. WOULD BECAUSE WE HAVE LOST THIS RIGHT, IN OUR GENERATION, IN OUR LIFETIME, THEN WHAT ELSE ARE THEY ABLE TO? DO IT'S ABOUT REPUBLICANS BEING EXTREME ON ISSUES WE CARE ABOUT, AS WELL AS THESE HORRIBLE CANDIDATES. -- IN FEBRUARY, THE CONSERVATIVE SUPREME COURT SAID IT'S ILLEGAL TO RACIALLY GERRYMANDER, SO WE ARE ALSO FEELING THE IMPACT OF THAT. DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD STRONG. AS YOU SAID BEFORE WE JOINED THIS PANEL, THERE COULD BE A POSSIBILITY THAT DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY KEEP THE HOUSE. IT'S A COMBINATION OF BAD CANDIDATES, STAYING ON THESE EXTREME SIDES OF THESE ISSUES, AND SOME OF THE THE CHEATING TO THE REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE, IT STILL DIDN'T GET IN THE WAY OF OUR BASE.  SHERMICHAEL, WAS A MIDTERM RESULTS VIA THE DIFFERENT ELECTION IF THE SUPREME COURT, WITH THIS THREE TRUMP APPOINTED JUSTICES, HADN'T OVERTURNED THE PRECEDENT LAW IN THE LAND WITH ROE?  I THINK IT'S PROBABLY DIFFICULT TO ARGUE NOT ALEX. I HAVE MY OWN PERSONAL REASON ON ABORTION. BUT AS A MATTER OF STRATEGY, AND LOOKING AT THE INITIAL LIKE THAT, AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF, IF WE ACTUALLY GET WHAT WE WANT, IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR THE BASE, AND THEY'LL BE HAPPY AND SATISFY. BUT MATT MATHEMATICALLY, I'M COMPARING MY BASE, TO THE VOTERS THAT WE NEED, HOW ARE THEY GONNA REACT TO THIS PARTICULAR PLACES WHERE I KNOW THAT FIVE TO 8% OF THEM ARE NEEDED TO WIN? IF THE RESULTS ARE GONNA TELL ME THEY'RE GONNA BE ON THE NEGATIVE OF, THIS I'M THINKING, GUYS, WE HAVE TO PAUSE THE BRAKES ON THIS. WE MAYBE GET WHAT WE WANT, BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS COME MIDTERMS. I DON'T THINK THERE WAS REALLY ANYBODY ARTICULATING THAT POINT TO REPUBLICANS. I KNOW WE WANT, THIS IS WHAT WE REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS WILL IMPACT THE PARTY IN THE LONG RUN. -- A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WOULD LOVE TO SEE REPUBLICANS GET BACK TO BEING THE PARTY THEY WERE TEN YEARS AGO, BUT WE CAN DEBATE ON ISSUES AND WE CAN DEBATE ON ECONOMICS AND FOREIGN POLICY AND DIVESTING POLICY ET CETERA, BUT I THINK FOR A LOT OF VOTERS, WHILE THEY DON'T NECESSARILY LIKE THE DIRECTION OF THE COUNTRY, LOOK AT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S APPROVAL RATING FOR EXAMPLE, THEY ABSOLUTELY HATE WHAT'S COMING FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. MANY OF THEM SAY, I DON'T LIKE THINGS FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN, THE ECONOMY, OR IMMIGRATION OR WHATEVER THEY WANT TO THROW THE MIX, BUT OH MY, GOD I'M GONNA GIVE MY VOTE TO THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE OF THE FEAR WHAT'S COMING OUT THE OTHER SIDE. IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO FEAR THEM GOING FORWARD, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.  -- DO YOU WANT DONALD TRUMP TO ANNOUNCE HIS CANDIDACY BEFORE THE GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFF? COULD I ACTUALLY HELP DEMOCRAT INCUMBENT RAPHAEL WARNOCK?  WELL, WE HAVE SEEN IN THIS ELECTION THAT THERE IS A DIVIDE FOR REPUBLICANS ACTUALLY REMOVE THEMSELVES FROM BEING PART OF DONALD TRUMP SHOW, AND BEING PART OF HIS COALITION. IT WASN'T WINNING FOR THEM. HONESTLY, THE CANDIDATES THAT SUPPORTED OR WERE SUPPORTED BY DONALD TRUMP, THEY DIDN'T DO THAT WELL. IT COULD ACTUALLY BE HELPFUL TO ENERGIZE OUR BASE IN GEORGIA. RAPHAEL WARNOCK DID NOT GET 50%, VERY CLOSE TO 50%. AND WE CAN OFFICIALLY CHIP OFF SOME MORE OF THESE VOTERS, IF THEY CAN SEE THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IF WE HELD HIM OFF --  SHERMICHAEL, AS WE LOOK AT THE NUMBER THREE REPUBLICAN GOP CONFERENCE SHARE, SHE'S THE FIRST MEMBER OF THE GOP LEADERSHIP TO PUBLICLY ENDORSED DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT. THAT WAS REALLY A SURPRISE TO MANY. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF HER ENDORSEMENT?  I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR A LONG TIME. -- SHE WAS A SPEECH WRITER. SHE HELPED FOCUSED ON SOME MINORITY OUTREACH. IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO SPEAKER RYAN AT THE TIME. I HAVE A GREAT AFFINITY FOR LISA.  I SENSE A BUT COMING THE.  YOU DO HEAR ABOUT. COMING BUT, I JUST THINK ALEX, WE NEED TO PLAY THIS PROCESS OUT. THIS IDEA THAT SOMEONE, WHETHER IT'S TRUMP OR ANYBODY, CAN JUST AUTOMATICALLY BE CROWNED THE NOMINEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, IS NOT FAIR TO VOTERS. GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE FOR MORE THAN ONE CANDIDATE WHO THEY WANT. I THINK A TOUGH PRIMARY PROCESS ALLOWS THE BEST OF THE WORST TO COME OUT IN AN INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS. IF IT'S TRUMP AND DESANTIS AND TWO OR THREE OTHERS IN THE FIELD, I THINK IT WILL GIVE REPUBLICAN VOTERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAY, HOW DO WE WANT TO GO? MAYBE WE DO WANT TO GO IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. -- THAT JUST WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AN ENDORSEMENT THAT I COULD HAVE MADE EARLY ON.  SHE'S PUTTING A STRANGLEHOLD ON THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AT THIS POINT. GIVE FOLKS A CHANCE. ALWAYS GOOD TO TALK TO BOTH. THANKS SO MUCH. MEANTIME, IT MAY BE THE BIGGEST DECISION OF HIS LEGAL CAREER, AND NBC HAS NEW REPORTING ON IT NEXT.

HE BEAT BLAKE MASTERS WHO IS ENDORSED BY TRUMP. THEY BECOMING THE TOP ELECTION OFFICIAL, THEY'RE BEATING REPUBLICAN MARCH FRENCH AND WHO PROMOTED CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT THE 2020 ELECTION AND MARCHED ON THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6TH. NOW BACK TO DATELINE. CK TO DATELINE DERRICK SMYER WAS OUT OF JAIL. HE INSISTED THAT HE WAS AN INNOCENT MAN, A FATHER OF TWO WHO HAD NO REASON TO COMMISSION A MURDER JUST BECAUSE HE GOT SOMEONE PREGNANT. BUT DETECTIVES WERE STILL INVESTIGATING AND WHAT THEY HEARD MADE THEM MORE CONVINCED THAN EVER THAT DEREK HAD KRYSTAL KILLED. THEY SPOKE WITH TRACEY, THE MOTHER OF DERRICK'S CHILDREN. EARLY ON IN THE CASE, SHE HAD AVOIDED THE COPS. NOW, SHE WAS EAGER TO TELL THEM WHAT SHE SAID HAPPENED IN 1998 WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH DERRICK'S FIRST CHILD.  SHE GOT LURED TO THE BACK OF HER APARTMENT ON THE PROMISE OF BEING TAKEN TO A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT BUYS MEYER. SHE WAS ASSAULTED AND HER NECK WAS CUT.  BY SOME OTHER PERSON?  BY SOME OTHER PERSON. RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL, AND SHE TOLD US THAT SHE WAS VERY LEERY BECAUSE DERRICK HAD NEVER ASKED TO TAKE HER TO THE DOCTOR BEFORE, AND INSTEAD OF TAKING HER, SHE ASKED HER TO COME TO THE REAR OF THE LAW WHERE IT IS DARKER AND THERE IS NOT MUCH ACCESS TO PUBLIC VIEW.  THERE IS THE SCAR FROM THE ATTACK AND ACCORDING TO TRACEY, IT WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.  AND THAT WAS NOT THE LAST TIME SHE WAS ASSAULTED WHILE SHE WAS PREGNANT?  NO IT WAS NOT.  TRACY TOLD POLICE THAT IN 2002 WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH THEIR SECOND CHILD SHE WAS ATTACKED AGAIN . SHE WAS KNOCKED TO THE GROUND AND THE ASSAILANT TRIED TO KICK HER IN THE STOMACH.  THAT PERSON WAS NEVER CAUGHT?  THAT'S RIGHT.  AND THE PERSON WHO QATAR THROW IN THE PREVIOUS INCIDENT WAS NEVER? CAUGHT  THAT'S CORRECT.  SHE BELIEVES DERRICK WAS BEHIND BOTH ATTACKS AND HE SAYS THAT SHE WANTED HE WANTED HER TO HAVE AN ABORTION, BUT THAT SHE REFUSED.  OUR YOU ARE PREGNANT BY ONE GUY AND YOU GET LURED TO THE BACK OF YOUR APARTMENT BUILDING, AND SOMEBODY TRIES TO KILL YOU, WHY DO YOU CONTINUE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THAT GUY?  YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND MR. DERRICK'S MYRE, AND ONE THING HE IS IS A MANIPULATOR OF WOMEN.  THE COPS SAW A PATTERN, ONE THAT WAS REINFORCED BY SOMETHING ELSE THAT THEY LEARNED.  AS THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUED, WE DISCOVERED THAT DEREK HAD BEEN TO PRESENT FOR A FEDERAL OFFENSE. HE WAS SCAMMING MONEY FROM A BANK.  IT HAPPENED IN 2000. FOR HERE IS DERRICK IN THIS FUZZY BANK SECURITY PHOTO, STEALING MONEY FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S BANK ACCOUNTS. IT TURNED OUT HE HAD A GIRLFRIEND WHO WORKED AT A CREDIT UNION, HE GOT ACCOUNT NUMBERS FROM HER AND USE THEM TO MOVE MONEY INTO ACCOUNTS THAT HE CONTROLLED.  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE $2,000 A? SCAMMED  THE INVESTIGATORS THEY DID NOT FIND ANYTHING, WE TRY TO LOOK FOR TWO, WE DO NOT FIND ANY.  YOU HEARD ABOUT DERRICK SERVING FEDERAL TIME ON THAT BANK CHARGE?  YES, I WAS NOT SURPRISED. AND I WAS NOT SURPRISED AT WHO USED AS AN ACCOMPLICE.  HIS GIRLFRIEND?  YES.  WHY WERE YOU NOT SURPRISED BY THAT?  BECAUSE DEREK POSSESSES THAT KIND OF SELFISH TYPE OF, WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR ME TYPE OF MENTALITY?  MANIPULATIVE?  MANIPULATOR, SELF CENTERED, AND ARROGANT.  MAYBE THAT IS WHY DEREK NEVER SHIED AWAY FROM TALKING WITH THE COPS AND WHY HE NEVER ASKED FOR A LAWYER. OR, MAYBE HE JUST WAS NOT GUILTY.  HE NEVER THOUGHT HE WAS SMARTER THAN WE WERE, IN A WAY. WHAT WE HAVE?  DEREK WAS BRIEFLY ARRESTED, THEY ASKED HIM WHO IS WITH ON ANDERSON PARK ON THE DAY HE WAS MURDERED.  DETECTIVES WILLIAMS THOUGHT LATER THAT IT WAS PROBABLY SEE STYLES, BUT COPS HAD NO WAY TO PROVE IT. AND THEN, UNDER QUESTIONING, DERRICK GAVE THEM ONE.  HE SAID, I SAW A WOMAN IN THE BACKSEAT.  THE BACKSEAT OF DETECTIVE WILLIAMS POLICE CAR. THE WOMAN DERRICK SAW WAS JAREN PETITO, HIS FRIEND FROM WORK WHO HAD A COMPANY DETECTIVE WILLIAMS. DERRICK SAID HE SAW HER QUITE CLEARLY.  THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS, SHE WAS TOTALLY DISTRAUGHT. THAT IS WHAT HE SAID. WHICH  WHICH GAVE DETECTIVE LOPEZ AN IDEA.  HE IS AT CLOSE TO SEE THAT HE IS TOTALLY DISTRAUGHT, AND SHE SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD LOOK AT WHO IS TALKING.  THROUGHOUT THE TIME, NO ONE AT THOUGHT TO SHOW JANET ALITO A PHOTO OF SEA STYLES. BUT NOW THEY DID. AND SHE SAID,  THAT IS WHO DERRICK IS TALKING TO IN THE PARK.  THAT IS THE MISSING LINK. A WITNESS THAT COULD CONNECT SEE STYLES TO DERRICK'S MEYER. THEN, ONE LAST PIECE. THE DA THOUGHT THEY WANTED DC STYLES INTERVIEWED AGAIN.  I AM JEANNETTE MYERS, THE DA.  THIS TIME THEY MADE SURE WHAT HE SAID COULD BE USED IN COURT.  YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT, DO YOU UNDERSTAND?  YES.  SHE STYLES TOLD THE SAME STORY WITH THE SAME DETAILS. HOW HE MET DEREK, AND HOW DEREK WANTED HELP WITH KRYSTAL TAYLOR.  YOU TALK ABOUT WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO KILL HER BUT --  I TOLD HIM ASAP. AS SOON AS I GET THE OPPORTUNITY.  DEREK ONCE AGAIN ARRESTED DERRICK SMYER FOR THE MURDER OF KRYSTAL TAYLOR, AND THIS TIME THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD THE GOODS. A JURY, THOUGH, WOULD HAVE OTHER IDEAS. COMING UP A BOMBSHELL FROM THE DEFENSE. DID SOMEONE ELSE KILL KRYSTAL?  WITNESSES TESTIFIED TO HEARING HIM ARGUING THAT SHE WAS CONFRONTING HER KILLER.  THAT IS WHEN SHE WAS SHOT?  ABSOLUTELY.

DNA, BLOOD, IN THIS CASE MONEY TRANSFER, IN THIS CASE LACK OF CELL PHONE RECORDS ATTACHING HIM TO DEFENDANTS TOGETHER.

IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.  CALVIN SCHNEIDER WAS DEREK SMYER'S DEFENSE ATTORNEY. HE SAYS SHE STYLES MADE UP A STORY THAT COPS WANTED TO HEAR. HE WAS HOPING TO GET BETTER TREATMENT IN PRISON.  HE CAME IN AND ADMITTED THAT THEY MADE THESE OFFERS TO HIM AND THAT THAT IS WHY HE DID IT.  YOU THINK POLICE?  ABSOLUTELY, BECAUSE THEY HAD A HUNCH, THEY WENT WITH MY CLIENT AND EXCLUDED OTHERS.  NEITHER TOLD THE JURY THAT WITHOUT SEE STYLES CONFESSION, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE LINKING DEREK TO THE MURDER.  THEY ARE ALLEGING MULTIPLE CONVERSATIONS, PLANNING WITHOUT ANY PROOF OF WHERE, WHEN, HOW. THERE ARE NO EMAILS BEFORE MORE AND SMYER. THERE ARE NO TEXT MESSAGES OR PHONE CALLS. THE DEFENSE BETRAYED DEREK WHO LOVED HIS CHILDREN, NOT ONE WHO WOULD TRY TO HAVE HIM MURDERED.  THERE IS MR. SMYER AGAIN, IN THE HOSPITAL, HOLDING HIS BABY. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS CASE THAT YOU EVALUATE HIS EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE IN THESE PHOTOS. PROUD FATHER OR KILLER? NOT  NOT ONLY WAS THERE SMYER INNOCENT OF KRYSTAL'S MURDER, SAID THE DEFENSE, MAYBE SHE STYLES WAS TO? THERE IS NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE PLACING HIM IN THAT PARKING GARAGE. MAYBE, THEY SAID, THIS WAS NOT A HIT AFTER ALL.  SEVERAL OF THE WITNESSES TESTIFIED TO HEARING A ARGUMENT AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, THE ARGUMENT ENDED AND THERE IS A PAUSE, A GUNSHOT, AND IT WAS ABSOLUTELY INCONSISTENT WITH A HIRED HIT.  IF NOT A HIT, THEN WHAT HAPPENED?  THE DEFENSE HAD A THEORY. IT INVOLVED A PHOTO OF CHRISTIAN SON JAVANTE FOUND NEAR HER BODY.  IT IS OBVIOUS THAT MISS TAYLOR WAS HOLDING THAT PICTURE WHEN SHE GOT SHOT.  SCHNEIDER WAS NOT ALLOWED TO DIRECTLY SPELL OUT HIS THEORY FOR THE JURY, BUT HE DID FOR US.  I THINK SHE WAS CONFRONTING HER KILLER SAYING, THE ONLY THING YOU ARE GOING TO SEE IS A PHOTOGRAPH OF YOUR SON UNTIL YOU PAY CHILD SUPPORT.  AND YOU THINK THAT IS WHAT YOU? SHOT  ABSOLUTELY. THE  THE DEFENSE SUGGESTED JAVANTE'S FATHER KILLED CRYSTAL, NEVER MIND THAT POLICE HAD CLEARED HIM EARLY ON.  THERE IS LAWYER TOLD THE JURY THAT THEIR CLIENT WAS AN INNOCENT MAN.  THIS TRAGEDY WOULD BE COMPOUNDED IF YOU CONVICT A PERSON THAT IS NOT INVOLVED.  AND I AM ASKING FOR A NOT GUILTY VERDICT ON ALL COUNTS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  KRYSTAL'S FAMILY WORRIED THAT THEY CAN ONLY HOPE THAT THE JURY BELIEVED STYLES CONFESSION AND NOT HIS RECANT ASIAN OF IT. THE AWAIT FOR A VERDICT WAS AGONIZING.  THAT WAS PAINFUL.  ONE DAY PASSED, THEN TWO, THREE DAYS IN.  I AM NERVOUS, I DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS AGAIN. I CANNOT DO THIS AGAIN. IT IS NOT EASY.  THEN, IT WAS A WEEK, THEN ONE WEEK TURNED INTO TWO.  I'M JUST PRAYING, NO MATTER WHAT I SEE HERE OR, I JUST KEEP CRYING.  EVERY DAY, THE WAITING WAS HARDER. THAT WAS TRUE FOR DERRICK'S FAMILY TO.  I STARTED GETTING NERVOUS, THERE EVERY DAY, ANXIOUSLY WAITING  I WOULD SEE THE JURORS COME OUT OF THEIR, RIGHT IN THE FACE, ALMOST LIKE THEY ARE ARGUING BACK THERE.  LIKE I HAD BEEN? YELLING  LIKE THEY'D BEEN YELLING.  WE HAVE A RECORD --  AFTER 21 DAYS, THE JURY REASSEMBLE IN THE COURTROOM.  THE JURY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO REACH A VERDICT.  THEY WERE STUCK.  I DO DECLARE A MISTRIAL.  THIS IS BREAKING ME. I HOPE BY THE TIME THEY DO IT AGAIN, THEY PULL IT BACK TOGETHER. BUT TODAY I DO NOT WANT TO DO IT AGAIN.  COMING UP, TRIAL NUMBER TWO. THIS TIME, NEW EVIDENCE. AND, A NEW WITNESS.  WHEN PEOPLE WERE AROUND HE WOULD BEHAVE A CERTAIN WAY.  THERE IS OWN DAUGHTER, WHAT WOULD SHE REVEAL? WHEN DATELINE CONTINUES. WHEN DATELINE CONTINUES. ABOUT EXCITING MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS THAT CAN PROVIDE BROAD COVERAGE AND STILL MAY SAVE YOU MONEY ON MONTHLY PREMIUMS AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WITH ORIGINAL MEDICARE YOU ARE COVERED FOR HOSPITAL STAYS AND DOCTOR OFFICE VISITS BUT YOU HAVE TO MEET A DEDUCTIBLE FOR EACH, AND THEN YOU'RE STILL RESPONSIBLE FOR 20% OF THE COST. NEXT, LET'S LOOK AT A MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PLAN. AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY COVER THE SAME THINGS AS ORIGINAL MEDICARE, AND THEY ALSO COVER YOUR MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLES AND COINSURANCE. BUT THEY OFTEN HAVE HIGHER MONTHLY PREMIUMS AND NO PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE. NOW, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HUMANA'S MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS. WITH A HUMANA MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLAN, HOSPITALS STAYS, DOCTOR OFFICE VISITS AND YOUR ORIGINAL MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLES ARE COVERED. AND, OF COURSE, MOST HUMANA MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS INCLUDE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE. WITH NO COPAYS OR DEDUCTIBLES ON TIER 1 PRESCRIPTIONS, AND ZERO DOLLARS FOR ROUTINE VACCINES, INCLUDING SHINGLES, AT IN-NETWORK RETAIL PHARMACIES. IN FACT, IN 2021, HUMANA MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRESCRIPTION DRUG PLAN MEMBERS SAVED AN ESTIMATED $9,600 ON AVERAGE ON THEIR PRESCRIPTION COSTS. MOST HUMANA MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS HAVE COVERAGE FOR VISION AND HEARING. AND DENTAL COVERAGE THAT INCLUDES TWO FREE CLEANINGS A YEAR, PLUS DENTURES, CROWNS, FILLINGS AND MORE! MOST HUMANA MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS INCLUDE A SILVER SNEAKERS FITNESS PROGRAM AT NO EXTRA COST. YOU GET ALL OF THIS FOR AS LOW AS A ZERO-DOLLAR MONTHLY PLAN PREMIUM IN MANY AREAS; AND YOUR DOCTOR AND HOSPITAL MAY ALREADY BE A PART OF HUMANA'S LARGE NETWORK. THERE IS NO OBLIGATION, SO CALL THE NUMBER ON YOUR SCREEN RIGHT NOW TO SEE IF YOUR DOCTOR IS IN OUR NETWORK; TO FIND OUT IF YOU COULD SAVE ON YOUR PRESCRIPTIONS, AND TO GET OUR FREE DECISION GUIDE. HUMANA, A MORE HUMAN WAY TO HEALTHCARE. THE IT WAS LIKE THEIR OWN NIGHTMARISH GROUNDHOG DAY. BUT NEARLY NINE MONTHS AFTER THE MISTRIAL, CRYSTAL TAYLOR'S FAMILY ENTERED A COURTHOUSE, WONDERING IF THIS TIME JUSTICE WOULD FINALLY BE SERVED?  ARE YOU FEELING ANY BETTER ABOUT THE SECOND TRIAL, THAT YOU WERE ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST? TRIAL  I WAS, BECAUSE WE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT. WE KNEW WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO SAY, AND WE KNEW IT WE HAD.  AND WHAT YOU DIDN'T? HAVE  RIGHT. WE HOPE THAT WHATEVER MISTAKES WERE MADE FROM THE FIRST TRIAL, WE WERE PREPARED AND WOULD DO BETTER.  TWO BIG DIFFERENCES THIS TIME AROUND. FIRST, SKYLER MOORE, A CASEY STYLES WAS ON TRIAL ALONG WITH DEREK, ALTHOUGH EACH DEFENDANT HAD THEIR OWN DEFENDANT. AND THEY WOULD NOT SEE C-STYLES VIDEOTAPED CONFESSION. SO PROSECUTORS FOCUSED ON DERRICK'S MOTIVE. HERE IS A MAN, THEY TOLD THE JURY, WHO WOULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING TO AVOID PAYING CHILD SUPPORT.  KRYSTAL AND HER FIVE MONTH UNBORN CHILD WERE KILLED WITH ONE GUNSHOT. ONE GUNSHOT, TO THE BACK OF HER HEAD.  THAT, SAID THE PROSECUTION, FIT THE PATTERN. THEY CALLED DERRICK'S OLD GIRLFRIEND TRACY WILLIAMSON, WHO REPEATED HER STORY THAT THE FIRST TIME SHE WAS PREGNANT SHE WAS ATTACKED BY A MAN SHE DIDN'T. NO  HE PUT A KNIFE TO MY THROAT.  DID HE CUT YOU WITH AN? I'VE  YES.  AND THEN, DURING HER SECOND PREGNANCY, A SECOND ATTACK.  SOMEBODY CAME AND SLAPPED ME IN THE FACE. I WENT ON THE SIDE OF THE CAR, AND SOMEBODY STOMPED ME ON MY STOMACH AND MY FACE.  THEN, DERRICK'S OWN DAUGHTER TOOK THE STAND AGAINST HIM. SHE DID NOT TESTIFY IN THE FIRST TRIAL, BUT SHE TOLD THIS JURY THAT DEREK SEEMED TO HATE BEING A FATHER.  HE WOULD CALM DURING MAJOR OCCASIONS, BIRTHDAYS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. HE WAS VERY ILL TEMPERED. HE DID NOT SPEND MUCH TIME WITH ME, AND WHEN IT DID IT JUST SEEMED LIKE IT WAS FOR SHOW. IF PEOPLE WERE AROUND, HE WOULD BEHAVE A CERTAIN WAY, AND WHEN THOSE PEOPLE LEFT HE WOULD GO BACK TO HIS ILL TEMPER DENNIS AND HIS KIND OF, MONSTERS WAYS.  TO HELP EXPLAIN HOW DEREK HAD KRYSTAL KILLED, PROSECUTORS AGAIN CALLED HER SISTER MICHELLE WHO HAD BEEN THROUGH THE EMOTIONAL RINGER WHEN SHE TESTIFIED AT THE FIRST TRIAL.  I WAS AFRAID OF WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO TO ME, MENTALLY, THE SECOND TIME. I WAS AFRAID FOR MYSELF.  NOW THEY'RE THE LAST, MICHELLE MUSTER THE COURAGE TO TAKE THE STAND AND TESTIFY TO SEEING THE ALLEGED GUNMAN C-STYLES IN THEIR APARTMENT COMPLEX TODAY BEFORE HER SISTER'S MURDER.  I TOLD HIM THAT HE STARTLED ME, AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS DOING THERE.  THE JURY ALSO HEARD FROM CHAUVIN A HALL, IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AT THE TIME, NOW AN ADULT WHO SAID SHE STILL REMEMBERS SEEING C-STYLES FLEEING THE CRIME SCENE.  WHAT DID YOU HEAR?  IT WAS LIKE A GUNSHOT. LIKE A BIG NOISE, BASICALLY.  WHAT NEXT OCCURRED?  WE SEE SOMEBODY RUNNING PAST US.  PROSECUTORS THEN HAD TO CONNECT C-STYLES WITH DEREK SMYER. FOR THAT THEY RELY ON TO EYEWITNESSES.  DETECTIVE WILLIAMS TOLD THE JURY THAT HE WAS PRETTY SURE C-STYLES WAS WITH DEREK AT THE PARK ON THE DAY CRYSTAL TYLOR WAS AMBUSHED AND MURDERED.  IT WAS NOT UNTIL YOU SAW HIM IN PERSON THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO REMEMBER THAT HE RESEMBLED THE PERSON YOU SAW THE PARK?  YES.  AS BEFORE, CRYSTALS FRIEND AND COWORKER, JANET LEFT NO DOUBT WITH HER DEFINITIVE TESTIMONY.  AS YOU SIT HERE TODAY, DID YOU SEE BOTH OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THE PARK?  YES?  GIANNA ALSO TOLD THE JURORS THAT WELL KRYSTAL WAS EXCITED TO HAVE ANOTHER SON, SHE WAS AFRAID TO TELL DEREK SHE WAS PREGNANT, SO JANET TOLD HIM FOR HER VIA EMAIL.  AFTER YOU SENT THE EMAIL TO DEREK SMYER, DID YOU GET A PHONE CALL?  YES I DID.  IT WAS DEREK SMYER AND HE WAS NOT HAPPY. BUT  HE DID NOT WANT NO KIDS,. HE DID NOT WANDER TO HAVE THE BABY.  DID HE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT TRYING TO DO SOMETHING WITH? KRYSTAL  HE JUST SAID IF I CAN GET HER TO GET RID OF THE BABY, HE CAN. BUT HE DOES NOT WANT TO HAVE A BABY.  AND GIANNA RECALLED THE DAY BEFORE KRYSTAL WAS MURDERED, HER FIRST DAY BACK AT WORK, DERRICK CALLED AGAIN.  COULD YOU HEAR ANYTHING WITH RESPECT TO THE CONVERSATION SHE WAS HAVING?  NO, THE ONLY THING I HEARD WAS BEFORE SHE HUNG UP THE PHONE SHE WAS LIKE, WHATEVER. BECAUSE SHE WAS CRYING, SHE WAS LIKE WHATEVER. SHE GOT IT FROM HER DESK.  WHEN SHE GOT UP FROM HER DESK, DID YOU SEE WHERE SHE? WENT  SHE WENT TO THE BATHROOM.  AND WHEN YOU FOLLOWED HER IN THE BATHROOM WHAT WAS SHE DOING?  CRYING.  THEN DETECTIVE BETH SMITH TESTIFIED ABOUT TWO KEY PIECES OF EVIDENCE, THAT THE FIRST JURY NEVER SAW. FIRST THE PHOTO OF DEREK ON THE HIGH SCHOOL BACK SPOIL TEEN, PROVING THAT HE DID PLAY BASKETBALL. AN IMPORTANT DETAIL BECAUSE POLICE BELIEVED DEREK MET SKYLER MORE ON THE BASKETBALL COURT. THE SECOND NEW PIECE OF EVIDENCE WAS SECURITY FOOTAGE FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE KRYSTAL'S MURDER. A PLACE DERRICK AT THE 7:11 NEAR KRYSTAL TAYLOR'S HOME, AND SKYLER MOORS. IT PROVED, THEY SAID, THAT DEREK HAD LIED ABOUT ITS WHEREABOUTS IN 2001. WHERE HE TOLD POLICE THAT HE WAS MILES FROM CRYSTALS HAWTHORNE, HOME AT NIGHT.  DID HE EVER TELL YOU THAT HE WENT TO THE SAME 11?  NO.  AS THE EVIDENCE WAS MOUNTING AGAINST HIM, DEREK'S DEFENSE WENT ON OFFENSE, PORTRAYING THE MOTHER AS HIS TWO CHILDREN AS A LIAR WHOSE TESTIMONY COULD NOT BE TRUSTED.  HAVE YOU LIED TO YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS LIKE YOUR AUNT, SISTER DANIELLE, ABOUT THINGS ABOUT MR. SMYER?  I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE, YOU HAVE TO BE SPECIFIC.  LIED FURIOUS? PEOPLE LIE ALL THE TIME. YOU LIE.  TRACY WILLIAMSON WAS AN ADMITTED LIAR, AND UNTRUTHFUL. SO YOU COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT SHE. SAID  AS FOR KRYSTAL'S FRIEND GIANNA, WHO SAID THAT SHE SAW C-STYLES AND DEREK SMYER TOGETHER.  THE DEFENSE SAYS DERRICK WAS WITH A HIGH SCHOOL FRIEND, AND ERIC SISTER DANIELLE SAID DEREK MATA GANGBANGERS ON THE BASKETBALL COURT IS ABSURD. BUT HE GREW UP PLAYING BASKETBALL IN A BUNCH OF OTHER SCORE. DID HE PLAY IN HIGH? SCHOOL  HE DID IN HIGH SCHOOL, HE PLAYED HIGH SCHOOL UP UNTIL'S JUNIOR. HAVE NOT TOUCHED A BASKETBALL, SINCE DERRICK'S NOT PLAY BASKETBALL.  IN THIS COURT, EVERYTHING WAS ON THE LINE. THAT IS WHEN DIRE DERRICK'S MEYER NEVER SHIED AWAY FROM EXPLAINING HIMSELF IN THE PAST, TOOK THE STAND. I COMING UP, DERRICK BUT A DUTIFUL DAD TO BE?  I WAS PREPARED TO TAKE CARE OF MY RESPONSIBILITY. WHEN DATELINE CONTINUES. INE CONTINUES. IT IS A CALCULATED RISK FOR A DEFENDANT TO TESTIFY AT A TRIAL. DERRICK SMYER WAS WILLING TO TAKE IT. PROSECUTORS HAD PAINTED HIM AS A CHILD HATING, COLD BLOODED KILLER. DEREK AND HIS ATTORNEY WERE DETERMINED TO SHOW HE WAS ANYTHING BUT.  DO YOU RECALL THE BIRTH OF YOUR DAUGHTER'S?  YES I DO.  WHAT WAS THE DATE?  IT WAS TODAY, ACTUALLY. APRIL 26, 1998.  AND YOU ARE THERE FOR THE BIRTH, CORRECT?  OF COURSE.  DERRICK TOLD THE JURY THAT HE WAS A LOVING AND DEVOTED FATHER TO HIS TWO GIRLS.  HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR RELATIONSHIP?  WHILE THEY WERE GROWING UP IT WAS STRONG, IN MY OPINION.  AND HE WAS ADAMANT THAT HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ATTACKS ON TREY SEWELL SHE WAS PREGNANT.  DID YOU EVER ATTACK IT BECAUSE HE WANTED THE KID KILLED, YOU WANTED HER TO HAVE AN ABORTION?  NO, I DID NOT. IN FACT THAT POINTED ALREADY DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL, I WAS WORKING, I WAS BUYING BOTTLES, OTHERS INVESTED IN THE WELL-BEING OF MY DAUGHTER.  DERRICK TOLD THE JURY THAT HE WAS A GOOD DAD TO HIS CHILDREN WITH, TRACY AND PLAN TO TREAT KRYSTAL AND THEIR CHILD THE SAME WAY.  WERE YOU ANGRY THAT MISS TAYLOR WAS GOING TO KEEP THIS CHILD?  NO SIR.  WAS NOT THIS GOING TO RUIN YOUR? LIFE  OR ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT HAVING TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT FOR 18 YEARS?  NO SIR.  WHY NOT?  I WAS PREPARED TO TAKE CARE OF MY RESPONSIBILITY.  HE ADMITTED HE DID CALL CRYSTAL LEADING UP TO HER DEATH, BUT DERRICK SAID IT WAS JUST TO CHECK IN ON HER AS ANY GOOD SOON TO BE FATHER WOULD.  I ASKED HOW SHE WAS FEELING.  WHY DID YOU ASK THAT?  BECAUSE I KNOW BEFORE SHE WAS HAVING MORNING SICKNESS.  DEREK MAKE SURE TO LET JURORS KNOW THAT HE, LIKE CRYSTALS FAMILY, WITH --  HOW LONG DID YOU WORK AT BOUNTY?  UNTIL ABOUT TWO WEEKS AFTER WE LOST KRYSTAL.  KRYSTAL'S FAMILY HEARD THAT AND SEIZED.  IT BOTHERED ME SO MUCH TO HEAR HIM SAY THAT BECAUSE HE NEVER CALLED, HE NEVER CARED, HE DOES NOT CARE.  AS FOR THE PROSECUTOR THEORY THAT HE HAD JUST A PLOT ON THE BASKETBALL COURT WITH SKYLER MOORE, AKA C-STYLES TO KILL CRYSTAL TAYLOR. IMPOSSIBLE, SAID DEREK. FOR TWO REASONS.  DID YOU EVER PLAY BASKETBALL?  BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY.  PRIOR TO THIS CASE, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SKYLER MORE IN YOUR LIFE?  DEREK ALSO HAD AN EXPLANATION AS TO WHY HE SHOWED UP IN SECURITY VIDEO AT A 7:11 NEAR BOTH THEIR HOMES. HE SAID HE STOPPED FOR CASH BEING AT HIS AUNTS HOUSE NEARBY.  MY MOTHER ASKED MY MOM TO TAKE A COOKING DEVICE. IT WAS SOMETHING ROUND, EITHER CROCK-POT OR A PRESSURE COOKER.  HE DENIED ANY INVOLVEMENT IN KRYSTAL'S MURDER.  DID YOU HAVE HER KILLED? DID YOU HAVE A SHOT IN THE HEAD SO SHE COULD NOT GIVE BIRTH TO YOUR BABY?   NO I DID NOT.  NOTHING FURTHER.  BUT DERRICK WAS NOT DONE ON THE STAND. NOW CAME THE RISKY PART. CROSS-EXAMINATION BY A PROSECUTOR, DETERMINED TO SHOW THE OTHER SIDE OF ERIK SMYER.  WHY DID YOU ASK HER TO GET A PATERNITY? TEST  BECAUSE I WAS BEING RESPONSIBLE.  I SEE. BUT WOULDN'T BEING RESPONSIBLE BEING PUTTING ON A CONDOM?  IRRELEVANT.  THE PROSECUTOR FORCED DEREK TO ADMIT THAT HE HAD TRIED TO CONVINCE CRYSTAL TO TERMINATE HER PREGNANCY.  DID YOU TELL HER TO GET AN ABORTION?  NOT DIRECTLY, NO.  SO INDIRECTLY YOU TOLD HER TO GET AN ABORTION?  YES MA'AM.  FOR ALL THIS TALK ABOUT LOSING KRYSTAL, THE PROSECUTOR POINTED OUT THAT HE NEVER ONCE TRIED TO CONSOLE HER FAMILY.  DID YOU SEND FLOWERS TO THE FAMILY WHEN SHE DIED?  DID YOU SEND THE FAMILY A CARD, A SYMPATHY CARD WHEN SHE WAS MURDERED?  NO MA'AM.  ALL OF IT WAS AN ATTEMPT TO SHOW THE JURY THAT THE CALM, SOFTSPOKEN DEREK SPEIER ON THE STAND WAS A CON. THE REAL DERIC WAS AN UNREPENTANT CRIMINAL, AMUSED BY THE FAILED ATTEMPT AT BANK FRAUD.  I DID NOT GET MY CAUGHT.  AND YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY, DON'T YOU?  NO, I AM EMBARRASSED BY WHICH, IS WHY I PAUSED. I AM VERY EMBARRASSED ABOUT, IF I WANT TO TELL THE TRUTH.  THAT SMILE ON YOUR FACES SOMETHING. ELLIS  AS FARGO INTO STANCE THAN I BEFORE THE MURDER TO DELIVER A CROCK POT. THE PROSECUTION LET DERRICK KNOW THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A CROCK OF SOMETHING ELSE.  YOU DID NOT TALK ABOUT A TRIP TO YEAR ON DID YOU?  NO MA'AM.  MAYBE HE WAS, ARROGANT SMOG, AND TOO FAMILIAR WITH THE RULES OF THE LAW.  DEREK, YOU DID NOT ONE ANOTHER CHILD. IF SHE HAD HAD THAT BABY HE WOULD'VE HAD TO SUPPORT TWO KIDS IN 2000. FOR RIGHT?  I'M SORRY, I BELIEVE THAT IS COMPOUND.  I DO NOT KNOW WHICH ONES TO WORRY ABOUT.  HE TRIED TO WHO THE JURY OVER LIKE HE KNEW THE LAW.  HE WAS SO IMPRESSED WITH HIMSELF.  HE WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH HIMSELF.  IT ALMOST --  THEN, ONCE AGAIN, DEREK'S FATE WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE JURY.  WHICH DEREK WHAT THEY BELIEVE WAS THE REAL ONE? THIS TIME CRYSTAL'S FAMILY DID NOT HAVE TO WAIT NEARLY AS LONG FOR A DECISION. DELIBERATIONS TOOK BARELY MORE THAN A DAY.  THEY BROUGHT THE JURY IN.  HOW DOES DERRICK LOOK?  HE LOOKS COCKY AND ARROGANT, LIKE HE BELIEVES HE IS GOING TO GET A NOT GUILTY VERDICT.  WE THE JURY FIND THE DEFENDANT, DEREK PAUL'S MEYER, GUILTY OF THE CRIME OF MURDER.  I'VE GOT TO RUN OUT OF THERE BECAUSE I CANNOT EVEN HOLD AN EMOTION. I WANT TO SCREAM BY THE END. I WAS SO HAPPY, I WAS SO HAPPY. I WAS MORE HAPPY THAN I HAD EVER BEEN IN MY LIFE.  ACROSS THE AISLE, A DIFFERENT EMOTION.  THEY READ THAT GUILTY VERDICT AND IT IS LIKE TIME FROZE. I WAS IN SHOCK. HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN?  OUTSIDE THE COURTROOM, A GESTURE FROM THE OPPOSING SIDE CAUGHT DANIELLE OFF-GUARD.  MICHELLE CAME UP TO ME IN THAT HALLWAY, I HAD NOT SHED ANY TEARS BECAUSE I TRIED TO CONTAIN MY EMOTION, AND SHE HUGGED ME, AND SHE SAID SHE WAS SORRY. AND I BURST INTO TEARS. I BURST INTO TEARS BECAUSE THAT, TO ME, IS A TRUE EXAMPLE OF HUMANITY. REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE HAVE GONE THROUGH, AND OUR FAMILIES HAVE BOTH GONE THROUGH A LOT, LOST A LOT, CONTINUING TO GRIEVE, BUT I APPRECIATED THE HUMANITY THAT SHE SHOWED.  DERRICK SMYER WAS SENTENCED TO LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE. C-STYLES WAS ALSO CONVICTED IN CRYSTALS MURDER AND RECEIVE TWO LIFE SENTENCES, ALSO WITHOUT PAROLE, TO BECAUSE SERVED CONSECUTIVELY. KRYSTAL'S SON JAVANTE HAS RECONNECTED WITH HIS DAD, BUT STILL HURTS FROM THE LOSS OF HIS MOM.  I'M ALWAYS GOING TO MISS HER, BUT I DO NOT THINK SHE WOULD WANT ME TO LINGER, TO LET IT HOLD ME BACK. EVERYTHING THAT IS HAPPENED.  SHE WOULD NOT WANT YOU TO BE? MISERABLE  YES.  EASIER SAID THAN DONE, SOMETIMES.  THAT IS TRUE, BUT I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE TO HELP ME. GOOD FAMILY, GOOD FRIENDS.  KRYSTAL'S FAMILY, ONE SPLINTERED, NOW FEEL THEY ARE COMING TOGETHER AGAIN. IT IS NOT THE SAME AS WHEN KRYSTAL WAS WITH SOME, BUT IT IS SLOWLY GETTING BETTER AND THEY HAVE A PLEA FOR OTHER POTENTIAL CRYSTAL TAILORS OUT THERE.  NOTHING CAN BRING CHRISSY BACK. THIS WILL NOT FADE HER, IT W END|20221112095955|2022-11-12_0800_US_MSNBC_Dateline ",

        "trs": " THE BIG BREAKING NEWS OF THIS HOUR IS FROM ARIZONA. NBC IS PROJECTING TWO IMPORTANT WINS IN ARIZONA FOR THE DEMOCRATS. DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MARK KELLY IS PROJECTED TO BE THE WINNER IN HIS REELECTION CAMPAIGN OVER BLAKE MASTERS, DONALD TRUMP'S CHOSEN CANDIDATE FOR SENATE IN ARIZONA. SENATOR KELLY WON OVER THE TOP WITH SOME NUMBERS FROM MARICOPA COUNTY THAT WERE DELIVERED TONIGHT. ALSO, THERE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT, IF NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT SECRETARY OF STATE RACE IN THE COUNTRY. SECRETARY OF STATE OF ARIZONA. NBC'S PROJECTING ADRIAN FONTES, AS THE WINNER OF THAT RACE, OVER MARK FINCHEM, WHO IS AN ELECTION DENIER, WHO HAS ALL BUT PROMISED TO CORRUPT FUTURE ELECTIONS IN ARIZONA, IF HE HAD BEEN ELECTED, AGAIN. NBC'S PROJECTING SECRETARY OF STATE-ELECT ADRIAN FONTES IN ARIZONA, AND JOINING US NOW IS ARIZONA'S SECRETARY OF STATE -ELECT, ADRIAN FONTES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US ON THIS IMPORTANT NIGHT. IT WAS, IT TOOK A FEW DAYS TO GET HERE, BUT THIS IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT VICTORIES IN ANY OF THESE ELECTIONS THAT WE SEE ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY. TELL US WHAT WAS AT STAKE IN THIS CAMPAIGN, IN ARIZONA. IS THIS THE CAMPAIGN, OR ONE OF THEM, THAT PRESIDENT BIDEN MEANT WHEN HE SAID, DEMOCRACIES ON THE BALLOT?  THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION. THE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED CANDIDATES IN THIS RACE, MR. FINCHEM, AND BOTH CAPER, AN ANTISEMITE, AN ELECTION DENIER, AND MYSELF. I'M AN HARD-CORE VETERAN, AND ELECTION ADMINISTRATOR, WITH A GUY WHO BEAT THE CYBER NINJAS HERE IN MARICOPA COUNTY. WE ADVOCATED FOR OUR TEAM, THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY RUN ELECTIONS. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, AND INDEPENDENTS ALIKE. REGULAR CITIZENS WHO HAVE BEEN COLORING, WHO HAVE BEEN INSULTED, WHO HAVE BEEN CALLED FRAUDS AND CHEATS BY THESE ELECTION DENIERS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS HAVE HAD THEIR WE -- ARE VERY EXCITED THAT THE VOTERS IN ARIZONA RECOGNIZE THE NONSENSE THAT THEY PRESENTED, AND IT LOOKS LIKE VOTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE PUSHING BACK HARD AGAINST THIS BIG LIE, AND I'M JUST VERY PROUD TO BE ONE OF THE FOLKS CARRYING THAT STANDARD FORWARD, AND I'M VERY EXCITED. THIS IS JUST A MEDIA CALL. WE'RE GONNA RESPECT THE PROCESS, WHICH IS THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO.  YOU KNOW, WHEN I LOOK AT THE EGGS OF BOWLING OF ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO ARIZONA VOTERS, INFLATION IS AT THE TOP BY FAR, CRIME IS IN THERE ON THE LIST, DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST. BUT MOST OF THESE ISSUES, ABORTION, THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE JOB OF SECRETARY OF STATE. SO, WHAT DID YOU FIND TO BE OF CONCERN TO VOTERS IN THE JOB OF SECRETARY OF STATE?  WELL, THE ISSUE WAS WHETHER OR NOT THEY'LL BE ABLE TO VOTE IN THE FUTURE. LOOK, THESE FOLKS WILL BE WANTED TO STOP REGULAR AMERICANS FROM VOTING. MY OPPONENT HAD ACTUALLY SPONSORED A BILL TO TAKE THIS ELECTION TO THE U.S. SENATE. U.S. SENATORS AWAY FROM THE VOTERS IN 2018, BEFORE THE BIG LIE STARTED. THIS IS AN AUTHORITARIAN VIEW OF WHAT AMERICA SHOULD LOOK LIKE. IT'S FASCISM AT THE END OF THE DAY, WHEN YOU LOOK AT ALL THE REST OF THE FACTORS. AND THAT HAS BEEN STRUGGLING REJECTED. WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT HAVING REPRESENTATIVE WELL REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS, AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE. REMEMBER, ARIZONA ONLY HAS ABOUT 32% OF OUR VOTERS WHO ARE REGISTERED DEMOCRATS. WE HAD A BROAD COALITION ACROSS ALL PARTY LINES OF FOLKS WHO WANTED US TO HELP PROTECT DEMOCRACY. THEY SAW THIS CAMPAIGN AS THE TIP OF THE SPEAR NOT JUST IN ARIZONA BUT NATIONALLY. AND AGAIN, I WAS VERY PROUD TO HAVE HAD THAT SUPPORT ACROSS PARTY SUPPORT, AND THE VOTERS KNEW WHAT WAS AT STAKE. I THINK A LOT OF TIMES POLITICIANS AND PUNDITS DON'T GIVE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC THE CREDIT THEY DESERVE FOR KNOWING WHAT'S AT STAKE. THIS TIME, THE AMERICAN PUBLIC CAME THROUGH, AND I AM VERY, VERY EXCITED FOR THE OFFICIAL CALL WHICH WILL PROBABLY HAPPEN IN SEVEN DAYS FROM NOW.  KATIE HOBBS, THE CURRENT SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR, HAS SUFFERED DEATH THREATS CONSTANTLY SINCE THE VOTE COUNTING STARTED IN THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, AND THOSE DEATHS HAVE CONTINUED ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THIS TIME. WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO RUN FOR AND, AN OFFICE WHERE YOU KNOW THAT IN THE CURRENT CLIMATE, DEATH THREATS ARE PART OF THE JOB?  WELL, WE ALSO SUFFERED THOSE KINDS OF DEATH THREATS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, I WAS ON CAPITOL HILL TESTIFYING WITH OTHER ELECTION ADMINISTRATORS. THIS IS A DISEASE THAT HAS PLAGUED ELECTION ADMINISTRATORS ACROSS THE NIGHT STATES. SO, IN AMERICA, IT'S WRONGHEADED, IT'S ANTI-AMERICAN, IT'S FUELED BY THE BIG LIE. AND THE AMERICAN VOTERS, I THINK, WITHOUT ONLY SAID, THAT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE ANYMORE. WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THIS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE THIS PURELY CIVILIAN EXERCISE BE A CIVILIAN EXERCISE. IT'S GONNA BE RUN BY MATURE LEVELHEADED REASONABLE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT DIFFER IN VARIOUS OTHER POLICIES. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO VOTING, WHEN IT COMES TO ACTIONS AT THE BALLOT BOX, WE NEED NOT TO ACT LIKE MONSTERS OR CHILDREN, OR CHILD THIS, CHILDISH MONSTERS, WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE SEEN. WE NEED TO ACT LIKE GROWN-UPS, AND THANKFULLY, IT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S WHO'S GONNA BE IN CHARGE OF ELECTIONS IN ARIZONA AND NEVADA, AND SEVERAL OTHER STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE NATION WILL LOOK TO BE THE SAME, SORT OF, POSITION THAT I AM IN. AND I'M EXCITED TO GET TO WORK TO MAKE SURE WE RESTORE THE CONFIDENCE, THAT WAS LOST, IN SYSTEMS THAT WERE PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE, PERFECTLY WELL RUN, AND A BUNCH OF BRUISES HERE AND THERE. BUT THE END OF THE DAY, WE'RE ALL HUMAN BEINGS. WE NEED TO DO WELL TOGETHER AS AMERICANS WHEN WE ACT LIKE AS AMERICANS. AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT PIECE HERE.  ARIZONA SECRETARY OF STATE-ELECT ADRIAN FONTES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US FOR YOUR FIRST INTERVIEW AFTER YOUR VICTORY HAS BEEN PROJECTED IN ARIZONA AND THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING THE FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY IN THIS ELECTION, AND WINNING IT IN YOUR CASE. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WIN AND THE WIN FOR DEMOCRACY THAT YOUR ELECTION REPRESENTS.  THANK YOU, SIR.  THANK YOU. AND AS WE AWAIT THE FINAL VOTE COUNT IN NEVADA, GEORGIA, ONCE AGAIN, COULD DETERMINE WHICH PARTY SECURES CONTROL OF THE SENATE. DEMOCRATIC SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK WILL FACE DONALD TRUMP'S REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, HERSCHEL WALKER, AND ONE OF ELECTION ON DECEMBER 6TH. SENATOR WARNOCK LET HERSCHEL WALKER BY MORE THAN 35,000 VOTES IN THE GENERAL ELECTION, BUT DID NOT REACH THE 50% THRESHOLD REQUIRED TO WIN THAT RACE OUTRIGHT. JOINING US NOW IS GEORGIA CONGRESSWOMAN. SHE WON REELECTION IN GEORGIA'S FIFTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, AND IS THE CHAIR OF THE GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY. SO, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US AGAIN TONIGHT. CONGRESSWOMAN WE WILLIAMS, SORRY, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE A VACATION BREAK COMING UP.  NO REST CHILD THIS FOR THE WORRY, LAWRENCE BUT WE'RE READY TO GET BACK UP THERE BECAUSE OUR VOTERS ARE EAGER TO SEND OUR SENATOR BACK TO WASHINGTON, TO CONTINUE DELIVER FOR THE REST OF PEOPLE OF GEORGIA. WE'RE EXCITED.  WHAT IS IT GONNA MEAN TO THE CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA, IF NEVADA DECIDES THIS, AND WE ELECT THEIR DEMOCRATIC SENATOR SO THAT CONTROL OF THE SENATE IS ALREADY GUARANTEED TO THE DEMOCRATS AND THAT SENATOR WARNOCK WILL SIMPLY REPRESENT THE 51ST VOTE?  LAWRENCE, AS WE ARE OUT TALKING TO VOTERS, THEY'RE NOT ASKING ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON. WHAT THEY WANTED IS SOMEONE WHO DELIVER FOR THEM EVERY DAY RIGHT HERE IN GEORGIA. SO, WE'RE TALKING TO GEORGIA VOTERS ABOUT ISSUES THAT MATTER TO THEM EVERY DAY. AND ULTIMATELY, LAWRENCE, THIS RAISES ABOUT COMPETENCE AND CHARACTER. AND I THINK WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO THOSE TWO, THE CHOICE IS CLEAR IN THIS ELECTION, WHETHER IT IS FOR THE 50TH BOTH OR THE 51ST VOTE, WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WHEN WE PUT SENATOR WARNOCK'S COMPETENCE AND CHARACTER ON THE BALLOT AGAINST HERSCHEL WALKER, WE WIN EVERY TIME.  HOW ARE VOTERS DEALING WITH THE ISSUES THAT REPRESENT -- EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS IN THE EXIT POLLS LIKE INFLATION AND OTHER ISSUES, AS THEY VOTE FOR SENATOR WARNOCK. WHAT IS IT THAT THEY ARE EXPECTING OF HIM THAT THEY DON'T EXPECT THE REPUBLICANS CAN DELIVER?  SO, LAWRENCE, SENATOR WARNOCK HAS BEEN IN OFFICE FOR TWO YEARS NOW. AND HE'S BEEN OUT IN THE COMMUNITY, TALKING TO GEORGIANS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE. AND WHAT GEORGIA VOTERS KNOW IS THAT THEY HAVE A SENATOR WHO IS WILLING TO LISTEN TO THEM, AND WILLING TO INVEST IN THEM. IT IS OUR JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET BACK OUT THERE, AND REMIND VOTERS WHY THEY TURNED OUT TO VOTE FOR SENATOR WARNOCK IN THE FIRST PLACE. SENATOR WARNOCK HAS A MODEL TO DELIVER A RUNOFF ELECTION TO THE STATE OF GEORGIA. I REMEMBER BEING ON THE VIEW JUST TWO YEARS AGO, LAWRENCE, AND WE WERE HAVING THE SAME DISCUSSION. BUT WE ALREADY. WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT WE GET OUR VOTERS BACK OUT. SENATOR WARNOCK IS TAKING THE QUESTIONS FROM REPORTERS, TALKING TO EVERYDAY VOTERS, WHEN HERSCHEL WALKER DID HIS FIRST APPEARANCE AFTER THEIR ONE OFF, IT WAS TED CRUZ -- THAT CRUZ ANSWERED THE QUESTIONS. HE DIDN'T EVEN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SO WE NEED A SENATOR WHO IS GOING TO BE RESPONSIVE TO GEORGIANS NOT SOMEONE WHO'S GONNA RUN AWAY FROM EVERY ISSUE AND DODGE GEORGIA VOTERS.  GEORGIA CONGRESSWOMAN NIKEMA WILLIAMS, THE CHAIR OF THE GEORGIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. AND WE'RE GONNA NEED TO HEAR FROM YOU, AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN JOIN US BETWEEN NOW AND DECEMBER 6TH WITH THAT CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA.  I'LL BE BACK, LAWRENCE. AND I'LL BE BACK TO CELEBRATE ON DECEMBER 6TH, WHEN WE DELIVER GEORGIA AGAIN.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  THAT IS TONIGHT'S LAST WORD. THE 11TH HOUR WITH STEPHANIE RUHLE WILL BE HAPPENING RIGHT AFTER THIS. AFTER THIS 20221112035549.078|20221112035813.489",

        "trs": "> THE MIDTERMS ARE OF COURSE A COLLECTION OF MANY RACES, SO THERE ARE MANY THEMES. AND ONE THEME WE HAVE BEEN COVERING THROUGHOUT, INCLUDING DURING THESE RACES, WAS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN AFTER THE SUPREME COURT ABSOLUTELY GUTTED ROE V. WADE. WELL, ABORTION ITSELF WAS LITERALLY ON THE BALLOT IN FIVE STATES AND WE SAW MOST SPECIFICALLY THERE THE BACKLASH, KENTUCKY SAW A REJECTION OF A BALLOT MEASURE THAT WOULD DENY CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR ABORTION. IN MONTANA, WHAT WAS BILLED AS AN ANTI-CHOICE REFERENDUM WAS REJECTED IN THAT RED STATE. NBC NEWS EXIT POLLING SHOWS THAT IT'S NOT A CLOSE CALL. 60% OF VOTERS SAY THEY WANT ABORTION TO BASICALLY BE LEGAL. THE MAJORITY ARE EITHER ANGRY OR DISAPPOINTED WHEN YOU ASK THE RESPONSE TO THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION. ALL OF THAT POWER IN BOTH ENERGY AND TURNOUT, AND THIS OF COURSE IS STILL AN OFF-YEAR ELECTION. DOES THAT PLAY INTO HOW WOMEN AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS SUPPORTERS VOTE IN THE NEXT ELECTION, WHICH IS GENERALLY HIGHER TURNOUT? WE WILL SEE. I WANTED TO GF YOU THAT UPDATE. WHEN WE COME BACK, THAT RED WAVE THAT NEVER HAPPENED, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW THE HYPE EVAPORATED AND WHY SOME ON THE RIGHT ARE FEELING A LITTLE EMBARRASSED. > ALSO TONIGHT, ALEX JONES ORDERED TO PAY EVEN MORE FOR HIS LIES. WE'VE TOLD YOU WE'RE GOING TO STAY ON THOSE ACCOUNTABILITY STORIES, AND WE WILL TONIGHT. STAY WITH US. 20221111234054.268|20221111234527.890",

THE JUDGE HAS NOW ADDED ANOTHER 400 PLUS MILLION TO THAT JUDGMENT. IT'S NOW ABOUT $1.5 BILLION IN DAMAGES DESIGNED FOR THE VICTIMS THAT HE HAS HURT. THE JUDGE HAS FROZEN MR. JONES' PERSONAL ASSETS. THAT MEANS HE CAN'T EVEN HIDE MONEY ON HIS PERSONAL ACCOUNTS, TO SAY NOTHING OF THE MANY COMPANIES THAT HE CONTROLS. A TEXAS COURT ALSO ORDERED HIM TO PAY $45 MILLION IN AN EARLIER JUDGMENT IN AUGUST. IN BOTH TRIALS, THE PARENTS HAVE EXPRESSED EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE UP AGAINST. HERE'S JONES ON THE NEW JUDGMENT.  I DON'T HAVE $2 MILLION. SOME PEOPLE SAY, OH, THE MEDIA SAYS HE WON'T PAY IT. WELL, I MEAN, IF I WEIGH 260 POUNDS AND THEY ASK FOR A TRILLION POUNDS, I DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH MORE FLESH.  HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT MUCH FLESH. IT'S FAR MORE THAN A POUND OF FLESH THAT THE COURTS ARE SEEKING. THAT IS PART OF A SERIES WE DO AROUND HERE CALLED FALLBACK. TODAY'S FALLBACK IS CERTAINLY FOR MR. JONES. BUT WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN MORE PEOPLE AND MORE FALLBACK TOPICS. KID MERO BACK ON THE BEAT. HE'S KNOWN FOR UPENDING LATE NIGHT WITH HOT TAKES AND A LOT OF ACTION. BODEGA BOYS DESUS AND MERO. HE ALSO HOLDS THE WORLD RECORD FOR PLAYING THE KAZOO.  THAT'S RIGHT.  HOW DO YOU TOP THAT KIND OF ENERGY?  YOU CAN'T.  NO. YOU MATCH IT WITH THE FLAVOR RIGHT HERE. FRIEND OF THE BEAT, MSNBC HOST ALICIA MENENDEZ. SHE'S THE AUTHOR OF \"THE LIKABILITY TRAP.\" HOW TO BREAK FREE AND SUCCEED AS YOU ARE WITH AN INDEX DEVOTED TO TRAP MUSIC. SHE ALSO HOSTS \"AMERICAN VOICES\" WEEKENDS, 6:00 P.M. EASTERN ON MSNBC.  GOT TO KEEP SELLING THOSE BOOKS. THANK YOU, ARI.  GOT THE BOOK IN THERE AND THE TRAP REFERENCE.  YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING? MULTIFACETED.  I ALSO LIKE THAT HE STILL GETS INTRO'D AS NEW YORK WHEN HE NOW LIVES IN JERSEY.  SPEAK ON IT.  LISTEN, YOU ARE VERY -- YOU'RE A PAL OF FAT JOE, RIGHT?  SURE.  FAT JOE ADVISED ME. HE SAID WHEN YOU GO TO THE BODEGA AND THEY CALL YOU HOLLYWOOD AND START ASKING YOU TO BUY STUFF AT A FASTER CLIP THAN BEFORE, THEN IT MIGHT BE TIME TO MOVE TO JERSEY.  ALSO SHOUT-OUT TO YOUR BEAUTIFUL FAMILY. YOU GOT FOUR KIDS, SO I COULD UNDERSTAND THAT LIFESTYLE LIVING. ALICIA, WHAT'S ON YOUR FALL BACK LIST?  MY FALLBACK LIST, THIS ELECTION THERE WERE SO MANY INTERESTING DYNAMICS. AMONG THEM WERE THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT CAME OUT. THERE WERE SOME PEOPLE WHO WERE -- HOW CAN I SAY THIS -- THEY WERE A LITTLE MAD ABOUT THAT. LET'S TAKE A LOOK.  LET'S TAKE A LOOK.  YOU MAD?  IT WAS YOUNG VOTERS THAT GAVE THE DEMOCRATS THEIR ADVANTAGE.  I THINK A LOT OF THE YOUNGER PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, THE LOCKDOWN MAYBE WASN'T SO BAD, RIGHT, FOR THEM? THEY GOT TO ORDER UBER EATS AND CATCH UP ON THE NETFLIX AND GET THEIR CHECKS.  LAURA, THE DEMOCRATS WERE ALSO VERY DELIBERATE IN THEIR PITCH TO YOUNG PEOPLE. THEY OFFERED THEM DRUGS, RECREATIONAL DRUGS.  POT.  ABORTION, PAID-OFF STUDENT LOANS.  YOU SOUND MAD THAT YOU DIDN'T GET THAT, HOMEY. I DID NOT ORDER A LOT OF UBER EATS. LET'S BE CLEAR. THERE'S A LOT OF FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT, OKAY?  NO. I KEEP THINKING ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE, RIGHT? WE USED TO BE YOUNG, BUT LIKE WE'RE NOT BEING COUNTED ANY MORE AS YOUNG PEOPLE.  MORTGAGE MILLENNIALS.  THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT GEN Z, AND I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING -- SORRY, SORRY. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT GEN Z. THE THING ABOUT THIS GENERATION THAT I ALWAYS THINK ABOUT IS LIKE WHEN WE WERE COMING UP, WE DID FIRE DRILLS. THESE KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL FROM THE TIME THEY ARE VERY LITTLE DOING ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLS. YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE CARRYING THAT LIFE EXPERIENCE WITH THEM INTO THE VOTING BOOTH, THAT THE STAKES FOR THEM ARE SO REAL, THAT THE STAKES ON CLIMATE CHANGE, ON THE ECONOMY, EVERYTHING ABOUT IT FOR THEM, BODILY AUTONOMY, ABSOLUTELY HUGE. SO THEY SHOWED UP DRIVEN BY THE ISSUES, AND THEN IT GETS REDUCED TO, IT WASN'T THAT BAD FOR THEM. THEY GOT A BUNCH OF FREE STUFF WHEN IN ACTUALITY, THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE GOING TO BE CONFRONTING THIS FUTURE.  I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS UP. YOU HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. BUT ALSO AGEISM CAN RUN IN MORE THAN ONE DIRECTION. THIS ANTI-ELDERLY AGEISM THAT WE SEE IN ALL SORTS WORKPLACE, IN CULTURE, THAT'S A PROBLEM. THE IDEA PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT ON THEIR SHOULDERS, INCLUDING DEBT, GET UP, REGISTER TO VOTE, AND VOTE IN AN OFF YEAR ELECTION AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN THE PUBLIC JOURNALISTIC SPACE BEING DOWN ON THAT, DRAGGING THAT, THAT'S MESSED UP. I WANT TO GO TO MERO'S EVOLUTION. LET'S SHOW PEOPLE HOW FUNNY YOU ARE. THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO COMEDY HERE.  DON'T GAMBLE WITH THE VIBES, BRO.  HE'S DOWN WITH THE OS, THE OLD SCHOOL.  HE'S HOLDING UP THE LINE IN THE BAGEL STORE SO I KNOCKED HIM OVER.  WE HAVE THE U.S. WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM CAPTAIN.  WHEN YOU SAY CLIMATE CHANGE, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? IT WAS COLD YESTERDAY AND NOW IT'S WARM.  I'M MITT ROMNEY, I ENJOY BAKED GOODS FROM HOSTESS.  I HAPPEN TO BE LACTOSE INTOLERANT, BUT I WILL ACCEPT YOUR COOKIE.  DO YOU PROVE, TALK ABOUT REACHING YOUNG PEOPLE, WHICH HAS NEVER HAD A --  I LOVE YOU'RE LAUGHING AT YOUR OWN JOKES.  SOMEBODY HAS TO DO IT. MY WIFE IS LIKE, TRY AGAIN.  DO YOU PROVE YOU CAN HAVE FUN WHILE TACKLING REAL SERIOUS STUFF? WE SAW THERE WITH AOC. YOU HAVE INTERVIEWED A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND WHAT'S YOUR FALLBACK?  LISTEN, YOU GOT TO GIVE PEOPLE A LITTLE BIT OF SUGAR WITH THE MEDICINE. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY THING, IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU WANT TO -- AS A FORMER EDUCATOR, YOU WANT TO FIND TEACHABLE MOMENTS WITHIN YOUR COMEDY. THAT'S WHAT I TRY TO MIX IN. NOT HEAVY HANDED, OF COURSE, BUT WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT, YOU SLIDE IT IN THERE. NOBODY EVEN KNOWS. IT'S LIKE -- LET'S NOT GO THERE. BUT MY FALLBACK GOES TO ONE JOHN KENNEDY, NOT THAT JOHN KENNEDY. AND HIS CAMPAIGN. ROLL IT.  VIOLENT CRIME IS SURGING IN LOUISIANA. WOKE LEADERS BLAME THE POLICE. IF YOU HATE COPS JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE COPS, THE NEXT TIME YOU GET IN TROUBLE, CALL A CRACKHEAD.  UM, YO, YOU KNOW WHAT'S WILD? I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HOW HE GOT RE-ELECTED. A LOT OF PEOPLE UNDERESTIMATE THE RESOURCEFULNESS OF A CRACKHEAD. I USED TO TAKE THE BUS -- I USED TO THAK THE EXPRESS BUS EVERY MORNING AND THE ONLY PEOPLE OUTSIDE WORKING AT 5:00 A.M. WERE THE CRACKHEADS. SO MAYBE THAT HELPS HIM IN A WEIRD ROUND ABOUT WAY. BUT REGARDLESS, YOU STILL HAVE TO FALL BACK BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE IN NEED. OKAY. THESE ARE ADDICTS BRO. AND IT'S NOT A FUNNY THING TO MAKE A JOKE ABOUT THEM UNLESS I DO IT.  I WAS WONDERING WHERE YOU WERE GOING TO GO WITH IT. THAT MAKES SENSE. I WANT TO GET ALSO BEFORE WE END THE WEEK, A LOT OF THE MEDIA AND RIGHT WING INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX REALLY OWN THEMSELVES ON THE RED WAVE. AND THEN SOME IN THE MEDIA SORT OF REPEATED IT BECAUSE WE NEVER SAW THE RED WAVE COME. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A FLASHBACK.  HOW DELICIOUS.  IT WASN'T LOOKING LIKE A RED WAVE EARLIER IN AUGUST. AND NOW IT LOOKS LIKE A TSUNAMI.  THE POLITICOS WITH WHOM I SPOKE TODAY ALL AGLEE, AS OF NOW, A MODEST RED WAVE AT THE VERY LEAST SEEMS TO BE BUILDING.  IT'S GOING TO LOOK MORE LIKE DEEP IMPACT, THE TSUNAMI AT THE END BUT COLORED RED.  THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT'S GOING TO LOOK GOOD FOR REPUBLICANS. THE LONGER ANSWER IS IT'S GOING TO LOOK VERY GOOD FOR THEM.  I'M SHOCKED THERE WAS NO RED WAVE. IF YOU THINK ABOUT INFLATION, A 40-YEAR HIGH. CRIME, THE WORST SINCE THE 1980s. THE UNPOPULAR PRESIDENT, WITH AN AGENDA THAT'S MORE GREEN ORIENTED THAN PEOPLE ORIENTED.  I THINK THE PREDICTIONS GOT TO FALL BACK.  YOU HAVE TO FALL ALL THE WAY BACK. YOU FORGOT, LIKE WE SAID, TIKTOKERS ARE VOTING, GUYS. AND YOU WERE WRONG. YOU WERE WRONG. YOU TAKE YOUR \"L,\" EAT IT.  WHAT'S AN \"L\"?  A LOSS.  THEY UNDERESTIMATED THE EXTENT TO WHICH PEOPLE WERE FIRED UP ABOUT ROE, THE EXTENT TO WHICH PEOPLE WERE GOING TO COME OUT AND SUPPORT BODILY AUTONOMY. THIS MAY NOT BE THEIR ISSUE, THEY SAID I DON'T WANT THE GOVERNMENT IN MY BUSINESS. THEN I THINK ALSO, I WAS TALKING WITH VOTERS. THEY DON'T NECESSARILY TALK ABOUT DEMOCRACY, PER SE, NOT 1/6, BUT WHAT THEY WERE SAYING IS SOME OF THESE CANDIDATES SEEM WAY TOO OUT THERE AND WAY TOO OUT OF TOUCH.  CAN I SHOW YOU A MEME?  PLEASE.  MEME NUMBER ONE, WAITING FOR THE RED WAVE. AND IT ENDS UP, ESCOBAR IN AN EMPTY POOL THERE.  SOMEBODY SAID THIS WAS -- I THINK IT WAS BEN SHAPIRO WHO SAID IT WAS LESS OF A RED WAVE AND MORE OF A RED WEDDING.  HE DID SAY THAT.  SO THAT'S THE FIRST AND LAST TIME I WILL EVER QUOTE THAT LITTLE TROLL.  BARS.  THEY KEPT UPPING THE ANTE. WENT FROM BEING A WAVE TO A TSUNAMI. MAYBE JUST MANAGE EXPECTATIONS.  AND AS WE WERE EXPLORING IN OUR COVERAGE, THAT WAS ALSO A REAL DELIBERATE STRATEGY TO TRY TO DEPRESS DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT, TO USE JUNK POLLS. I GOT ONE MORE MEME FOR YOU. I KNOW YOU LIKE YOUR MEMES. THIS ONE IS SIMPLE. OH, LOOK, IT'S THE RED WAVE. BUT IT NEVER CAME.  SEE.  POETRY.  THE INCIDENT IS UNDEFEATED AND REMAINS UNDEFEATED. THE INCIDENT IS 1,000-0. YOU CAN'T BEAT THE INCIDENT. YOU CAN'T BEAT MEMES. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST TELLS YOU, THE MEMES ARE COMING.  LASTLY, WITH 15 SECONDS, WHAT SHOULD WE LOOK OUT FOR NEXT? A LOT OF PEOPLE LOVE YOUR SHOW WHICH CAME TO AN END?  OH, BABY. THE BOY SPREAD HIS WINGS. I STARTED AS A WRITER. I CONTINUED THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF AROUND THE CORNER. I'M ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN FORMULA ONE RACING. WE CALL EVERY RACE EVERY SUNDAY. AND THIS SUNDAY, WE WILL BE CALLING THE RACE IN -- I FORGOT WHERE IT WAS, BUT WE'RE GOING TO BE CALLING IT.  I APPRECIATE YOUR HONESTLY. DON'T WORRY IF I WRITE RHYMES.  I WRITE CHECKS.  THAT'S IT. THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU.  PEACE AND LOVE.  \"THE REIDOUT\" IS UP NEXT. rumr 20221111235645.001|20221111235909.611",

        "trs": "> SINGLE WOMEN AND VOTERS UNDER 40 HAVE BEEN CAPTURED BY DEMOCRATS, SO WE NEED THESE LADIES TO GET MARRIED.  IT'S A CAMPAIGN APPARATUS, AND ONLY THE DEMOCRATS HAVE IT.  WE HAVE TWO OTHER OPPONENTS WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. ONE IS THE MAIN STREAM MEDIA, THEY'RE 90% AGAINST US. THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO SPIN THINGS AGAINST US, AND THE OTHER ARE THE INSTITUTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT ITSELF, THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, THE FBI, AND WHEN THOSE TWO ENTITIES GET TOGETHER, THE DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE TO BE GOOD.  I RESISTED THIS ALL WEEK, TIM, BECAUSE IT FELT MEAN, BUT I COULDN'T. THE MIDDLE TUCKER CARLSON IS LITERALLY A MOUTH PIECE FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN AS HE WAGES A CAMPAIGN OF TERRORISM AGAINST THE CIVILIAN POPULATION OF UKRAINE. THE FIRST GUY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT, PUT A RING ON IT. BEYONCE WANTS HER SONG BACK. WHAT IS HAPPENING OVER THERE?  YOU DIDN'T EVEN PLAY MY FAVORITE CLIP FROM THE FIRST GUY, JESSE WATERS WHO WENT ON TO SAY HOW THESE YOUNG WOMEN ARE THE NEW WELFARE QUEENS BECAUSE THEY GOT THEIR STUDENT LOANS REIMBURSE.  WHO PAID FOR HIS COLLEGE? WHERE DOES THAT COME FROM?  IT'S A SHOCK THAT YOUNG VOTERS WENT PLUS 28 TO THE DEMOCRATS AFTER WATCHING THOSE CLIPS, ISN'T IT?  THEY COULD GIVE SPEECHES IF THEY JUST STUCK WITH THE REPUBLICANS. WHAT?  AND HERE'S THE ISSUE. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PLENTY OF TIME OVER THE NEXT YEAR TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH TRUMP AND WHETHER THEY PUSH HIM ASIDE OR NOT AND ET CETERA. BUT THOSE CLIPS SHOW THE UNDERLYING SICKNESS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH TRUMP IS NOT REALLY GOING AWAY. THESE GUYS ARE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY REPELLED VOTERS SO MUCH. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THE REPUBLICANS THIS YEAR TO HAVE NOT WON IN A BIG LAND SLIDE. HISTORICALLY, IT ALWAYS HAPPENS IN THE FIRST MIDTERM, WHEN THE ECONOMY IS BAD, THE APPLE PARTY ALWAYS DOES WELL. THE REASON WHY THEY DIDN'T DO WELL IS BECAUSE THEIR TALKING POINTS, THEIR MESSAGES IS SO REPULSIVE. NOT EVERY REPUBLICAN, BUT THE MOST ANGRY AGRIEVED REPUBLICANS AND AS LONG AS THEY CONTINUE TO TRY TO APPEAL TO THAT BASE, THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP LOSING THIS BIG MIDDLE, AND THEIR ANALYSIS FROM THE ELECTIONS JUST SHOW THAT THEY HAVE NOT LEARNED A THING. SOME OF THEM WANT TO JUST BLAME IT ALL ON TRUMP AND SAY IT'S TRUMP'S FAULT, AND IT PARTIALLY IS, THEY SHOULD HAVE DUMPED HIM A LONG TIME AGO. BUT THIS OTHER ELEMENT SHOWS THAT THEY DON'T GET IT. THEY DON'T GET WHY THEY'RE TURNING OFF BIG AMOUNTS OF DEMOGRAPHIC IN THE COUNTRY.  DO YOU REMEMBER THE MOVIE HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN TEN DAYS? HOW TO LOSE A MIDTERM WITH THE ECONOMIC WHERE IT IS IS AN EFFORT TO DO THAT BADLY. I THINK IT'S TO YOUR POINT. I THINK THE SUPREME COURT AND DOBBS AND ELECTION DENIALISM ARE JUST THESE CHAINS AROUND THE REPUBLICAN BRAND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE A LOT LONGER THAN TWO YEARS TO SHAKE.  ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY ARE UP AGAINST THE REALITY OF A DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT. THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHETHER THE OBAMA COALITION COULD HOLD. WE TALK ABOUT AAPI VOTES, LATINO GROUPS, AND THE GROUP WE TALK ABOUT THE LEAST THE UNMARRIED WOMEN, WOMEN WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN MARRIED, DIVORCED, WIDOWED, SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A BROAD SECTION OF WOMEN. WHAT DO THEY HAVE IN COMMON? THEY ARE NOT MARRIED TO SOMEONE OFTEN TALKING TO THEM ABOUT THEIR POLITICS --  OR WATCHING FOX NEWS.  OR WATCHING FOX NEWS. WHAT STRUCK ME ABOUT THE WATERING THING WAS TO ME IT HAD BIG INSELL VIBES. THE WAY THEY'RE HETERO SEXUAL MEN WHO BLAME IT ON WOMEN AND SOCIETY THAT THEY'VE NOT HAD ROMANTIC SUCCESS. YOU HAVE JESSE WATERS BLAMING IT ON WOMEN AND SOCIETY THAT HIS IDEOLOGY HAS NOT HAD POLITICAL ELECTORAL SEX -- SUCCESS -- EXCUSE ME.  OR THAT. I MEAN, THAT'S A LONGER CONVERSATION MAYBE TO HAVE AN A PODCAST, BUT I THINK IT'S PART OF THE MIX AS WELL. THESE GUYS, THOUGH, COUNT ON THEIR VIEWERS THE WAY POLITICIANS COUNT ON THEIR BASE, AND I THINK WHAT'S SHOWING IS THAT. THEY COUNT ON THE VIEWERS TO DO SOMETHING PERFORMATIVE IN THE ELECTIONS BECAUSE THEY TOLD THEM TO, EVEN THOUGH IN DEFAMATION LAWSUITS, FOR EXAMPLE, THEY ADMIT, WE'RE NOT JOURNALISTS, WE'RE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH. WE'RE ENTERTAINMENT. THEY'RE BEING SUED FOR MORE THAN $1 BILLION BY THE MAKERS OF VOTING MACHINES. I MEAN, YOU CAN'T FOOL ALL YOUR VIEWERS ALL THE TIME.  WELL, IT ALSO CAN BE SELF DEFEATING WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT, SINGLE WOMEN, YOU'RE MISSING WHY YOU ACTUALLY LOST WHICH IS ON ISSUES LIKE ABORTION. THE BIDEN COALITION ALSO HEAD IT TOGETHER. THEY STOPPED TALKING TO SOME OF THOSE WHITE WORKING CLASS VOTERS IN THE WAY THEY WANT TO BE TALKED TO. IF YOU LOOK AT JOHN FETTERMAN. HE WON BY ABOUT TEN POINTS.  I WENT TO THAT COUNTY AFTER TRUMP FLIPPED IT. I SAW THAT FETTERMAN WON IT BY A LOT.  BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. BIDEN WAS ONLY WINNING IT BY A FEW. I WAS WITH DOUG MASTREANO, AND HE WAS POINTING TO MOMENTUM YEAR AND IF I DO WELL HERE, AND THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING ON FOX NEWS. THEY ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT ISSUES THAT WILL MATTER TO THE VOTERS WHO WILL DECIDE THE ELECTION. MAYBE IT WILL MATTER IN A PRIMARY. TO QUOTE JEB BUSH. I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. IT'S FOG TO KEEP HAPPENING.  WE HAVEN'T EVEN TALKED ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE. TO MY UNDERSTANDING, HALF OF GEN-Z ISN'T EVEN ELIGIBLE TO VOTE YET. THEY HAVE TO KNOW THAT SHIFT IS COMING. I RAN FOR -- I STARTED ORGANIZING BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED ABOUT BEING SHOT AT SCHOOL. AGAIN, THAT IS SUCH A LIVED EXPERIENCE FOR THIS GENERATION. I REMEMBER REPORTING OUT OF PARKLAND AND TALKING TO THESE PEOPLE WEREN'T THAT MUCH YOUNGER THAN ME, BUT THEIR EXPERIENCE IS SO DIFFERENT THAN OURS. WE WERE PRACTICING FIRE DRILLS, THEY'RE PRACTICING ACTIVE SHOOTER DRILLS.  FROM THE TIME THEY'RE THREE.  WE'RE BOTH MOMS. SO THIS IS VERY REAL.  OR MOMS AND DADS. IT'S JUST AMAZING.

        "trs": "> WE SAW EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS IN THESE MIDTERM ELECTIONS THAT NO ONE THOUGHT POSSIBLE. MORE INDEPENDENTS VOTED FOR DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANS IN THIS ELECTION. YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU VOTED HISTORIC NUMBERS JUST AS YOU DID TWO YEARS AGO. YOUNG PEOPLE VOTED TO CONTINUE ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS, GUN VIOLENCE, PERSONAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, STUDENT DEBT RELIEF, ALL THOSE THINGS, WHICH YOU STEPPED UP TO DO.  PRESIDENT BIDEN PRAISING YOUNG AMERICANS FOR SHOWING UP TO THE POLLS IN NEAR RECORD FASHION IN THIS YEAR'S MIDTERMS, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT. DIRECTOR OF POLLING AT THE INSTITUTE OF POLITICS AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY, ALSO AN MSNBC POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR JOINING US. ALSO ARE WITH US, VICTOR XI, THE YOUNGEST ELECTED DELEGATE FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN IN 2020. AND THE CO-FOUNDER AND CEO OF ALL IN-- LAUREN LEADER JOINS US. THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO BE SURPRISED HERE BECAUSE SOME OF THE FOCUS GROUPS WE SAW, A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WERE MIDTERMS. AND YET A LOT DID.  YEAH. ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. LET ME BREAK IT DOWN AS SIMPLY AS I POSSIBLY CAN, MIKA. JUST LOOK AT FIRST OF ALL THE MAJORITY, 60% OF VOTERS IN THIS COUNTRY OVER THE AGE OF 45 BY A MARGIN OF TEN POINTS THEY VOTED REPUBLICAN IN HOUSE RACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND MOST SENATE RACES AS WELL. THE DEMOCRATS WENT IN WITH A MINUS 10 ADVANTAGE. THEY PUT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON YOUNG PEOPLE TO DO TWO THINGS, A, TO SHOW UP, AND B TO SUPPORT DEMOCRATS. YOUNG PEOPLE UNDER 45 SUPPORTED DEMOCRATS BY 13 POINTS. YOUNG PEOPLE UNDER 30 SUPPORTED DEMOCRATS BY 28. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN A RED WAVE ELECTION IF NOT FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF YOUNG MILLENNIALS AND GEN-Z'ers.  IN ARIZONA, LOOKING AT THE CURRENT NUMBERS, MARK KELLY AMONG VOTERS 18 TO 29 IS PLUS 56, VOTERS 30 TO 44 PLUS 19. ONCE YOU GET PAST 44, MASTERS WINS. SO THIS IS A STORY OF THE YOUNG VOTE. THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT HERE. AND I GUESS THE QUESTION, LARGER QUESTION GOING FORWARD IS WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR SORT OF THE SHIFT IN VOTE HERE, WHICH IS WHICH IS TO SAY YOUNG PEOPLE BY AND LARGE GOING FOR DEMOCRATS? VOTERS, PUTTING IT BLUNTLY, WHO WILL BE AROUND FAR LONG TIME.  WILLIE, THIS IS NOT A SURPRISE. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS ON YOUR SHOW FOR YEARS NOW. THIS IS THE THIRD ELECTION IN A ROW WHERE DEMOCRATS HAVE RELIED ON THE YOUTH VOTE TO MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. IN '18, '20, '22, IT'S THE SAME THING. REPUBLICANS NOW ARE A SMALL MELTING ICEBERG. REPUBLICANS LOST WHITE NONCOLLEGE VOTERS UNDER 30. THAT'S THE HEART AND SOUL OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY RIGHT NOW. THEY LOST THE NEW GENERATION ALREADY FOR THIS DEMOGRAPHIC.  VICTOR, WHAT WAS IT THAT BROUGHT YOUNG PEOPLE TO THE POLLS? TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT REALLY DROVE THEM THERE.  YEAH, SO WHAT WE SEE FROM THE DATA OVERWHELMINGLY IS THAT ABORTION WAS THE NUMBER-ONE DRIVER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE SHOWING UP TO THE BALLOT BOX AND VOTING. I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR EARLIER SEGMENT BEFORE THIS PANEL AND YOU WERE MENTIONING THE FALL OF ROME AND WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY YOUNG WOMEN TO FACE THAT POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT WITH ROE. FOR SO MANY WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME WE SAW A RIGHT GET OVERTURNED BY THE SUPREME COURT. YOUNG PEOPLE GREW UP IN A TIME WHEN ABORTION WAS BASICALLY A GUARANTEE. TO SEE THAT WAS ALARMING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE, AND YOU COULD SEE IN THE DATA AFTER THE FALL OF ROE THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO REGISTERED TO VOTE AND MADE THEIR CASES HEARD. YOU SAW THAT IN KANSAS IN STATES LIKE MICHIGAN AND OTHERS WHERE ABORTION WAS VERY MUCH ON THE BALLOT POP YOU ALSO HAD OTHER ISSUES LIKE CLIMATE CHANGE AND STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS AND GUN REFORM. THESE ISSUES ARE IMMEDIATE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEY SHOWED UP TO VOTE.  VICTOR, IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO SHOWED UP TO VOTE WENT OVERWHELMINGLY FOR DEMOCRATS AND PROBABLY STOPPED THE RED WAVE. BUT AMONG ELIGIBLE VOTERS 18 TO 29, TURNOUT WAS ONLY 27%. HOW DO YOU GET THAT NUMBER UP IN THIS COUNTRY?  I'LL START BY SAYING WE DON'T HAVE THE FINAL TURNOUT NUMBER YET, BUT BASED ON EARLY DATA, ONE THING IS CLEAR, THAT'S YOUNG PEOPLE VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY FOR DEMOCRATS IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE AND YOUNG REPUBLICANS STAYED AT HOME, WHICH I THINK IS DRIVING A LOT OF THE TURNOUT DOWN. IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SHOULD DO GOING FORWARD, I'M GRATEFUL TO BE PART OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLED LAWYERS OF TOMORROW. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER GEN-Z-LED ORGANIZATIONS OUT THERE MAKING CALLS, DOING RELATIONAL ORGANIZING, AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE GOING FORWARD. WE'LL NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK. WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN GEORGIA COMING UP IN DECEMBER, 2024, MILLENNIALS AND GEN-Z'ers WILL OUTNUMBER. IT WILL TAKE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE AT THE HELM DOING THE WORK AND TAKE DEMOCRATS INVESTING IN YOUNG PEOPLE. LIKE JOHN SAID, THERE IS NO PATH TO VICTORY IN ANY ELECTION GOING FORWARD WITHOUT YOUNG PEOPLE TURNING OUT AND VOTING FOR DEMOCRATS.  SO IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES THAT DROVE THE YOUNG VOTERS, IN A WAY IT PORTENDS FAR LOT MORE TO GO TO THE POLLS IN 2024 GIVEN THAT THIS WAS A MIDTERM, WHICH IS USUALLY NOT REALLY WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE END UP SHOWING UP, VOTING IN A MIDTERM. ALSO THESE ARE THE KIDS, SOME OF THEM, THAT GREW UP IN THE ERA OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. LIKE, THEY KNOW SOMEBODY OR HEARD OF SOMETHING OR WERE THERE WHEN THESE SLAUGHTERS WERE HAPPENING.  I JUST DID A FOCUS GROUP LAST NIGHT, MIKA, AND EVERY MEMBER OF MY FOCUS GROUP FROM EIGHT DIFFERENT STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY STILL TALKED ABOUT THE TRAUMA OF GROWING UP IN THIS ERA. I WANT TO PUT A FINER POINT ON WHAT VICTOR SAID. THIS VICTORY FOR DEMOCRATS AND YOUNG PEOPLE IS NOT IN SPITE OF BUT BECAUSE OF JOE BIDEN. YOU HAVE THIS ENERGY FROM THE GRASSROOTS, BUT UNLESS IT'S EMPOWERED FROM THE TOP DOWN, WE WON'T OPTIMIZE THAT. THE WORK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION PUT IN TO LISTEN TO AND TO PROVIDE AND TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISES FROM 2020 AND TO ENGAGE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS, THAT'S WHAT I THINK WAS ABLE TO SPARK THE ENERGY TO MAKE THEM ORGANIZED.  JOHN DELLA VOLPE AND JONATHAN SHI, THANK YOU SO MUCH. LAUREN LEADER, YOUR PIECE ON \"THE HILL,\" \"IT'S THE WOMEN, STUPID. THE NARRATIVE IN THESE MIDTERMS, AS IN SO MANY RECENT ELECTIONS, HAS BEEN REDUCTIVE, GROUPING WOMEN INTO OVERLY SIMPLISTIC CATEGORIES -- THINK SOCCER MOMS, SECURITY MOMS, ET CETERA. WOMEN ARE MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT. THE SUPREME COURT'S DOBBS V. JACKSON DECISION DROVE A VOTER REGISTRATION SURGE AND MOTIVATION TO TURN OUT AMONG A COALITION OF WOMEN THAT DEMOCRATS NEEDED AND THAT MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE ELECTION. MANY OF US WHO WORK ON WOMEN'S POLITICAL PARTICIPATION CALLED IT CORRECTLY -- WE KNEW THAT THE EARLY VOTE COUNT AND POLLS THAT FOCUSED ON THEM ALL POINTED TO ABORTION AS A HIGH MOTIVATOR.\" I THINK IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO THE ELECTION, A LOT OF ANALYSTS LOOKING AT THE POLLS KIND OF FELL AWAY FROM THAT AND THOUGHT NO, NO, WHAT IS IT THAT'S BUGGING PEOPLE? IT'S CRIME. THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ABORTION. AND YOU STAYED TRUE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT WOMEN ARE THINKING WALKING INTO THE VOTING BOOTH.  I THINK WHEN YOU HAVE POLLS LIKE THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" POLL WE TALKED ABOUT ON ELECTION DAY, WHICH ULTIMATELY WAS 150 WOMEN IN OUR POLL, THESE WERE NOT RELIABLE, AND I THINK THOSE OF US WHO FOLLOW THIS CLOSELY KNEW THERE WAS NO WAY THAT WOMEN WERE SWINGING 15 POINTS AWAY FROM WHERE THEY'D BEEN FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS ON THESE ISSUES IN THE LAST WEEK BEFORE THE ELECTION. IT DEFIED LOGIC, DIDN'T MAKE SENSE. AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE TRUE. CLEARLY PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THE ECONOMY, BUT WOMEN ARE CAPABLE OF CARING ABOUT MORE THAN ONE THING. WE'RE COMPLEX PEOPLE, AS WE ALL ARE. AND THESE VERY REDUCTIVE POLLS THAT LISTED TOP ISSUES AND THOUGHT WOMEN WOULD VOTE EXCLUSIVELY ON THAT WERE JUST WRONG. THEY'VE BEEN TELLING US ALL SUMMER, ALL YEAR THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ELECTION FOR THEM, THE DOBBS DECISION, GALVANIZING, DRIVING THEM TO THE POLLS, THE REASON THEY WERE TURNING OUT, TRUE FOR INDEPENDENT WOMEN AND DEMOCRATIC WOMEN AND SUPER TRUE FOR THE YOUNGER WOMEN. IT WAS TRANSFORMATIVE. DOBBS REWROTE THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE.  IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, AS YOU WRITE ABOUT, THEY TOOK BACK THE STATEHOUSE. THEY TOOK BACK THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 40, 50 YEARS.  WOW.  ABORTION WAS ON THE BALLOT.  YEAH.  IT WAS LITERALLY A MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. GOVERNOR WHITMER RAN UP A BIG MARGIN AND ABORTION HAD A LOT TO DO WITH IT.  WHITMER WON 75% OF THE FEMALE VOTE. IT WASN'T EVEN CLOSE. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAW ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THIS COALITION OF WOMEN -- THE FACT IS WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT POLITICAL DIVIDES IN THIS COUNTRY. THE TRUTH IS THEY'RE REALLY GENDER DIVIDES. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY WHITE AND MALE. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY FEMALE. AND WOMEN ARE THE MAJORITY OF THE ELECTORATE. THEY'VE TURNED EVERY ELECTION SINCE 1908. THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO SHOW UP. THEY TURNED THIS ELECTION TOO.  FAIR TO SAY THAT WOMEN STEPPED UP, AS THEY OFTEN DO, IN CASES LIKE THIS, BUT ESPECIALLY THEY'RE SENSIBLE. THEY DON'T LIKE INSURRECTIONS, PEOPLE CRAWLING OVER THE CAPITOL, DEFECATING ON IT, BEATING UP PEOPLE, BREAKING WINDOWS. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY WANT TO BE INVOLVED WITH. SECONDLY, THEY DON'T LIKE THEIR RIGHTS TAKEN AWAY. AND I WOULD ARGUE A LOT OF MEN FEEL THAT WAY AS WELL, WHETHER IT'S, YOU KNOW, NOT -- SUPPORTING THE RULE OF LAW BUT ALSO SUPPORTING THE WOMEN IN THEIR LIVES TO HAVE RIGHTS.  I LOVE THAT STORY MAGGIE HASSAN TOLD THIS MORNING ABOUT THE DOOR SHE KNOCKED ON, THE OLDER GENTLEMAN PULLS OUT HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND SAYS, \"I'M VOTING FOR HER.\" EXACTLY RIGHT. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATION OF THAT. AND, YOU KNOW, WE SAID IT ALL SUMMER, DOBBS IS A GALVANIZING ISSUE AND YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE MODERATE CANDIDATES WHO SAW THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. INDEPENDENT WOMEN ARE SO VITAL TO THE DEMOCRATIC COALITION, AND THOSE ARE THE WOMEN WHO TURNED AWAY FROM THE EXTREMES. I THINK THEY'LL STAY AWAY FROM THE EXTREMES. I THINK THIS IS A LONG-TERM TREND. AS NANCY PELOSI SAID, AND WE SHOULD LISTEN, SHE'S USUALLY RIGHT, AMERICA IS FUNDAMENTALLY A CENTRALIZED COUNTRY.  LAUREN LEADER, AS ALWAYS, THANKS FOR COMING ON. GREAT TO HAVE YOU. > COMING UP ON \"MORNING JOE,\" THERE IS SOME OPTIMISM THAT INFLATION MAY HAVE PEAKED BASED ON YESTERDAY'S BETHER THAN EXPECTED CONSUMER REPORT. THE DATA SENT WALL STREET TO ITS LARGEST RALLY IN TWO YEARS, AND IT APPEARS THE MARKETS WILL BUILD ON THOSE GAINS TODAY. WE'RE LIVE WITH CNBC WITH THAT. BUT BEFORE WE GO TO BREAK, WILLIE, YOUR WEEK ISN'T OVER.  I HAVE A GOOD ONE SUNDAY.  WHAT IS IT?  DANIEL RADCLIFFE.  STOP IT!  HE'S STARRING IN THE NEW WEIRD AL JANKOVIC PARODY BIOPICCOLI. HE'S AMAZING. HILARIOUS MOVIE. AND HE'S INCREDIBLY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT BEING HARRY POTTER, THE MOST FAMOUS 12-YEAR-OLD ON THE PLANET WHEN CAST IN THAT ROLE.  SO SWEET.  HE'S LIVED WITH IT IN A GRATEFUL WAY FOR A LONG TIME. WE TALK ABOUT THAT AND THIS FUNNY MOVIE WHERE HE PLAYS WEIRD AL JANKOVIC.

        "trs": "> HERSCHEL WALKER IS A NIGHTMARE FOR LIBERALS, HE IS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE, THEY HAD BELITTLED HIM, READED HIM LIKE CRAP, HIS FAMILY. STAND BY HERSCHEL TONIGHT. IF YOU CAN GIVE, GIVE. IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY THAT CAN GIVE, ASK THEM TO DO IT.  LORD, SOUTH CAROLINA SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM ALMOST COMING TO TEARS DEPENDING -- WHAT IS WRONG WITH HIM? WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO LINDSEY? THAT IS OUR QUESTION EVERY YEAR, ISN'T IT?  HE WANTS TO CONTROL THE SENATE. THAT IS IT ALL THAT MATTERS.  AND THAT WAS HIM TEARFULLY DEFENDING GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE HERSCHEL WALKER WHOSE RACE IS HEADED FOR RUNOFF IF A FEW WEEKS. AND WE'LL GO OVER TO STEVE KORNACKI AT THE BIG BOARD FOR THE LATEST ON THE OTHER TWO SENATE RACES THAT REMAIN UP IN THE AIR THIS MORNING. THE HOST OF ON-BRAND WITH DON ANY DEUTSCHE PODCAST IS HERE WITH US.  HELLO.  I GUESS I NEED TO GET THAT PODCAST PART IN THERE. IT IS THE ON BRAND WITH DONNY DEUTSCH PODCAST.  AND YOU HAVE GREAT GUESTS.  YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY.  I'M A WORK IN PROGRESS.  AND KATTY KAY IS STILL WITH US. SHE DID \"WAY TOO EARLY,\" WHICH I THINK SHE ONCE TOLD US THAT WE WERE CERTIFIABLE TO DO THESE HOURS.  SHE IS RIGHT ABOUT THAT.  AND THEN SHE DOES \"WAY TOO EARLY.\"  FAIR ENOUGH.  GOOD TO HAVE YOU. ALL RIGHT. SO FIRST OF ALL, GIVE US YOUR TAKE ON TRUMP AND LINDSAY STILL PUSHING FOR HERSCHEL WALKER, ULTIMATELY THAT IS FOR DONALD TRUMP ULTIMATELY? THEY ARE NEVER GOING TO WALK AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP?  LINDSAY IS A SENSITIVE GUY, YOU KNOW, HE CARES, HE FEELS. AND AS FAR AS DONALD TRUMP, AND I SAID THIS THE OTHER DAY, WE'RE JUST SEEING THE BEGINNING OF WHAT IS GOING TO BE A PATHETIC BUT FOR THE REPUBLICANS TROUBLING SHOW. EVERYONE IS GOING THAT THE REPUBLICANS NEED TO WALK AWAY. HE IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE.  BUT YOU'VE GOT LIKE HOSTS ON HIS NETWORKS SAYING THAT YOU HAVE TO WALK AWAY WHEN THE VOTERS DON'T WANT YOU.  IS HE GOING TO LISTEN TO SOMEBODY FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OR SOMEBODY FROM FOX? FOX HAS ALREADY TURNED ON HIM AND HE IS ALREADY DRAWINGS LINES THERE. TRUMP WILL BURN THE HOUSE DOWN WITH HIM. HE MIGHT END UP WITH JUST 15% OR 20% OF THE LEK ELECTOR THE RAT, BUT HE HAS ENOUGH TO STILL IN HIS OWN WAY PULL THE LEVER. SO THE REPUBLICANS HAVE A HUGE, HUGE PROBLEM GOING FORWARD. WE KEEP SAYING HE'S GOING TO STEP AWAY. WHAT? HAS ANYBODY BEEN WATCHING THE TRUMP SHOW THE LAST SIX OR SEVEN YEARS? AND AS I SAID, BEST THING TO HAPPEN FOR THE DEMOCRATS IS HE IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY. I DON'T THINK THAT HE WILL BE THEIR CANDIDATE. AND I SAID THIS THE OTHER DAY, I THINK THAT HE WILL RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT. HE IS NOT GOING TO LET RON DeSANTIS BE PRESIDENT. HE IS A ZERO SUM GAME GUY.  HE HAD THAT TOTALLY INSANE RANT.  THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF WHAT WE'LL SEE -- IF YOU THINK WE'VE SEEN NUT SO FAR, JUST STAY TUNED.  TO HIS POINT THOUGH, THE PARTY DOESN'T JUST GET TO WALK AWAY FROM DONALD TRUMP. THERE IS NO SIGNING CEREMONY IN THE DECK OF A SHIP WHERE HE GOES OKAY, I'M OUT, IT IS YOUR PARTY NOW. HE IS THERE FOREVER.  FOREVER.  I MEAN, AND WE NEVER HAVE SEEN HIM AS A LOSER. HE IS A LOSER, ALWAYS THE TOP LOOKING DOWN. NOW HE IS ON THE BOTTOM LOOKING UP. YOU WANT CRAZY, HERE IT COMES.  LET'S GO TO STEVE KORNACKI, HE IS BACK OVER AT THE BIG BOARD. STEVE, GOOD MORNING, WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT NEVADA. I SEE IT UP ON THE BOARD BEHIND YOU. AND ARIZONA THIS MORNING. AND ANY NEW NUMBERS TO SHARE THAT MIGHT INDICATE WHICH WAY SOME OF THE RACES ARE TRENDING?  WE HAVE SOME BIG DEVELOPMENTS IN NEVADA. IT WAS CLOSE TO MIDNIGHT LAST NIGHT AND WE GOT A BIG DUMP OF VOTES IN FROM THE RENO AREA HERE. AND WE GOT NEARLY 20,000 VOTES IN. AND THEY ACTUALLY FAVORED THE DEMOCRAT CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO BY A WIDE MARGIN. A BIT OF A SURPRISE BECAUSE I THINK THE EXPECTATION WAS THAT IT WAS MORE OF AN EVEN MIX BASED ON WHAT WE KNEW ABOUT THE PARTY COMPOSITION OF THE BALLOTS THAT WERE BEING COUNTED. SO WITH THAT, CORTEZ MASTO WAS ABLE TO KNOCK THE LEAD INSIDE OF 10,000 VOTES. ONE OF THE RURAL COUNTIES ALSO REPORTED OUT LATE, THAT IS WHERE LAXALT HAS BEEN RUNNING UP HUGE NUMBERS. SO HE WAS ABLE TO BRING HIS LEAD BACK UP TO AROUND 9,000. CORTEZ MASTO HAD TAKEN IT DOWN TO 8,000 OR SO. SO WHAT IS LEFT IN NEVADA AND WHEN WILL WE GET AN ANSWER. THERE ARE STILL BALLOTS LEFT, THERE MAY BE AS MANY AS 20,000. BUT OFFICIALS ARE INDICATING THAT NOT ALL OF THOSE 20,000 ARE SO WILL MAKE IT TO THE POINT OF BEING COUNTED. BASED ON THE UPDATE THAT WE GOT LAST NIGHT, I THINK THERE HAD BEEN AN EXPECTATION THAT MAYBE THE VOTE WOULD BE MORE OF AN EVEN SPLIT BUT WE'LL WAIT AND WE'LL SEE. CLARK COUNTY IS THE OTHER BIGGIE, THIS IS WHERE LAS VEGAS IS. THERE IS AT LEAST 50,000 VOTES, 50,000 BALLOTS, WE THINK A LITTLE HIGHER TO COME OUT OF HERE. MAINLY WHAT WE KNOW THEM TO BE ARE BALLOTS THAT WERE DROPPED OFF IN DROP BOXES ON ELECTION DAY. WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING IN CLARK COUNTY THE LAST COUPLE NIGHTS IS EVERY UPDATE HAS BEEN FAVORING CORTEZ MASTO BY 60%, 65%. OBVIOUSLY IF SHE COULD WIN REITs REMAINING 50,000 PLUS THAT WOULD GIVE HER A REAL OPPORTUNITY. THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS IN CLARK. NUMBER ONE, IS THERE A DIFFERENT SORT OF CHARACTER POLITICALLY TO THE BALLOTS THAT WERE DROPPED OFF IN PERSON IN THOSE DROP BOXES ON ELECTION DAY THAN THE REST OF THE EARLY VOTE WHICH HAS BEEN HEAVILY DEMOCRATIC. DO MORE REPUBLICANS JUST HAPPEN DO THAT ON ELECTION DAY. AND AGAIN, YOU WILL START TO SEE SOME OF THOSE BALLOTS TO FIND OUT. THERE IS ALSO ABOUT 7,000 OR SO PROVISIONAL BALLOTS FROM CLARK COUNTY, THOSE WILL BE COUNTED NEXT WEEK. BUT YOU DO IMAGINE THOSE WOULD FAVOR CORTEZ MASTO A LITTLE BIT, SO SHE MAY BE ABLE TO NET A COUPLE EXTRA THOUGHT OUT OF THAT. AND THEN THERE IS ALSO DOUGLAS COUNTY WHICH IS ONE OF THE RED COUNTIES HERE, VERY SMALL, BUT THEY HAVE TO REPORT TO. SO LAXALT COULD MAYBE NET ANOTHER 1,000 OR TWO OUT OF THAT. SO THIS IS A BIT OF A WILD CARD HERE. BUT I THINK THAT MASTO NEEDS TO BE GETTING ABOUT 60% OF THE REMAINING VOTE, YOU KNOW, GIVE OR TAKE OUT OF CLARK COUNTY. IF SHE CAN DO THAT, THAT MIGHT BE JUST ENOUGH TO PUT HER OVER LAXALT AND INTO THE LEAD STATEWIDE. A POSSIBILITY THERE. OF COURSE IT COULD BE SO CLOSE YOU COULD BE INTO RECOUNT TERRITORY. BUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OBVIOUSLY, REPUBLICANS NEED THIS ONE BADLY TO MAKE THAT DECEMBER 6 RUNOFF IN GEORGIA COUNT FOR SENATE CONTROL. IF DEMOCRATS GET THIS ONE, IF CORTEZ MASTO CAN PULL OUT NEVADA, THEN ALL DEMOCRATS NEED IS FOR MARK KELLY TO HANG ON IN ARIZONA. IF YOU ARE A KELLY SUPPORTER YOU ARE FEELING PRETTY GOOD ABOUT THIS BECAUSE HIS LEAD HAS BEEN GOING UP. TWO NIGHTS AGO, WE WERE HERE, IT WAS ABOUT 85,000, HE HAS SINCE ADDED 30,000 VOTES TO HIS STATEWIDE LEAD. WHY? MAINLY BECAUSE MAYOR COPY PA AND MARICOPA AND PIMA STILL HAD VOTES LEFT TO COUNT THAT FAVORED KELLY. THE STORY WILL BEGIN TO SHIFT WE BELIEVE TONIGHT IN ARIZONA BECAUSE FOR INSTANCE IN MARICOPA COUNTY, NEARLY 300,000, THEY ARE GIVING US THE NUMBER 290,000 BALLOTS VOTED OFF IN PERSON ON ELECTION DAY. AND IN 2020, THIS WAS A PRETTY HEAVILY REPUBLICAN BATCH OF VOTES. IN 2018, IT WASN'T. SO THERE IS SOME SUSPENSE HERE EXACTLY WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE. BUT IF YOU OPERATE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THIS WILL BE A PRETTY STRONGLY REPUBLICAN BATCH OF VOTES, KELLY MAY HAVE BANKED A BIG ENOUGH LEAD HERE, MAY HAVE BUILT UP A BIG ENOUGH LEAD WHERE MASTERS WOULD JUST NEED TO GET SUCH AN OBSCENE NUMBER WITH THIS 290,000. IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH EVEN IF HE IS DOING REALLY WELL SO ERASE THAT KIND OF LEAD STATEWIDE. SO FOR DEMOCRATS TO CONTROL THE U.S. SENATE WITHOUT EVEN NEEDING THAT GEORGIA RUNOFF, THEY ARE FEELING I WOULD SAY PRETTY GOOD ABOUT ARIZONA. NEVADA, THEY CERTAINLY HAVE A PATH. THEY WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE I'D SAY CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT NEVADA. WHERE DEMOCRATS MAYBE ARE FEELING VERY JITTERY THIS MORNING IS IN THE OTHER MARQUEE RACE IN ARIZONA. YOU SEE KELLY LEADING BY 115,000 IN THE SENATE RACE. VERY DIFFERENT STORY IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. DEMOCRAT KATIE HOBBS' LEAD OVER KARI LAKE IS UNDER 27,000 VOTES. WE'VE SEEN HOBBS CONTINUING TO RUN ABOUT 80,000 VOTES BEHIND KELLY'S LEVEL. AND AGAIN, THAT DYNAMIC THAT WE TALKED ABOUT, THAT 290,000 BALLOTS OR SO, IF THEY -- IT IS AN IF, BUT IF THEY ARE REPUBLICAN TO THE EXTENT THEY WERE OR SOMEWHERE AROUND THE EXTENT THEY WERE IN 2020, THAT IS GOING TO BE MORE THAN ENOUGH BALLOTS FOR KARI LAKE TO LEAP FROG KATIE HOBBS AND TAKE THE LEAD IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. AND SO THAT 290,000 IS CONSEQUENTIAL. OBVIOUSLY THERE IS CONTROL OF THE U.S. SENATE. BUT ALSO TO THIS GOVERNOR'S RACE IN ARIZONA.  SO FOR OUR INPATIENT VIEWERS, FAIR TO SAY THAT TONIGHT AROUND 10:00 PERHAPS ON A FRIDAY NIGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHERE ARIZONA IS HEADED?  YEAH, IT WAS ON THE DOT LAST NIGHT, 10:00 EASTERN TIME, WE GOT A BIG UPDATE OF 76,000 VOTES FROM MARICOPA COUNTY. WE'LL SEE IF THEY GIVE US GUIDANCE TODAY ON EXACT TIMING. BUT I THINK WHAT WE ARE GETTING TONIGHT IS FINALLY, I THINK FINALLY THAT MUCH -- YOU KNOW, THAT MUCH TALKED ABOUT 290,000 BALLOTS THAT WERE DROPPED OFF SAME DAY, I THINK THAT TONIGHT WE'LL GET -- I DON'T THINK THAT WE'LL GET ALL OF THEM, BUT A BIG CHUNK OF THEM AND I THINK THAT THAT CHUNK IS GOING TO TELL US IS THIS -- BECAUSE MASTERS IN THE SENATE RACE, MASTERS WILL NEED IT TO BE LIKE 70% REPUBLICAN, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND IF WE SEE A BATCH THAT IS 50/50 OR IF THE DEMOCRATS ARE ACTUALLY LEADING WITH THEM, WHICH WE STAU A COUPLE YEARS AGO, THEN I THINK THAT YOU WILL PRETTY CLEARLY SEE THAT MASTERS' PATH IS DRYING UP. COULD BE MORE COMPLICATED IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. AND AGAIN IF YOU ARE SEEING A HEAVILY REPUBLICAN VOTE 55%, 60%, YOU ARE PROBABLY SAYING THAT MASTERS WILL EAT INTO THAT KELLY MARGIN, BUT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OVERTAKE HIM. BUT AGAIN, IF YOU ARE SEEING THAT, YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE KARI LAKE OVERTAKING HOBBS IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE.  SO SET THE ALARM FOR 10:00 EASTERN AND COME BACK HERE. WE DON'T ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE RACE FOR SECRETARIES OF STATE, BUT THEY ARE CRUCIAL IN ARIZONA AND NEVADA BECAUSE YOU HAVE TWO PEOPLE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE WHO ARE ELECTION DENIERS. AND HAVE EXPRESSED SKEPTICISM ABOUT WHETHER THEY WOULD EVER ALLOW A DEMOCRAT TO WIN A RACE IN THE CASE OF MARK FINCHAM ANYWAY.  115,000 VOTE LEAD FOR MARK KELLY IN THE SENATE RACE. AND THE GOVERNOR'S RACE AS I SAID, KARI LAKE THE REPUBLICAN IS DOING BETTER HERE, SHE IS ONLY TRAILING BY 27,000 VOTES. I JUST TOOK YOU THROUGH HOW THAT COULD BE ENOUGH ULTIMATELY TO GET HER TO VICTORY. WE'LL SEE. NOW, HERE IS THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S RACE. THE REPUBLICAN, THIS LOOKS MORE LIKE THE SENATE RACE. SO DYNAMICS IN THE SENATE RACE RETAIN IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE RACE AS WELL. AND THEN AGAIN, YOU TAKE A LOOK HERE IN THE -- IN NEVADA, THE REPUBLICAN RUNNING FOR SECRETARY OF STATE THERE, HE ALREADY IS TRAILING THE DEMOCRAT IN THAT RACE BY 5300 VOTES. AGAIN, YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE SENATE RACE, IT IS CORTEZ MASTO WHO IS PLAYING CATCHUP THERE. SO AGAIN, THERE IS A SMALL DIFFERENCE THERE, YOU KNOW, THAT IS ABOUT IT AT 14,000, 15,000 VOTE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM, BUT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WE'RE ASKING CAN CORTEZ MASTO GET TO THE POINT WHERE SHE FINISHES A COUPLE THOUSAND VOTES OR MORE AHEAD OF LAXALT. ALREADY IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE RACE DEMOCRATS HAVE THE LEAD.  STEVE, WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT HOUSE RACES AND HOUSE CONTROL?  SO OUR MODEL MOVED TWICE YESTERDAY. AT THE START OF YESTERDAY, WE WERE PROJECTING THAT REPUBLICANS WOULD LAND AT 222 SEATS PLUS OR MINUS CRUCIAL PLUS OR MINUS SEVEN. THIS IS AN ESTIMATE. BUT IT MOVED TWICE YESTERDAY, CONTINUED DOWN TO 220 FOR THE REPUBLICANS. AGAIN, 218 IS THE MAGIC NUMBER FOR A PARTY TO GET A MAJORITY. WE NOW HAVE REPUBLICANS LANDING AT 220 PLUS OR MINUS SEVEN SEATS. MEANING THERE IS STILL AN OPPORTUNITY FOR REPUBLICANS TO PRESS THAT NUMBER UP INTO THE 220s, BUT ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DEMOCRATS TO GET TO 218 TO IT 2 19 TO JUST BARELY EEK OUT A MAJORITY. BIG THING THAT WILL DECIDE THIS IS CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THERE ARE JUST A BUNCH OF RACES IN CALIFORNIA WHICH TAKES -- THEY CALL IT ELECTION SEASON IN CALIFORNIA. IT WILL TAKE WEEKS IN SOME OF THESE PLACES TO GET CLARITY HERE. BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF IT, THESE ARE ALL THE UNCALLED RACES. SO DEMOCRATS NEED TO WIN THE BULK OF THESE IF THEY ARE GOING TO WIN THE HOUSE. BUT LOOK HOW MANY OF THEM. 12 OF THEM ARE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO DEMOCRATS -- WE COULD GO THROUGH THEM ONE BY ONE, BUT BASICALLY THERE IS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES HERE FOR DEMOCRATS, A LOT OF REALLY NARROW RACES OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA THAT NEED TO BREAK THEIR WAY. AND THEN THEY JUST NEED TO REALLY KIND OF SWEEP THROUGH CALIFORNIA. THAT IS THE KIND OF SCENARIO THAT COULD ACTUALLY GET THEM TO 218 OR 219. AGAIN, OUR MODEL THINKS THAT IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT DEMOCRATS WILL FALL LIKE THREE SEATS SHORT OF A MAJORITY AND THE IRONY OF THAT IS IF THAT DOES END UP BEING THE CASE, IF IT LANDS AT 220, WHERE DID DEMOCRATS SUFFER THEIR BIGGEST LOSSES, IT WAS IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  LONG ISLAND.  IT WAS LISTENING ISLAND AND IN THE CATSKILLS. THE DCCC. OVERSAW NATIONALLY AND UNBELIEVABLE NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS. NOBODY WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT FRIDAY AFTER THE ELECTION WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRATS HAVING TO PASS THE HOUSE CONTROL. THE GUY WHO OVERSAW THAT LOST HIS OWN SEAT IN NEW YORK. ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER DEMOCRATS. AND DEMOCRATS HAD EARLIER IN THE YEAR, THEY HAVE ALL THE POLITICAL POWER IN NEW YORK, THEY HAD EARLIER IN THE YEAR AGGRESSIVELY DRAWN A ON MANN MA OIG THAT GOT THROWN OUT BY THE JUDGE.  EXTRAORDINARY. EVERYONE TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF DEMOCRATS WINNING THE HOUSE GIVEN THE HEADWINDS AGAINST THEM. WE'LL CHECK BACK IN WITH YOU A LITTLE LATER. > AND DONNY DEUTSCH, A POINT AND A QUESTION. FIRST OF ALL, I DON'T KNOW WHEN -- MY MEAN, JOE BIDEN IS CONSTANTLY UNDERESTIMATED. CONSTANTLY. EVEN ON CABLE HOSTS INCLUDING PEOPLE ON OUR SHOW, CONSTANTLY SAYING IS HE TOO OLD. AND THE SNL, THEY DID A THING ABOUT JOE BIDEN. OH, MY GOD, WHAT IF HE -- YOU KNOW WHAT? JOE BIDEN SEEMS TO KNOW HIS POLITICS NO MATTER WHAT HIS AGE. HE FOCUSED ON DEMOCRACY AND ABORTION. HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING. BUT MY QUESTION TO YOU, THE POLLS, WHY WERE THEY SO WRONG?  HERE IS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE -- I WAS AFRAID OF A RED WAVE AND SO MANY OF US WERE. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR POLLS GOING FORWARD, EMOTION VERSUS LOGIC, GUT VERSUS HEAD, LEFT BRAIN VERSUS RIGHT BRAIN. WHEN YOU ASK QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE TO YOU, THAT IS KIND OF A LEFT BRAIN. IF YOU SAID TO PEOPLE WHAT ARE YOU MOST AFRAID OF, WHAT ARE YOU MOST OF A PHRASE OF, AND IF YOU SAY YOU'RE MOS AFRAID OF GAS PRICES STAYING HIGH OR ARE YOU MOST AFRAID OF NOT BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH YOUR BODY? ARE YOU MORE AFRAID OF PRICE OF LETTUCE STILL STAYING HIGH OR ARE YOU MORE AFRAID OF NOT BEING ABLE TO VOTE ANYMORE, THE DEMOCRACY ENDING? THOSE ARE EMOTIONS. AND I THINK THAT WE MISSED THINKING ABOUT THE GUT. AND IF I WAS THE CZAR OF POLAND GOING FORWARD, HOW DO YOU RETOOL YOUR QUESTIONS, HOW DO YOU GET INTO PEOPLE'S SOULS A BIT MORE VERSUS THE LEFT BRAIN. AND I THINK THAT THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE MISSING.  LIKE JANUARY 6, PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE INSURRECTIONISTS.  AND IF YOU SAY IS THE INSURRECTION IMPORTANT TO YOU, NOT NECESSARILY IMPORTANT, BUT WHAT IS DOWN HERE IN YOUR BELLY. AND SOMEHOW -- BECAUSE BASICALLY WE'VE BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS THE SAME WAY THE LAST 30 AND 40, 50 YEARS. SO THAT IS MY CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD. BUT IF YOU LOOK BACK NOW MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK ISSUES, YOU SAY WHAT ARE THE GUTTURAL ISSUES.  AND THEY MISSED A LOT OF THE YOUNG VOTERS WHO WON A LOT OF RACES FOR DEMOCRATS. THEY ARE NOT ANSWERING -- I MEAN, I SAID IT TONGUE IN CHEEK THE OTHER DAY, BUT I MEANT IT, THEY ARE NOT ANSWERING A SPAM PHONE CALL FOR SOMEBODY ASKING THEM ABOUT THEIR BELIEFS. AND THEN THEY WENT OUT AND VOTED IN DROVES THE OTHER NIGHT. AND WE'LL TALK TO THE HARVARD INSTITUTE FOR POLITICS ABOUT THAT. BUT JOINING US NOW, MAGGIE HASSAN WHO WAS SUCCESSFUL IN HER BID TO DEFEAT DONALD BOLDUC 53% TO 44%. SENATOR, GOOD MORNING, CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR WIN. WE HAD YOU ON HERE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WHEN THERE WAS A BIT OF FEAR AND LOATHING ABOUT YOUR RACE, PEOPLE WERE WORRIED THAT BOLDUC WAS PERHAPS GOING TO UNSEAT YOU UP THERE AND FLIP CONTROL OF THE SENATE. TURNS OUT YOU WIN IT GOING AWAY BY NINE POINTS. HOW DID YOU DO IT?  THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON, GUYS. AT THE END OF THE DAY, THIS IS ABOUT NEW HAMPSHIRE SAYING IN A VERY RESOUNDING WAY THAT THEY BELIEVE THAT COMMON SENSE IS IMPORTANT, THAT INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS ARE IMPORTANT, AND THAT DEMOCRACY IS IMPORTANT. AND WE PUT TOGETHER A REALLY STRONG AND ROBUST GRASS ROOTS CAMPAIGN THAT WE STARTED OVER A YEAR AGO JUST TALKING TO VOTERS WHERE THEY ARE, ABOUT WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT, AND ABOUT MY RECORD OF FOLLOWING THEIR EXAMPLE. WE HAVE A REAL TRADITION OF PUTTING ASIDE DIFFERENCES AND SOLVING PROBLEMS TOGETHER. THAT IS WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WORKED DO IN THE SENATE AND WE WERE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE WORK WE STILL NEED TO DO.  AND THE ISSUES THAT VOTERS SAY THAT THEY WERE INTERESTED IN, IT WAS INFLATION 36%, BUT ABORTION 35%. DID YOU GET A SENSE WHEN YOU WERE TALKING TO VOTERS AND ALL OF THOSE POLLS SAYING THAT IT WAS REALLY ALL ABOUT THE ECONOMY, WE HAD SEEN POLLS SAYING THAT 50% OF PEOPLE SAID THAT WAS THEIR NUMBER ONE ISSUE, WERE YOU GETTING A DIFFERENT PICTURE EVEN BEFORE THE VOTE ABOUT WHAT YOUR VOTERS WERE TELLING YOU REALLY MATTERED TO THEM?  I WAS GETTING THE STRONG SENSE THAT ALL OF THESE THINGS MATTER TO VOTERS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS ALL AT ONCE IN THEIR LIVES. SO INFLATION IS HURTING WAY TOO MANY FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES IN MY STATE. IT IS CERTAINLY AN ISSUE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON, BUT I WAS ABLE TO TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT HOW WE'RE TRYING TO LOWER THE COSTS. WE CAN RIGHT NOW. THAT IS WHERE THE MEDICARE NEGOTIATION FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES COMES IN. IT IS WHY I'M FOCUSED SO HARD ON LOWERING HOME HEATING COSTS RIGHT NOW IN THE NORTHEAST AND I DID IN-TO PUSH THE ADMINISTRATION ON STEPS IT CAN TAKE. IT IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE TO PUSH TO SUSPEND THE GAS TAX WHILE PRICES ARE SO HIGH. BUT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THEIR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOMS. I REMEMBER ONE OF OUR ORGANIZERS SAYING THAT THEY HAD KNOCKED ON THE DOOR TO TALK TO A MAN ABOUT MY AGE I GUESS, MID-60s OR SO, AND WHEN THEY ASKED HIM WHAT WAS IMPORTANT TO HIM, HE PULLED HIS 8-YEAR-OLD GRANDDAUGHTER NEXT TO HIM AND SAID SHE IS. AND I'M VOTING FOR HER. AND TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE DIDN'T GO BACK TO A TIME WHERE WOMEN ARE SECOND CLASS CITIZENS. SO PEOPLE ARE DEALING WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS ALL AT ONCE. AND AS THE ELECTION UNFOLDED AND WE GOT CLOSER AND CLOSER TO ELECTION DAY, I ALSO BEGAN TO HEAR MORE AND MORE ABOUT PEOPLE BEING CONCERNED ABOUT PROTECTING DEMOCRACY.  MAGGIE HASSON OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND THANKS FOR COMING ON THIS MORNING. > HOUSE LEADER KEVIN McCARTHY IS MAKING PLANS FOR HIS PARTY TO TAKE OVER CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. BUT IN THE END, HE MAY NOT BE THE ONE CALLING THE SHOTS. FOLLOWING A MEETING OF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS YESTERDAY, SEVERAL REPUBLICANS SUGGESTED THAT THEY WILL NOT SUPPORT McCARTHY'S BID FOR HOUSE SPEAKER.  KEVIN McCARTHY HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING TO EARN MY VOTE. I THINK THAT THERE IS A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE REPUBLICAN CONFERENCE WHO SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS, SO I EXPECT THERE TO BE A CHALLENGE.  I THINK THERE IS SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT LEADERSHIP IN A TIME WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A MASSIVE RED WAVE.  WILL YOU SUPPORT McCARTHY FOR SPEAKER?  WE'RE SUPPORTING FOLKS FOR LEADERSHIP THAT ARE GOING TO EMPOWER MEMBERS.  WITH THE MARGINS IN THE LOWER CHAMBER EXPECTED TO BE RAZOR THIN, THE NEXT SPEAKER WILL NEED YEA VOTES FROM VIRTUALLY EVERY HOUSE REPUBLICAN. LET'S BRING IN THE EDITOR OF THE NEW REPUBLIC RIGHT NOW, AND MICHAEL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON THE SHOW THIS MORNING. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF DIVISION WITHIN THESE HOUSE MEMBERS OF REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND KEVIN McCARTHY'S POTENTIAL LOSS OF THE SPEAKER SHIP?  THAT NBC REPORT WHICH I READ THIS MORNING WAS REALLY FASCINATING BECAUSE IT IS REALLY RARE I THINK TO SEE MEMBERS OF A LEADER'S OWN CAUCUS SPEAK PUBLICLY IN FRONT OF CAMERAS THE WAY THOSE TWO DID ABOUT HOW THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THE GUY. AND MAKES YOU WONDER HOW MUCH MORE SENTIMENT WITHIN THE CAUCUS THEY REPRESENT. LET'S TALK ABOUT THE PROCESS. YOU TOUCHED ON IT, AND IT IS AN IMPORTANT POINT. NEXT WEEK THERE IS A VOTE IN THE CAUCUS, AND THAT IS A NONBINDING VOTE THAT McCARTHY WILL PROBABLY DO FINE IN. BUT THE REAL VOTE IS JANUARY 3 WHEN THE NEW CONGRESS CONVENES. NOW, ASSUMING THE REPUBLICANS HAVE THE MAJORITY, WHICH IS NOT AN ASSUMPTION WE SHOULD REALLY MAKE AT THIS POINT, BUT ODDS STILL FAVOR THAT PROBABLY BY THREE SEATS, FOUR SEATS, FIVE SEATS, HE WILL NEED AS YOU SAID EVERY SINGLE MEMBER OF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS TO BE WITH HIM. BECAUSE HE IS OBVIOUSLY NOT GOING TO GET ANY DEMOCRATIC VOTES. SO THAT MEANS THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTRACT A PRETTY BIG PRICE FROM HIM AS TO WHAT HIS AGENDA IS GOING TO BE. THEY WILL HAVE LEVERAGE OVER HIM, IN OTHER WORDS, SIMILAR TO THE KIND OF LEVERAGE THAT JOE MANCHIN AND KYRSTEN SINEMA HAD OVER JOE BIDEN FOR HIS FIRST COUPLE YEARS. SO NOT ONLY DOES IT PRESENT THE POSSIBILITY THAT McCARTHY MIGHT NOT EVEN BE THE SPEAKER IF THEY REVOLT, BUT IT ALSO TELLS US THAT IF HE DOES SETTLE THEM DOWN AND MAKE DEALS AND GET THEIR VOTES, IT IS JUST GOING TO BE A TUMULTUOUS TRAIN WRECK OF A TWO YEARS.  YEAH, CLEARLY THE FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBERS IF HE IS SPEAKER WILL EXTRACT A LOT FROM HIM. IF YOU WANT TO BE SPEAKER, YOU BETTER START THE IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS STRAIGHT AWAY. IF NOT McCARTHY, STEVE SCALISE IS A CHOICE. WHO ELSE IS OUT THERE?  I DON'T KNOW ABOUT SCALISE. SCALISE HAS BEEN A PRETTY LOYAL McCARTHY LIEUTENANT. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT JIM JUROR -- JIM JORDAN OF OHIO. I THINK A LOT OF THEM FOLLOW HIM. AND HE IS ONE THIS McCARTHY HAS CURRIED FAVOR WITH. SO HE HAS A RELATIONSHIP WITH JORDAN. A NAME I HEARD WAS JIM BANKS. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH CREDIBILITY TO PUT IN THAT. BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THERE ARE OTHER FREEDOM CAUCUS NAMES THAT YOU MIGHT HEAR. BUT I THINK THAT THAT IS KIND OF A PRETTY OPEN QUESTION AT THIS POINT.  AND SO I'LL ASK YOU THE QUESTION WE'VE BEEN ASKING THIS MORNING. YOU SEE SOME MEDIA ENTITIES THAT WERE VERY PRO TRUMP TO SAY THE LEAST KIND OF MOVING AWAY FROM HIM. YOU SEE SOME REPUBLICANS BEING OUTSPOKEN OF THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA SAYING FLAT OUT SHE CANNOT SUPPORT HIM. THE VOTERS HAVE SPOKEN IN TOO MANY WAYS IN TOO MANY ELECTIONS. DOES DONALD TRUMP ANNOUNCE HIS BID FOR THE PRESIDENCY NEXT WEEK WITH THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY?  WELL, I THINK THAT HE MAKES THE ANNOUNCEMENT. HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T MAKE IT WITH THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW, LET'S NOT JUMP TO RASH CONCLUSIONS HERE ABOUT THE OTHER REPUBLICAN PARTY BEING DONE WITH TRUMP. A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING OUT. THE VIRGINIA LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, MOST NOTABLY. I MEAN, HER WORDS WERE THE MOST FORCEFUL. AND A HANDFUL OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE SAYING THINGS. BUT THEN, YOU KNOW, ELISE STEFANIK AND MATT GAETZ SAYING NO, WE'RE STILL A TRUMP PARTY. HERSCHEL WALKER OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T BE WHERE HE IS WITHOUT DONALD TRUMP. I DON'T THINK THAT RUPERT MURDOCH WILL CALL THIS SHOT. I DON'T THINK THAT THE RIGHT WING MEDIA WILL CALL THIS SHOT. CAN I DON'T THINK THAT MITCH McCONNELL WILL CALL THIS SHOT. I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY THE BASE WILL CALL THIS SHOT. AND MURDOCH WILL FOLLOW WHAT THE BASE WANTS. DON'T FORGET, MURDOCH HAD A FEUD WITH TRUMP IN 2015 OVER THOSE THINGS HE SAID ABOUT MEGYN KELLY. AND THERE WAS ALLEGEDLY A WAR BETWEEN TRUMP LAND AND FOX LAND, YOU KNOW, AFTER THAT. BUT THAT GOT SORTED OUT. YOU KNOW, THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO DUMP HIM, UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY, NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE HIS CANDIDATES DID SO POORLY. BUT I THINK THAT WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHETHER TRUMP STILL HAS THAT HOLD OVER THE BASE BECAUSE IF HE DOES, I THINK THAT THEY WILL FOLLOW.  MICHAEL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMING ON THIS MORNING. WE APPRECIATE IT. DONNY DEUTSCH, THANK YOU AS WELL. I NEED YOU BACK UP WITH BRAND UP BRAND DOWN.  WE'LL DO THAT NEXT WEEK. I THINK THAT WE SHOULD DO AN EATING EDITION.  WOULD IT BE EDGIER?  JUST A VARIETY. YOU ARE STARTING TO GO MORE NIGHTTIME.  \"MORNING JOE\" AT NIGHT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?  I DON'T THINK FOUR HOURS IS ENOUGH.  LET'S DO FIVE HOURS.  A FULL HOUR BEHIND THE SCENES OF \"MORNING JOE,\" I THINK IT SHOULD BE AT HOME WITH \"MORNING JOE.\"  AND YOU COULD TEACH US COOKING.  I THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE MORE --  GRILL TIPS, THINGS LIKE THAT.  YES. MAYBE A FIFTH HOUR. I'LL PONDER IT. > STILL AHEAD ON \"MORNING JOE,\" FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP MAKES UNFOUNDED CLAIMS OF A CORRUPT VOTING SYSTEM IN NEVADA. AND THE OFFICIALS IN CLARK COUNTY WERE NOT HAVING IT. WE'LL GET A LIVE REPORT FROM LAS VEGAS. AND ALSO FROM ARIZONA WHERE WE'RE AWAITING RESULTS THIS MORNING. WE'RE AWAITING RESULTS THIS MORNING. 20221111132441.842|20221111132852.659",

ECONOMIC RELATIONS OF COURSE, BUT ALSO EXPECT PRESIDENT BIDEN TO DELIVER A MESSAGE OF WARNING ABOUT CHINA AGGRESSION TO TAIWAN. BUT HE HAS TO TREAD DELICATELY BECAUSE HE WANTS XI JINPING'S HELP ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES INCLUDING FURTHER ISOLATING PUTIN AND ALSO POTENTIALLY KIM JUNG-UN WHO HAS RAMPED UP ROCKET TESTS.  KATTY KAY.  YEAH, SO THEY WILL MEET FACE-TO-FACE FOR THE FIRST TIME AND OBVIOUSLY ALL OF THE COVID POLICY. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING THERE HAS BEEN ALMOST NO COMMUNICATION, BILATERAL COMMUNICATION, BETWEEN THE AMERICANS AND WHICH I SNEEZE THE LAST TWO YEARS. WHAT IS THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT THEY NEED TO OUT? WHAT IS MOST URGENT? IS IT TAIWAN? IS IT TRADE? WHAT'S THE STICKING POINT?  THE SHORT ANSWER IS ALL OF THE ABOVE. YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE'S BEEN A TOTAL BREAKDOWN IN COMMUNICATIONS AFTER SPEAKER PELOSI'S VISIT TO TAIWAN. THOSE CONVERSATIONS WERE ONLY REVIVED THIS PARTICULAR MEETING. XI JINPING AND PRESIDENT BIDEN HAVE SPOKEN A COUPLE TIMES ON THE PHONE, NOT OFTEN. THEY HAD BIT OF RELATIONSHIP WHEN BIDEN WAS VICE PRESIDENT AND XI JINPING WAS SECONDARY IN HIS GOVERNMENT AS WELL. THE STAKES ARE HIGHER NOW. TRADE POLICY, TAIWAN BIG, INCLUDING TO PUSH CHINA TO NOT HELP OUT RUSSIA TOO MUCH WITH THEIR WAR. IT SHOULD BE UNDERSCORED HOW MIKA BROUGHT IN THIS SEGMENT, THE PRESIDENT COMES HERE EMBOLDENED WITH A MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED MIDTERMS FOR HIS PARTY AND ONE HE PUT DEMOCRACY ON THE BALLOT. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT, WHITE HOUSE AIDES HAVE BEEN TELLING ME, FOR HIM TO MAKE THAT ARGUMENT AT HOME, HAVE A LOT OF BIG-LIE CANDIDATES WIN, THEN COME OVERSEAS AND LOOK THESE LEADERS IN THE FACE AND SAY, LOOK, AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS WORKING. IT'S MUCH EASIER FOR HIM TO DO THAT NOW BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE SIGNIFICANT ELECTION DENIERS LOST AND BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP APPEARS WEAKENED BECAUSE SO MANY ALLIES OVERSEAS HAVE BEEN SO WORRIED ABOUT A POSSIBLE TRUMP RETURN IN 2024.  JONATHAN LEMIRE REPORTING FOR US FROM CAMBODIA. THANK YOU. TO HIS POINT, THE PRESIDENT WAS VERY HAPPY AFTER THE MIDTERMS AND A LOT OF NUMBERS OF THE MEDIA BUT ALSO ANALYSTS WERE, LIKE, HE'S FOCUSED ON DEMOCRACY TOO, PHILOSOPHICAL, FOCUSED ON ABORTION, THAT'S NOT WHAT HE'S POLLING. THAT'S WHAT HE FOCUSED ON AND ONCE AGAIN, UNDERESTIMATED JOE BIDEN, THAT'S WHAT TURNED OUT WAS IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE.  HE WAS WILLING LECTURED ON ELECTION DAY.  IT HAPPENED HERE. THERE WAS A CONCERN. NEED TO TALK ABOUT CRIME. JOE SAID YOU NEED TO TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING, BUT I HEARD A LOT OF VOICES SAYING THE PRESIDENT IS SO FOCUSED ON DEMOCRACY, ON ABORTION. YES. HE HAD HIS FINGER ON THE PULSE AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT. A LOT OF THE POLLING DIDN'T.  YEAH. ABORTION, PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, NUMBER-ONE ISSUE. BY WIDE MARGINS. HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT, AT LEAST. > NEW THIS MORNING, THE RUSSIAN DEFENSE MINISTRY SAYS IT IS FINISHED PULLING ITS TROOPS OUT OF THE WEST BANK OF THE DNIPRO RIVER IN THE CITY OF KHERSON. JOINING US NOW, JAMES DEBREEDS, FORMER COMMANDER OF NATO. GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. THIS LOOKS LIKE A HEADLINE, RUSSIA IN RETREAT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN KHERSON, UKRAINE PUSHING THEM BACK, MOVING INTO SOME OF THESE TERRITORIES. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING ON THE BATTLEFIELD RIGHT NOW?  IT'S A REALLY GOOD DAY IN KYIV. LET'S ALSO PICK UP THE POINT YOU JUST MADE, WHICH IS VLADIMIR PUTIN ESSENTIALLY AFRAID TO GO TO THE G-20. HE CAN'T LOOK PRESIDENT XI, HIS BEST FRIEND FOREVER, IN THE EYE. REMEMBER, THESE TWO LOOKED EACH OTHER IN THE EYE RIGHT BEFORE THE OLYMPICS. PUTIN WAS FLYING HIGH. I SUSPECT HE TOLD XI, LOOK, THIS THING WILL BE OVER IN FIVE DAYS, I'LL BE IN KYIV. HERE WE ARE 8 1/2 MONTHS LATER AND THE UKRAINIANS ARE ABOUT TO TAKE BACK THE LAST REMAINING BIG CITY THAT THE RUSSIANS WERE ABLE TO CAPTURE. SO, THIS IS, AGAIN, A VERY GOOD DAY IN KYIV. HAVING SAID ALL THAT, WILLIE, DON'T COUNT VLADIMIR PUTIN OUT YET. HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE CARPET BOMBING, CONTINUE RELYING ON IRAN FOR MORE HIGH-TECH EQUIPMENT. HE MIGHT PLAY A CYBER CARD. HE MIGHT DO, GOD FORBID, SOMETHING WITH A WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION. HE COULD ORDER A FULL MOBILIZATION. HE COULD ENERGIZE THE BLACK SEA FLEET AND USE IT MORE EFFECTIVELY. ABOVE ALL, HE'LL BE WATCHING EUROPE, AND CAN THEY HOLD TOGETHER WITH HIGH ENERGY PRICES IN A COLD WINTER. I THINK THEY CAN. I DON'T LIKE HIS HAND OF CARDS. BUT HE'S STILL GOT CARDS TO PLAY. OVERALL, GOOD DAY IN KYIV.  YEAH. ADMIRAL TO YOUR POINT, KYIV IS NOT CELEBRATING THE WAY OTHERS MIGHT BE. THEY'RE MOVING WITH CAUTION, WORD THIS COULD BE A STRATEGY FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN. BUT TO YOUR POINT, WHEN YOU HAVE A MAN IN VLADIMIR PUTIN WHO THOUGHT IN FIVE DAYS THEY'D BE IN KYIV AND THEY'D BE HAVING A PARADE AND INSTALLING A PUPPET REGIME, THIS HAS COMPLETELY BLOWN UP IN HIS FACE. WHAT HAPPENS FROM HERE IN YOUR ESTIMATION? HOW LONG CAN PRESIDENT PUTIN KEEP THIS UP?  WELL, TO YOUR POINT ABOUT BLOWING UP IN HIS FACE, HIS GENERALS TOLD HIM DON'T WORRY, PRESIDENT PUTIN, OUR TROOPS WILL BE GREETED WITH BOTTLES OF VODKA. THEY WERE GREETED WITH BOTTLES OF FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS CALLED MOLOTOV COCKTAILS. THIS IS A DEBACLE UNFOLDING FOR RUSSIA. HOW IT ENDS UP I THINK IS THINGS WILL STEADY DOWN BECAUSE OF WINTER, BECAUSE BOTH SIDES ARE GOING TO BE NOT QUITE FROZEN IN PLACE, BUT MANEUVERING IS DIFFICULT. YOU'LL SEE AIR ATTACKS OUT OF RUSSIA. WE'LL GET THROUGH THE WINTER. THE EUROPEANS WILL HOLD TOGETHER. I THINK THEN, WILLIE, ASSUMING WE CONTINUE TO STAND WITH UKRAINE, AND I THINK WE WILL, THE U.S., THE WEST, THEN I THINK YOU HAVE THE CONDITIONS FOR SOME KIND OF NEGOTIATE COMING OUT OF THE WINTER. THAT'S LONG WAY AWAY, A LOT OF TWISTS AND TURNS. THAT'S I THINK THE BEST WE CAN HOPE FOR AT THIS MOMENT. > COMING UP, A RECORD 12 WOMEN WILL SERVE AS GOVERNORS IN 2023.

THOSE CONVERSATIONS ONLY REVIVED TO PLAN THIS PARTICULAR MEETING. XI JINPING AND PRESIDENT BIDEN HAVE SPOKEN A COUPLE OF TIMES ON THE PHONE, NOT OFTEN.

YES, HE HAD HIS FINGER ON THE PULSE, AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE RIGHT, AND A LOT OF THE POLLING DIDN'T.  YEAH, ABORTION IN PENNSYLVANIA, MICHIGAN, NUMBER ONE ISSUE. IN FACT, BY WIDE MARGINS.

JOINING US IS FOUR STAR ADMIRAL JAMES STAVRIDIS, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANALYST, AND SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER OF NATO. GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US THIS MORNING. THIS DOES LOOK AGAIN LIKE A HEADLINE, RUSSIA IN RETREAT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN KHERSON, UKRAINE PUSHING THEM BACK, MOVING INTO TERRITORIES. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING ON THE BATTLEFIELD RIGHT NOW?  IT'S A REALLY GOOD DAY IN KYIV. LET'S PICK UP THE POINT YOU JUST MADE, WHICH IS VLADIMIR PUTIN ESSENTIALLY AFRAID TO GO TO THE G20. HE CAN'T LOOK PRESIDENT XI, HIS BEST FRIEND FOREVER IN THE EYE. REMEMBER THESE TWO LOOKED EACH OTHER IN THE EYE RIGHT BEFORE THE OLYMPICS. PUTIN WAS FLYING HIGH.

CAN THEY HOLD TOGETHER WITH HIGH ENERGY PRICES AND A COLD WINTER. I THINK THEY CAN. I DON'T LIKE HIS HAND OF CARDS, BUT HE'S GOT CARDS TO PLAY. OVERALL A GOOD DAY IN KYIV.  TO YOUR POINT, KYIV IS SORT OF NOT CELEBRATING THE WAY OTHERS MIGHT BE ABOUT THIS NEWS OUT OF KHERSON. THEY'VE MOVING WITH CAUTION WORRIED THIS COULD BE SOME KIND OF A STRATEGY FROM VLADIMIR PUTIN, BUT TO YOUR POINT, WHEN YOU HAVE A MAN IN VLADIMIR PUTIN WHO THOUGHT IN FIVE DAYS HE WOULD BE IN KYIV AND THEY WOULD BE HAVING A PARADE AND INSTALLING A PUPPET REGIME THERE, BOY, THIS IS COMPLETELY BLOWN UP IN HIS FACE. SO WHAT HAPPENS FROM HERE IN YOUR ESTIMATION? HOW LONG CAN PUTIN KEEP THIS UP?  WELL, TO YOUR POINT ABOUT BLOWING UP IN HIS FACE, YOU KNOW, HIS GENERALS TOLD HIM DON'T WORRY, PRESIDENT PUTIN, OUR TROOPS WILL BE GREETED WITH BOTTOMS OF VODKA. THEY WERE GREETED WITH FLAMMABLE LIQUIDS CALLED MOLOTOV COCKTAILS. SO THIS REALLY IS A DEBACLE UNFOLDING FOR RUSSIA. HOW IT ENDS UP, I THINK, IS THINGS WILL STEADY DOWN BECAUSE OF WINTER, BECAUSE BOTH SIDES ARE GOING TO BE NOT QUITE FROZEN IN PLACE BUT DEEPLY DIFFICULT. YOU'LL SEE A LOT OF AIR ATTACKS OUT OF RUSSIA. WE'LL GET THROUGH THE WINTER, THE EUROPEANS WILL HOLD TOGETHER. I THINK THEN, WILLIE, ASSUMING WE CONTINUE TO STAND WITH UKRAINE, AND I THINK WE WILL. THE BIG WE, THE U.S., THE WEST, THEN I THINK YOU'VE GOT THE CONDITIONS FOR SOME KIND OF NEGOTIATION COMING OUT OF THE WINTER. THAT'S A LONG WAY AWAY. A LOT OF TWISTS AND TURNS. THAT'S, I THINK, THE BEST WE CAN HOPE FOR AT THIS MOMENT.  SO DAVID IGNATIUS HAS A NEW COLUMN IN THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" ENTITLED RUSSIA IS IN RETREAT IN EVERY MAJOR INTERNATIONAL FORUM, AND HE WRITES IN PART THIS. AS RUSSIA'S MILITARY TROUBLES MOUNT IN UKRAINE, IT'S ALSO BECOMING MORE ISOLATED INTERNATIONALLY. AS ORGANIZATIONS AFFILIATED WITH THE UNITED NATIONS, PURGE RUSSIA'S REPRESENTATIVES FROM LEADERSHIP POSITIONINGS. THIS HAS ACCELERATED IN RECENT MONTHS. IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE WAY THE UKRAINE WAR IS REALIGNING THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM INTO A SMALL BLOCK SUPPORTING THE KREMLIN AND A LARGER GROUP BACKING THE UNITED STATES AND ITS BROAD COALITION OF ALLIES. THE RUSSIAN MILITARY HAS MADE SOME STUNNING MISTAKES ON THE BATTLEFIELD IN KYIV, KHARKIV, AND NOW KHERSON. BUT RUSSIA'S DIPLOMATS MAY HAVE FEARED EVEN WORSE. RUSSIA IS IN RETREAT IN EVERY MAJOR INTERNATIONAL FORUM. PUTIN IMAGINED THIS WAR WOULD BRING HIM GREATER GLOBAL INFLUENCE. IT HAS INSTEAD BEEN AN EPIC DISASTER. SO ADMIRAL, PUTIN MAY HAVE CARDS TO PLAY, BUT THE WALLS ALSO INTERNATIONALLY SEEM TO BE CLOSING IN.  I THINK THAT'S SMART ANALYSIS, AS ALWAYS, BY OUR COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND, DAVID IGNATIUS. YOU KNOW THAT DISTANT BOOM YOU HEAR IS VLADIMIR PUTIN'S HEAD EXPLODING. THIS HAS GONE SO BADLY, AND BY THE WAY, I'LL ADD TO THE LIST DAVID GAVE US, SWEDEN AND FINLAND JOINING NATO, STRENGTHENING THE ALLIANCE. BULKING UP THAT NORTHERN FLANK, AND THE LIST REALLY GOES ON AND ON. IT'S APPROACHING THE POINT WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE WORK TO KEEP THE LINES OF COMMUNICATION OPEN WITH RUSSIA. IT'S VERY TEMPTING TO DO HIGH FIVES AND BOX HIM INTO THE CORNER. WE NEED TO KEEP TALKING TO THE RUSSIANS, WE NEED TO FIND WAYS ULTIMATELY TO NEGOTIATE AN ENDING TO THIS WAR. IN SOME WAYS, MIKA, WE OUGHT TO BE GROWING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT RUSSIAN WEAKNESS AS OPPOSED TO RUSSIAN STRENGTH BECAUSE OF THAT NUCLEAR ARSENAL. SO, YES, EVERYTHING DAVID SAYS IS RIGHT.  FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER LOSING THE AUDIO THERE A LITTLE BIT. JAMES STAVRIDIS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING ON THIS MORNING. > AND STILL AHEAD ON \"MORNING JOE,\" LIVE REPORTING FROM ARIZONA AND NEVADA WHERE A NUMBER OF KEY RACES ARE STILL TOO EARLY TO CALL THIS MORNING. > PLUS, STEVE KORNACKI WILL BE AT THE BIG BOARD. > ALSO AHEAD, DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MAGGIE HASSAN WILL JOIN US AFTER WINNING REELECTION IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BY A WIDE MARGIN. \"MORNING JOE\" WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

THEY WANT TO TAKE THE AIR OUT OF THIS MOVEMENT, AND THEY CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE IT'S A MOVEMENT, AND WE THE PEOPLE ARE FED UP AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO SLOW DOWN. WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THEM TAKE THE FIRE OUT OF OUR BELLY. AND SO THEY SLOW ROLL THE RESULTS, YOU KNOW, RON DeSANTIS GOES OUT, GIVES HIS BIG SPEECH AND THEY WANT TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THE TRUMP REPUBLICANS DON'T HAVE A CHANCE. WE DO. WE'RE GOING TO WIN. I'M 100% SURE OF THAT. I THINK THAT BLAKE MAY EVEN WIN.  AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO SEES THIS. SHE IS SO TRUMPY THAT TRUMP IS MAD AT DeSANTIS, CALLS HIM DESANCTIMONIOUS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT REALLY MEANT.  IT'S AN INCOHERENT ARGUMENT.  SHE JUST PUT HIS NAME IN THERE.  HAD TO GO AFTER HIM A LITTLE BIT. HIGH SCHOOL. > ARIZONA'S REPUBLICAN GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE KARI LAKE IN AN INTERVIEW YESTERDAY SEEMING TO CONNECT RON DeSANTIS WITH UNFOUNDED CLAIMS OF ELECTION FRAUD. WHAT'S GOING ON? AM I RIGHT OR IS THERE SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON HERE DAVID JOLLY.  WELCOME TO REPUBLICANS IN DISARRAY. THIS GOES TO THE PREMISE OF THE EARLIER CONVERSATION, THIS NOTION THAT THEY'RE GOING TO QUICKLY GET PAST DONALD TRUMP OR THIS RAPID COORDINATION OF RON DeSANTIS IS NOT HAPPENING. HERE'S WHY. IN THE LAST 72 HOURS, KARI LAKE HAS THROWN HER LOYALTY TO DONALD TRUMP. MATT GAETZ SAID DONALD TRUMP IS THE NEXT CANDIDATE. ARE YOU SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP OR NOT, AND THE PROBLEM IS, LOOK, SOME OF THEM WILL DO IT OUT OF FEALTY AND LOYALTY AND CRAZINESS, THAT'S THE KARI LAKE PLAY. THE OTHERS LIKE RICK SCOTT WILL DO IT BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO.  DON'T YOU THINK SOME WILL SEE, WOW, THIS IS OUR GET AWAY CAR, LIKE I DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS ANYMORE.  THE STENCH AND STAIN OF TRUMPISM LIVES WITH THESE REPUBLICANS. IT'S NOT AS EASY AS JUST SAYING I TOOK A SHOWER AND IT'S GONE.  ADRIENNE ELROD, THE OTHER PART OF THIS IS THE VOTERS. A LOT OF FOLKS WERE WRONG ABOUT WHAT MATTERED TO THEM. DEMOCRACY DID MATTER. JOE BIDEN WAS RIGHT.  YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. A COUPLE OF THINGS, MIKA. NUMBER ONE, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S AGENDA IS INCREDIBLY POPULAR. WE SAW THAT PLAY OUT TUESDAY NIGHT. TO YOUR POINT, ABORTION, PEOPLE ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT PROTECTING THEIR RIGHT TO ACCESS TO ABORTION, NOT JUST WOMEN BUT A LOT OF MEN OUT THERE TOO. THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO THEM. AND ANYONE WHO SAID THAT DEMOCRACY DOESN'T MATTER TO VOTERS, PROTECTING THE PILLARS OF DEMOCRACY DOESN'T MATTER, IT TURNS OUT IS ACTUALLY DOES. SO I THINK PRESIDENT BIDEN GOING OUT THERE MAKING THE BIG SPEECH ABOUT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR SYSTEMS. ALMOST EVERY ELECTION DENIER RUNNING FOR MAJOR OFFICE HAS LOST. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN THE ARIZONA GOVERNOR'S RACE. THAT IS CERTAINLY A FAR MORE TIGHTER RACE REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME THAN WE EVER IMAGINED. YOU SEE KARI LAKE GOING OUT THERE AND SORT OF USING HER SAME SPIEL, THEY'RE TRYING TO TAKE AWAY MY WIN BY SLOWLY COUNTING THE VOTES. VOTERS DON'T BUY THAT, AND WE ALSO SAW INDEPENDENT VOTERS BREAK HEAVILY FOR DEMOCRATS THIS CYCLE. OF COURSE IF REPUBLICANS WANT TO WIN THE PRESIDENCY IN 2024, WHETHER IT'S DONALD TRUMP, RON DeSANTIS, WHOMEVER IT IS, THEY HAVE TO GET BACK THOSE INDEPENDENT VOTERS, AND INDEPENDENT VOTERS ARE NOT BUYING ANY SORT OF ELECTION DENIALISM. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THEY SUPPORT. A LOT OF TAKE AWAYS FROM TUESDAY NIGHT WHICH I KNOW WE'LL BE UNPACKING FOR A WHILE, BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW FOR A FACT IS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT THE PILLARS OF DEMOCRACY TO BE PROTECTED.  YEAH, JUST TO GO BACK A MINUTE TO KARI LAKE'S COMMENT, THE DeSANTIS PIECE OF IT, GRATUITOUSLY THREW HIS NAME IN, DOESN'T GET TO THE ARGUMENT BUT TO GET TO THE POINT ABOUT HER DENIALISM AND CASTING DOUBT ON THE RESULTS AND OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION, YOU INTERVIEWED HER I KNOW OVER THE SUMMER, AND I THINK TRIED OR MAYBE ULTIMATELY DID GET TO THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF THIS, WHICH IS DOES SHE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS STUFF. SHE'S A SMART WOMAN. SHE'S CAMPAIGNED WELL. SHE'S EARNED A LOT OF VOTES OUT THERE. DOES SHE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THE 2020 ELECTION WAS STOLEN? DOES SHE ACTUALLY BELIEVE THIS TIME AROUND THAT, WELL, THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS, WHY IS THE VOTE TAKING SO LONG. SHE KNOWS WHY IT'S TAKING LONG. IT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR. MAIL-IN VOTES AND EVERYTHING ELSE. DOES SHE BELIEVE THIS STUFF?  I WROTE ABOUT THIS QUESTION IN THE BBC THIS MORNING. I WENT INTO MY INTERVIEW WITH HER, I SPENT A DAY WITH HER AT A CAMPAIGN EVENT HOSTED IN A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY A COUPLE OF HOURS OUTSIDE OF PHOENIX. IT'S A MASTER CLASS IN RETAIL POLITICS. SHE'S REALLY GOOD. ALL OF THOSE YEARS ON CAMERA AS A TV ANCHOR HAVE SERVED HER WELL. SHE WENT IN WITH GUSHING COMPLIMENTS ABOUT EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM. SHE HAD THEM EATING OUT OF HER HANDS, AND YET HER MESSAGE IS VERY HARD CORE, KIND OF FAR ON THE RIGHT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. I WENT INTO THAT INTERVIEW EXACTLY WANTING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, DOES SHE BELIEVE IT, SOMEBODY WHO SPENT 22 YEARS AS A TV ANCHOR IN THE NEWS BUSINESS, IS SHE JUST SPINNING THIS FOR POLITICAL GAIN. I CAME OUT NONE THE WISER TO BE HONEST. MY LUNCH IS SHE DOESN'T BECAUSE I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SOMEBODY WHO HAS DEALT IN FACTS FOR THAT LONG AS A BUSINESS WOULD REALIZE, WOULD BELIEVE SOMETHING FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO FACTS, BUT YOU WOULD NEVER GET HER TO CONCEDE ANY CHINK IN HER DENIALISM. ALL THE REPUBLICAN VIEWS THAT FOUND THERE WAS NO FRAUD, THE LOCAL COUNTIES THAT HAVE FOUND THAT THERE IS NO FRAUD, NOTHING, SHE JUST SAYS, THERE IS EVIDENCE, THERE IS EVIDENCE, SAID EVIDENCE IS YET TO BE PRODUCED. SHE INSISTS THAT IT'S THERE SOMEWHERE. WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS. SHE SAYS IT'S THERE SOMEWHERE. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER SHE BELIEVES IT OR NOT, AND I'M NOT SURE THAT'S THE POINT BECAUSE NOW MILLIONS OF HER SUPPORTERS DO, AND WE'RE SEEING THAT PLAY OUT IN THIS CAMPAIGN.  PEGGY NOONAN WRITES FOR THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL,\" A PIECE THAT THE ENTITLED \"MAYBE REPUBLICANS WILL FINALLY LEARN,\" SHE WRITES IN PART, IF IN 2024 REPUBLICANS AREN'T SERIOUS ABOUT POLICY ABOUT WHAT THEY CLAIM TO STAND FOR, THEY WILL PICK DONALD TRUMP AS THEIR NOMINEE AND WARM THEMSELVES IN THE GLOW OF THE FIRE AS HE GOES DOWN IN FLAMES. THERE'S A GIFT FOR REPUBLICANS IN WHAT HAPPENED THIS WEEK. EVERY VICTORY CARRIES WITHIN IT THE SEEDS OF DEFEAT. EVERY DEFEAT, THE SEEDS OF VICTORY. IF REPUBLICANS HAD JUST WON, THEY NEVER WOULD HAVE LEARNED A THING. THEY CAN LEARN NOW. THE OLD SAYING IS THERE'S NO EDUCATION IN THE SECOND KICK OF A MULE. THIS IS THE THIRD KICK. AND AFTER 2018 AND 2020, MAYBE THEY WILL LEARN NOW. DAVID JOLLY, I'M JUST WONDERING. IN TERMS OF THE SUPPORT FOR DEMOCRACY THAT WE SAW, I THINK MANY MORE VOTERS THOUGHT THEY DIDN'T LIKE WHAT THEY SAW ON JANUARY 6th AND PERHAPS WAS ASSUMED. I ALSO THINK THAT FOR SOME VOTERS WHO WERE REALLY BUSY, WORRIED ABOUT INFLATION, WORRIED ABOUT GAS PRICES, BUSY WITHIN THEIR OWN LIVES WHO DIDN'T LIKE JANUARY 6th, WERE THEY NOT REMINDED WHEN PAUL PELOSI WAS ATTACKED JUST BEFORE THE MIDTERMS?  OH, ABSOLUTELY. I THINK WHAT WE SAW IN THIS MIDTERM IS YOUR TRADITIONALLY LOW TO MEDIUM PROPENSITY VOTERS. THOSE WHO ARE NOT HIGHLY ACTIVE DEMONSTRATED THEY'RE HIGHLY INFORMED, AND THEY CAN DISTILL MULTIPLE ISSUES FROM PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENTING DEMOCRACY TO INFLATION TO DOBBS. I THINK WHAT WE SAW IN 2022 IS A THREAD FROM THE COALITION IN '18 THAT CAME OUT TO SAY WE WANT TO STOP THE DIRECTION OF REPUBLICANS, TO '20 WHO SAID WE WANT TO STOP DONALD TRUMP, TO '22, REPUBLICANS ARE IN TROUBLE. PEGGY IS RIGHT. I WOULD SUGGEST THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DEMOCRATS TO SOLIDIFY THAT COALITION.

YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, HERE IN MASSACHUSETTS I WAS UP AGAINST A PERSON WHO WANTED TO BRING TRUMPISM TO MASSACHUSETTS. HE WAS AN ELECTION DENIER. HE WANTED TO TAKE AWAY ABORTION RIGHTS. THE VOTERS REJECTED THAT. I THINK FUNDAMENTALLY, PEOPLE MADE THE DECISION THAT THIS IS ABOUT OUR VALUES, THIS IS ABOUT OUR FREEDOMS, THIS IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE GOING TO STAND WITH AND STAND FOR. THAT IS WHY IT WAS SUCH A DECISIVE VICTORY, AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT. I'M PARTICULARLY GRATEFUL FOR ALL THE LITTLE GIRLS OUT THERE, ALL OF THE YOUNG LGBTQ PEOPLE WHO GOT BEHIND ME, SUPPORTED ME, ALONG WITH A HOST OF FOLKS ACROSS THE STATE. I WAS SUPPORTED BY DEMOCRATS, AND ALSO REPUBLICANS. PART OF THAT WAS BASED ON THE RECORD THAT WE DEVELOPED IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE WHERE WE SERVE THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. PART OF, IT LAWRENCE, WAS THE MESSAGE THAT I WAS BRINGING. IT WAS A MESSAGE OF LET'S BE POSITIVE, LET'S BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND LET'S BRING THE NOISE, VITRIOL, AND DIVISION. PEOPLE REALLY RESPONDED.  WHAT IS YOUR TOP PRIORITY ON DAY ONE, UNDER THE GOLDEN DOME OF THE MASSACHUSETTS STATE CAPITAL.  WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO. FUNDAMENTALLY, IT IS ABOUT LIFE HERE BETTER, FOR OUR RESIDENTS, GROWING OUR ECONOMY, MAKING LIFE MORE AFFORDABLE. WE REALLY NEED TO DEAL WITH HOUSING AND WORKFORCE ISSUES HERE IN THE STATE, BUT MASSACHUSETTS IS SUCH A GREAT STATE WITH SO MANY RESOURCES, SO MANY TALENTS. MY BACKGROUND, I USED TO PLAY BASKETBALL AND I PLAYED A LITTLE BIT FOR SPECIALLY BEFORE. THEN I GOT A REAL JOB MANDALA SCHOOL. I WAS A POINT GUARD, AND PART OF BEING A POINT GUARD IS TO SPIRIT TEAMWORK AND BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO WITH THIS ADMINISTRATION.  MASSACHUSETTS VOTERS GAVE YOU A NEW REVENUE SOURCE OF VOTING FOR A TAX ON INCOMES OVER 1 MILLION DOLLARS, HOW WILL THAT FIGURE INTO THE FISCAL PLANNING FOR THE STATE?  I THINK A COUPLE OF THINGS. ONE, IT IS GOING TO BE DIRECTED SPECIFICALLY AT INFRASTRUCTURE, TRANSPORTATION, AND EDUCATION. I ALSO SUPPORT TAX RELIEF. WE NEED TAX REFORMS HERE AS WELL, IN THE STATE. WE NEED TO BE A STATE THAT IS COMPETITIVE. I WANT MASSACHUSETTS TO BE A STATE WHERE PEOPLE WHO WERE BORN HERE, STAY HERE. PEOPLE WHO COME HERE, TO STUDY OR MOVE HERE, WANT TO GROW FAMILIES HERE AND GROW BUSINESSES. I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT OUR FUTURE, INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE TO BUILD AN INCREDIBLY STRONG CLIMATE CORRIDOR OF GREEN JOBS ACROSS THE STATE. THAT IS SOMETHING I AM VERY ANXIOUS TO DIG INTO.  MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR ELECT, MAURA HEALEY, REALLY GREAT TO HAVE YOU TONIGHT. PLEASE COME BACK WHEN YOU ARE GOVERNOR, AS OFTEN AS YOU CAN.  I LOOK FORWARD TO, BE WELL, THANK YOU.  THANK YOU. COMING UP, THE NAME ON THE BALLOT THAT I PERSONALLY CARE ABOUT MORE THAN ANY OTHER NAME ON ANY BALLOT IN AMERICA WAS A BIG WINNER ON TUESDAY NIGHT. THAT WINNER, WHOSE LIFE STORY IS BEYOND REMARKABLE WILL JOIN US NEXT. L JOIN US NEXT. 20221111033018.683|20221111033326.304",

        "trs": "WE SAW EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS IN THESE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, THAT NO ONE THOUGHT POSSIBLE. MORE INDEPENDENTS VOTED FOR DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANS IN THIS ELECTION. YOUNG PEOPLE, YOU VOTED IN HISTORIC NUMBERS AGAIN, JUST AS YOU DID NEW TWO YEARS AGO. YOUNG PEOPLE VOTED TO CONTINUE ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE CRISIS, GUN VIOLENCE, PERSONAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, STUDENT DEBT RELIEF, ALL OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU STEPPED UP TO DO. AS I SAID, WOMEN IN AMERICA MADE THEIR VOICES HEARD, MAN. I SAID LAST YEAR THAT ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY THINGS ABOUT THE DOBBS DECISION WAS WHAT WAS ABOUT TO CHALLENGE AMERICAN WOMEN WHEN THE JUSTICE SAID, LET'S SEE WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO. WELL GUESS WHAT? YOU ALL SHOWED UP AND BEAT THE HELL OF THEM.  VOTERS SHOWED UP IN KANSAS, TO A PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE STATE CONSTITUTION THAT WOULD'VE ALLOWED THE STATE TO BAN ABORTION. VOTERS SHOWED UP IN KANSAS TO ON TUESDAY TO REELECT THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF THAT VERY REPUBLICAN STATE, LAURA KELLY. AND DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN, CHERICE DAVIDS WAS REELECTED TUESDAY IN KANSAS. SHE WON BY OVER 12 POINTS IN A SUBURBAN DISTRICT OUTSIDE OF KANSAS CITY, BUT WAS JERRY MATTERED BY THE REPUBLICAN -CONTROLLED STATE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE IT EVEN HARDER FOR HER TO WIN. JOINING US NOW IS DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN CHERICE DAVIS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. YOU ARE WITH -- YOU HAVE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION THAT ALL OF US SITTING IN THE OTHER STATES ARE MARVELING AT. HOW'D DOES A DEMOCRAT WINNING KANSAS?  WELL, IT IS GOOD TO SEE. I THINK, THE WAY WE AROUND THIS CAMPAIGN, FIRST OF ALL I NEVER TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED. AND I THINK I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE, BUT I DO NOT STOP UNTIL THE BELL RINGS AND I THINK PEOPLE CAN TELL THAT I AM HERE, I HAVE WANTED THIS JOB, I'VE BEEN DOING THIS JOB TO ACTUALLY FOCUS ON THE WORK AND I THINK PEOPLE CAN SEE THAT AND THEY CARE ABOUT THAT. THE DISTRICT, ABSOLUTELY LOOKS DIFFERENT. WE'VE GOT MORE RURAL AREAS THAN WE HAVE HAD BEFORE, AND I HAD THE SAME APPROACH. I GO TO EVERY PART OF THE DISTRICT, I TALK TO EVERYBODY, I LISTEN TO LEARN SO THAT I CAN BE THE BEST REPRESENTATIVE FOR THIS DISTRICT THAT I POSSIBLY CAN BE. IT TURNS OUT THAT PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THAT.  SO HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU GOT THE INFORMATION OF EXACTLY HOW YOUR DISTRICT WOULD BE THE REDISTRICTED? I KNOW THERE ARE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WHO SIT THERE AND THEIR LIVES PASSED BEFORE THEIR EYES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T WIN. SOME OF THEM DECIDE NOT EVEN RUN, AND THEN OTHER STEROID IT AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HANDLE THIS NEW TERRITORY. WAS IT, DID IT LOOK LIKE SOMETHING THAT YOU COULD HANDLE AS SOON AS YOU SAW IT, OR DID YOU HAVE TO WORK YOUR WAY INTO REALIZING THAT YOU COULD DO IT?  THAT IS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION. I THINK BECAUSE IT WAS SO CLEARLY MORE A RURAL PARTS OF THE DISTRICT, I KNEW THAT I WAS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND MORE TIME ON THE ROAD. BUT ALSO REALLY HAVE TO LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT THE AGRICULTURAL PIECES, BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE FARMERS, GROWERS, PRODUCERS IN THIS DISTRICT THAN THERE WERE BEFORE AND I THINK IT REALLY PAYS OFF TO SHOW UP. TO LISTEN SO THAT YOU CAN LEARN AND PEOPLE KNOW WHEN YOU ARE SHOWING UP WITHOUT ASSUMPTIONS, WITHOUT PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT, WHAT ME AND I OFTEN SAY ASSUME I KNOW NOTHING. IT IS A CONGRESS JOKE BECAUSE CONGRESS PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW EVERYTHING ALREADY, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. I THINK THAT THAT MATTERED, AND THEN I GOT ONTO THE AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE AS SOON AS I COULD, BECAUSE THE FARM BILL IS COMING UP NEXT YEAR AND IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT A MASS PASSED BILL FOR THE STATE OF KANSAS, AND FOR THE KANSAS THIRD, IT IS THE FARM BILL.  WE DO NOT YET KNOW WHAT PARTY WILL BE IN CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, BUT FARM BILLS AND AGRICULTURE COMMITTEE WORK IS HISTORICALLY VERY BIPARTISAN. DO YOU EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE, NO MATTER WHICH PARTY IS IN CONTROL?  ABSOLUTELY. I AM GOING TO BE TRYING TO DO AS MUCH BIPARTISAN WORK THERE AS POSSIBLE. I HAVE A REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUE WHO IS IN THE KANSAS DELEGATION, TRACEY MANNY, REPRESENTS THE FIRST DISTRICT IS ON THE AGRICULTURAL COMMITTEE. I FULLY EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE WORKING TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FARMERS HERE IN KANSAS ARE BEING LISTENED TO AND HEARD WHEN WE ARE WORKING ON THAT BILL.  CONGRESSWOMAN CHERICE DAVIS, YOU MAKE IT LOOK EASY LIKE OF COURSE, SURE SHE WON IN KANSAS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US. I AM SURE THAT YOU HAVE A LOT TO TEACHER DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES WHEN YOU GET BACK TO WASHINGTON ABOUT WHAT IS LIKE TO WIN AS A DEMOCRATIC IN KANSAS.  HAVE A NICE NIGHT.  TONIGHT'S LAST WORD IS NEXT.

        "trs": "> I WILL ALWAYS, ALWAYS KEEP FIGHTING TO PROTECT A WOMAN'S FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOM AND TO BLOCK ANY ATTEMPTS -- BLOCK ANY ATTEMPTS TO BAN ABORTION NATIONWIDE.  WE'LL MAKE MICHIGAN A LEADER, A PLACE WHERE EVERY PERSON IS RESPECTED AND PROTECTED UNDER THE LAW. A PLACE WHERE WOMEN MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS.  TONIGHT, YOU, THE GOOD PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA, YOU WON. OPPORTUNITY WON. A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE WON!  DEMOCRATS TAKING A MUCH DESERVED VICTORY LAP THERE AFTER CAMPAIGNING HARD IN A DIFFICULT CLIMATE ON THEIR SUPPORT FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, TO MAKE HER OWN CHOICES ABOUT HER BODY. AFTER THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT STRIPPED AWAY THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO ABORTION ACCESS HELD IN THIS COUNTRY FOR 50 YEARS. DESPITE CLAIMS BY REPUBLICANS THAT ABORTION WAS A WEDGE ISSUE THAT DIVIDED AMERICANS, VOTERS FROM EVERY IDEOLOGICAL STRIFE SHOWED THEY ARE UNIFIED WANTING FREEDOM TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH AND THEIR BODIES WITHOUT POLITICIANS IN THE ROOM. AND EVERY BALLOT AMENDMENT CONTEST ON ABORTION, INCLUDING IN DEEP RED STATES LIKE MONTANA AND KENTUCKY, SUPPORTERS OF ABORTION RIGHTS AND FREEDOM WON. ANGER AROUND THE ISSUE OF ABORTION HELPED SECURE MAJOR DEMOCRATIC WINS ON A NIGHT THAT EVERY HISTORICAL INDICATOR SUGGESTS SHOULD HAVE BENEFITTED REPUBLICANS AND BIGLEY. \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" WRITES THIS, QUOTE, IN MICHIGAN WHERE NEARLY HALF OF VOTERS SAID ABORTION WAS THEIR TOP ISSUES, DEMOCRATS WON BOTH CHAMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND RE-ELECTED GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER, GIVING THE PARTY A TRIFECTA OF PARTY FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 40 YEARS. JOINING US, MALLY McMORROW PUTS IT, STATE HOUSE, STATE SENATE, GOVERNOR, HATE DID NOT WIN. JOINING US IS MALLORY McMORROW. SO, YOU WERE CONFIDENT WHEN WE LAST TALKED AHEAD OF THESE ELECTIONS. WHAT DID YOU FEEL THAT MAYBE YOU DIDN'T WANT TO SAY BEFORE BUT THAT WAS AFFIRMED IN THIS WEEK'S RESULTS?  YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS WANT TO BE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC SO YOU DON'T STOP WORKING, BUT ON THE GROUND FOR MONTHS NOW, THE ENERGY HASN'T DIED DOWN. THE MORE VOLUNTEERS I TALKED TO, EVEN IN SOME OF OUR TOUGHIST DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE, PEOPLE KEPT TELLING ME, THIS FEELS LIKE 2018 AGAIN. THIS FEELS LIKE 2018 AGAIN, AND THAT WAS HUGE. THAT MEANT WE WERE ON THE RIGHT TRACK, THAT MEANT PEOPLE WERE GOING TO STAY ENGAGED AND COME WITH US ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FINISH LINE.  YOU BROUGHT OUR ATTENTION BACK TO THE CAMPAIGN THAT GOVERNOR WHITMER RAN, AND SHE HAD A STUNNING, DECISIVE VICTORY THERE. WHAT, AS WE SORT OF START LOOKING AT THE LESSONS, WHAT CAN THE COUNTRY AND DEMOCRATS AND MAYBE EVEN SOME REPUBLICANS LEARN FROM THE CAMPAIGN SHE WAGED?  I THINK WE AS A TEAM IN MICHIGAN WORKED TOGETHER. THE GOVERNOR GOT RE-ELECTED WITH AN INCREDIBLY HEALTHY MARGIN. SHE PERFORMED BETTER THAN SHE DID IN 2018. AND WE FLIPPED THE STATE SENATE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY ENTIRE LIFETIME. MICHIGAN IS A BLUE TRIFECTA STATE HEADING INTO 2024, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S ONLY HAPPENED FOUR TIMES IN THE PAST 100 YEARS, BELIEVE IT OR NOT. AND I WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR LAST SEGMENT. THEY REALLY CAME DOWN TO CHARACTER AND QUALITY OF CANDIDATES. I THINK ABORTION AND DOBBS WAS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WOMEN WERE SET TO LOSE A RIGHT THAT WE'VE HAD FOR 50 YEARS. AND WHEN WE'RE COMING OUT OF THE PAST TWO YEARS OF JUST NONSTOP CHAOS, THAT FELT LIKE THE LAST STRAW TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. THE ATTITUDE I THINK SO MANY, PARTICULARLY WOMEN WERE CARRYING FORWARD IS, WHO IS THE PERSON I WANT IN THE TRENCHES WITH ME? WHO IS GOING TO LEAD US OUT OF CHAOS, NOT BACK INTO MORE CHAOS? PEOPLE WANT TO MOVE ON FROM 2020. PEOPLE WANT TO MAINTAIN OUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT GOVERNOR WHITMER DID EARLY, AND IT'S ALSO SOMETHING WE DID WITH EVERY SINGLE CANDIDATE ON THE BALLOT, TO REALLY DIVERGE FROM THE POLITICS OF HATE AND FEAR AND CHAOS. AND IT WORKED.  YOU ARE ONE OF THE BEST PEOPLE AT GOING RIGHT IN TO THE WEDGE CULTURE ATTACKS THAT THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO WAGE AGAINST THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. I LIKE TO SAY THAT SOME PEOPLE SAW AND LEARNED FROM THAT AND GOT THEMSELVES ON OFFENSE ON THESE ISSUES. THE TRUTH IS, THE FIRST EXIT POLL DATA WE SAW WAS THAT 60% OF VOTERS OPPOSE DOBBS AND 60% OF VOTERS OPPOSE THE SUPREME COURT. IS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY READY TO MAKE THE SUPREME COURT AN ISSUE THAT GETS THE WHOLE PARTY AND THIS BROAD COALITION ON OFFENSE FOR 30 YEARS THE WAY THE REPUBLICANS DID FOR THE LAST 30?  I THINK WE HAVE TO, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ATTACKS ON OUR RIGHTS. THE SUPREME COURT HAS ALREADY NODDED TO TAKING AWAY MARRIAGE EQUALITY, CONTRACEPTION. PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO GO BACKWARDS. WHAT WE HAVE TO DO AS A PARTY ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY IS REALLY BRING THE ISSUE HOME FOR EVERYBODY. I THINK TALKING ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT STILL FEELS LIKE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED VERY FAR AWAY IN AN IVORY TOWER SOMEWHERE, BUT LOSING YOUR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IS SOMETHING PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO FIGHT FOR AND JOIN YOUR TEAM TO BE A PART OF. AND IF WE'VE LEARNED ANYTHING, AND I THINK WE HAVE, WE HAVE TO STAND UP FOR PEOPLE, WE HAVE TO FIGHT AND BRING THEM ALONG WITH US TO SHOW US THE WAY FORWARD OUT OF THIS INCREDIBLY CHAOTIC MOMENT.  YOU AND I TALKED RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTIONS. I HAD HEARD FROM A SOURCE IN MICHIGAN AND A CANDIDATE IN PENNSYLVANIA THAT SOMETHING TURNED IN THAT LAST WEEK. THAT THE LAST WEEK FELT MUCH BETTER THAN THE TWO WEEKS BEFORE THAT. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT WAS? HAVE YOU KIND OF GONE BACK AND FIGURED THAT OUT?  IT DID. IT REALLY DID FEEL HOPEFUL, AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT FOR THOSE IN PLACES LIKE MICHIGAN AND I'M SURE MY COUNTERPARTS, TOO, LIKE WE HAVEN'T KNOWN THIS FEELING IN A LONG TIME. I THINK IT'S THE PUSH OF THE GET OUT THE VOTE TIME PERIOD WHERE AT THAT POINT, YOU'RE NOT REALLY THINKING ABOUT STRATEGY ANYMORE. YOU'RE JUST GOING AND YOU'RE GETTING OUT THERE AND YOU'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE AND YOU'RE HOLDING RALLIES AND THE MOOD WAS CELEBRATORY. IT FELT LIKE MUCH LIKE THE WOMEN'S MARCH DID RIGHT AFTER DONALD TRUMP GOT ELECTED WHERE, YOU KNOW, I EXPECTED THE WORST, BUT PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED WOMEN'S MARCHES ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY LEFT THOSE EVENTS FEELING HOPEFUL. LIKE WE FOUND OUR PEOPLE AND WE FOUND OUR PEOPLE. AND THAT'S WHAT IT FELT LIKE THE LAST WEEK ON THE GROUND IN MICHIGAN.  YOURSELF, PRESIDENT BIDEN, GOVERNOR WHITMER MADE CLEAR PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LIVING IN A DEMOCRACY AND CARING ABOUT INFLATION. GOVERNOR WHITMER TIED ECONOMIC FREEDOMS TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. THE WHOLE IDEA THAT DEMOCRACY WAS THIS LUXURY ISSUE WHEN YOU HAVE HIGH INFLATION WAS SOMETHING THAT, I THINK, SOME OF THE BEST CANDIDATES THIS CYCLE ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE MADE CLEAR WAS A FALSE CHOICE. IT WAS A CONSTRUCT FROM THE RIGHT. IT WAS SORT OF KNOCKED DOWN. WHAT IS THE LESSON, THEN, AS WE SORT OF CONTINUE TO, I THINK, HAVE AN ELECTORATE THAT'S UNEASY AND ANXIOUS ABOUT THE COST OF THINGS?  I THINK WHAT GOVERNOR WHITMER DID REALLY WELL IS SHE PLANTED A FLAG EARLY ON REPRODUCTIVE AND ABORTION RIGHTS. WELL BEFORE THE DOBBS ISSUE, WELL BEFORE ANYTHING HAPPENED. IN MICHIGAN WE WERE PROACTIVE INSTEAD OF REACTIVE. THAT FREED HER UP TO TAUB ABOUT THE ECONOMY, TO TALK ABOUT INFLATION. AND WHAT SHE DID AND DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE IN PLACES WHERE WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THESE ARE ISSUES. DON'T RUN AWAY FROM THEM. AT THE SAME TIME REPUBLICANS WERE ACKNOWLEDGING INFLATION AND THEN BLAMING TRANS KIDS WHO WANT TO PLAY SPORTS, DEMOCRATS WERE SAYING, HEY, IT'S A TOUGH TIME RIGHT NOW, BUT GOVERNOR WHITMER TALKED ABOUT RECORD INVESTMENT ON EDUCATION, GETTING KIDS BACK ON TRACK AFTER GOING THROUGH A PANDEMIC AND LEARNING LOSS, EXPANDING CHILD CARE AND IT RESONATED WITH VOTERS AGAIN. IT'S WHO DO YOU WANT IN THE TRENCHES WITH YOU. IT'S A HARD TIME RIGHT NOW. YEAH, WE'VE GOT PROGRESS BUT WE HAVE TO KEEP MAKING PROGRESS, NOT PRETENDING LIKE THE ISSUES DON'T EXIST. NOT BLAMING SOMEBODY ELSE AND NOT REFUSING TO OFFER ANY SOLUTIONS. THAT'S ALL THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAD.  INDEED. MICHIGAN STATE SENATOR, ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO TALK TO YOU, MALLORY McMORROW, THANK YOU.  THANK YOU. > WITH THE MIDTERMS KIND OF MOVING BEHIND US, NOT QUITE COMPLETELY, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING, QUESTIONS NOW ARISE ABOUT WHETHER THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS READY TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON ITS PLEDGE THAT NO ONE PERSON, NO ONE IN THIS COUNTRY IS ABOVE THE LAW.

AND WE HAVE TO REALLY SHOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO AUTHENTICALLY FIGHT ON BOTH OF THOSE.  NEW HAMPSHIRE IN A REALLY RESOUNDING WAY STOOD UP FOR COMMON SENSE, FOR REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM AND FOR DEMOCRACY.  WE ALL CONSISTLY AT EVERY LEVEL, STATE LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATES, STATE SENATE CANDIDATES, MADE CLEAR DEMOCRACY WAS ON THE BALLOT AND FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, INCLUDING REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM WAS ON THE BALLOT.  HI, EVERYONE. IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK. SIMPLY PUT, THE WINNERS OF TUESDAY NIGHT'S ELECTIONS BOIL DOWN TO THOSE WHO RESPOND TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS' CONCERNS AND NEEDS AND WORRIES BEST. AS YOU JUST HEARD FROM A FEW OF THE DEMOCRATS WHO PREVAILED ON TUESDAY, VOTERS WERE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THEY WANTED. THEY WANTED REPRESENTATIVES WHO WILL PROTECT DEMOCRACY, PROTECT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, AND PROTECT AND SAFEGUARD AND STRENGTHEN OUR ECONOMY. FOR THE MOST PART, VOTERS DIDN'T WANT MORE OF THE LIES AND EXTREMISM BEING SPREAD BY THE DISGRACED EX-PRESIDENT AND ALL OF HIS HAND-PICKED CANDIDATES. THERE WAS NO SHELLACKING. THERE WAS NO THUMPING OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT'S RECORD. AN HISTORIC MARKER DEMONSTRATING THAT EVEN THOUGH PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN'S APPROVAL NUMBERS MIGHT NOT BE HIGH BY HISTORICAL STANDARDS, HE AND HIS PARTY WERE VIEWED AS THE PREFERABLE ALTERNATIVE THAN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WHO FOR YEARS HAS ASSAULTED THE PHONE ADDITION OF OUR COUNTRY AND JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO GLEEFULLY CELEBRATED WHEN THE SUPREME COURT TOOK AWAY A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AN ABORTION. SOMETHING WOMEN IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE HAD FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS. AT THIS MOMENT, KEY RACES IN THE U.S. SENATE AND THE U.S. HOUSE HAVE STILL NOT BEEN CALLED. IT IS NOT CLEAR WHO WILL CONTROL THE CHAMBERS. OUTSTANDING RACES WILL DETERMINE WHICH PARTY DOES. BUT WE KNOW FOR SURE IS FORECASTED RED WAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT OTHER PLACES, NOT HERE, AND ALL THE ELECTION DENIALISM THAT WENT WITH IT DID NOT COME AND WILL NOT COME. TOM FRIEDMAN WRITES THIS, TUESDAY'S ELECTIONS REALLY WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT TEST SINCE THE CIVIL WAR OF WHETHER THE ENGINE OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, OUR ABILITY TO PEACEFULLY AND LEGITIMATELY TRANSFER POWER, REMAINS INTACT. AND IT LOOKS TO HAVE COME THROUGH. A LITTLE DINGED UP BUT OKAY. A VERY FIRED UP PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN SPOKE THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT THE STRENGTH OF OUR DEMOCRACY.  YOU BELIEVED IN THE SYSTEM. YOU BELIEVED IN THE INSTITUTIONS. YOU FOUGHT LIKE HELL FOR IT. THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT HAPPENED IN MY VIEW IN THIS ELECTION. IT WAS THE FIRST NATIONAL ELECTIONS SINCE JANUARY 6th, AND THERE WERE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER DEMOCRACY WOULD MEET THE TEST. IT DID! IT DID! IT DID!  IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE DEMOCRACY HAS BEEN THAT BIG OF AN APPLAUSE LINE. I THINK THAT'S GOOD FOR ALL OF US. WE START WITH WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF RON KLAIN. HOW ARE YOU FEELING? TAKE ME INSIDE. EVEN A GOOD DAY, A STRESSFUL PLACE TO WORK, THE WEST WING.  YEAH, THANKS FOR HAVING ME. LOOK, OBVIOUSLY, YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS, ELECTION DAYS ARE VERY, VERY STRESSFUL DAYS. I WILL SAY WE WENT INTO IT FEELING MUCH BETTER THAN THE PUNDITRY HAD PREDICTED. THE PRESIDENT DELIVERED ON COVID, ON INFRASTRUCTURE, ON JOBS, ON PROTECTING REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMS, ON SPEAKING OUT FOR DEMOCRACY. WE BELIEVED IN WHAT THE PRESIDENT SAID AND DELIVERED. OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE GRATIFIED BY THE RESULTS THE ELECTION PRODUCED. AS YOU SAY, VOTES ARE STILL BEING COUNTED IN ARIZONA, NEVADA. WE'LL HAVE A RUNOFF IN GEORGIA. A LOT OF PLACES IN CALIFORNIA AREN'T RESOLVED. WE KNOW ALREADY THAT THE PRESIDENT PRODUCED THE STRONGEST RESULT FOR HIS PARTY IN A FIRST MIDTERM OF ANY PRESIDENT -- A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT IN 60 YEARS. WE KNOW HE'S PRODUCED MAYBE THE FIRST PRESIDENT SINCE FDR TO GET EVERY ONE OF HIS INCUMBENTS RE-ELECTED. WE HAD A VERY, VERY GOOD ELECTION AND THE PRESIDENT STANDING UP FOR WHAT HE BELIEVES IN, PROGRESS ON THE ECONOMY, ABORTION RIGHTS AND DEMOCRACY AND THE VOTERS RESPONDED.  WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOW THE BIDEN ECONOMY IS LIKE THE RODNEY DANGERFIELD ECONOMY. IT DOESN'T GET THE RESPECT IT DESERVES BECAUSE THE INFLATION STORY OBSCURES IT. I THINK YOU COULD EXTEND THAT TORTURED DESCRIPTION TO THE ADMINISTRATION. IN A LOT OF INSTANCE, AND I THINK TUESDAY BEARS THIS OUT, THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA DOESN'T GET THE RESPECT IT DESERVES. THE TRUTH IS A LOT OF THE DEMOCRATS WHO PULLED OUT WINS IN THE HOUSE RAN ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. THEY RAN ON THE PRESIDENT'S AGENDA. DOES HE FEEL -- I WON'T FILL IN THE BLANK, BUT HOW DOES HE FEEL ABOUT THAT?  LOOK, I THINK HE FEELS VERY GRATIFIED ABOUT IT. I AGREE. WHAT WE'VE DONE SINCE WE'VE BEEN HERE IS WE'VE GOVERNED. WE PASSED BILLS WITH ONLY DEMOCRATS. WE PASSED BILLS ON A BIPARTISAN BILL WHENEVER POSSIBLE, THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL, THE C.H.I.P.S. BILL, THE VETERANS BILL. WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING IS WHEN THE PRESIDENT MADE THOSE CONGRATULATORY CALLS ON TUESDAY NIGHT, ONE BY ONE, MEMBERS WHO WERE RE-ELECTED JUST VOLUNTEERED UP TO THE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, MR. PRESIDENT, I RAN ON YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE BILL. IT GAVE ME SOMETHING TO SELL TO THE VOTERS. I RAN ON THE C.H.I.P.S. BILL. TALKED ABOUT OUR HIGH-TECH MANUFACTURING FUTURE. MR. PRESIDENT, I RAN ON ALL THE PROGRESS WE MADE ON COVID. IT'S INTERESTING, WE OVERPERFORMED IN THOSE FRONT-LINE INCUMBENT DISTRICTS. THE PEOPLE WHERE YOU THINK A PARTY IN POWER WOULD LOSE, THOSE INCUMBENTS WON. REPUBLICAN PICKUPS CAME IN OPEN SEATS, WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE AN INCUMBENT TO RUN ON THE PRESIDENT'S RECORD. BUT THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE USUALLY VULNERABLE IN MIDTERM KNEW INCUMBENTS, FRONT-LINE INCUMBENTS, THEY DID EXCEPTIONALLY WELL BECAUSE THEY HAD SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. I THINK ONE OTHER THING THE PUNDITRY MISSED, I THINK THE BIGGEST THING THEY MISSED, I THINK THEY UNDERESTIMATED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE POLLS SHOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE FRUSTRATED WITH INFLATION. WE'RE FRUSTRATED WITH INFLATION. WHAT THEY LOOKED AT WAS A PRESIDENT WHO IS WORKING HARD TO DELIVER AND A REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT HAD NO ANSWERS, ONLY CRITICISMS. AND I THINK THAT WAS THE CHOICE BEFORE THE VOTERS. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE REASON WHY SO MANY DEMOCRATS WON.  YOU AND I HAVE A LOT OF THINGS IN COMMON, HAVING SPENT OUR CAREERS IN POLITICS OVER THE SAME SORT OF CHAPTERS IN AMERICA AND POLITICAL HISTORY. BUT I WORK FOR A PRESIDENT OF TWO WHOSE MIDTERM STORY DEFIED THE HISTORICAL TREND. AND I ALWAYS FELT LIKE THIS YEAR HAD THIS GUT THING IN COMMON WITH '02 AND THE CAPITOL WAS ATTACKED. WHETHER THE INSURRECTION WAS A VOTING ISSUE OR NOT, YOU HAD THIS GUT THING THAT, WELL, ONE PARTY WANTS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND MAKE SURE IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN AND THE OTHER PARTY WANTS TO CALL IT A TOURIST VISIT. HOW IN THE END, IN THE PRESIDENT'S REALLY BEEN OUT THERE ON DEMOCRACY, HOW IN THE END WAS THAT -- YOU KNOW, WAS THAT SORT OF -- WAS THAT THE FLOOR AND THEN THE POLICY DEBATES ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND CHOICE HAPPEN. I MEAN, HOW IMPORTANT WAS IT IN YOUR VIEW, AND IN HINDSIGHT FOR THE PRESIDENT TO REALLY COME BACK TO THE THEMES OF HIS INAUGURAL ADDRESS ABOUT DEMOCRACY?  LOOK, I THINK IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PRESIDENT PERSONALLY, IMPORTANT TO EVERYTHING HE BELIEVED IN. AS YOU KNOW, HE LAUNCHED HIS CAMPAIGN ON THE IDEA THAT HIS CANDIDACY WAS A BATTLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA. AND AT THE TIME, PEOPLE KIND OF SAID, THAT'S CRAZY. YOU SHOULD TALK ABOUT THE ECONOMY MORE. HE SAID, THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE IN. THIS IS WHAT I THINK IS THE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERLYING, UNDERPINNING OF IT. HE GOT ELECTED ON THAT. WE SAW JANUARY 6th. HE SPOKE OUT ABOUT THAT. THE LAST WEEK OF THE CAMPAIGN, ONE OF HIS BIG CLOSING SPEECHES WAS ABOUT DEMOCRACY. PEOPLE SAID, THAT'S NOT SMART POLITICALLY. AND THE PRESIDENT -- I THINK HIS COMPASS ON THIS HAS BEEN RIGHT. DEMOCRACY THE FUNDAMENTAL THING THAT EVERYTHING ELSE IS BASED ON. WE CAN DEBATE ECONOMIC POLICY. PEOPLE CAN AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH JOE BIDEN ON THE ECONOMY. THEY CAN AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH OUR CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY. BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE A DEMOCRACY, ALL THOSE DISAGREEMENTS ARE IRRELEVANT. SO, THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS BED ROCK FOR JOE BIDEN. HE WANTED TO PUT IT BEFORE THE VOTERS. HE WANTED TO PUT IT DIRECTLY TO THEM. I THINK THE RESULTS YOU'RE SEEING, NOT JUST OF THE CONGRESSIONAL RACES BUT ALL THESE SECRETARY OF STATE RACES FOR ELECTION DENIERS ARE LOSING, DOWN-BALLOT RACES WHERE THE DOWN-BALLOT CANDIDATES ARE OUTPERFORMING THE UP-BALLOT CANDIDATES SHOW YOU THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT. VOTERS WANT TO PROTECT OUR DEMOCRACY.  DOES THE PRESIDENT LOOK FORWARD TO NOT AN I TOLD YOU SO. I KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT'S NOT WHO HE IS. BUT DOES HE LOO, FORWARD TO OR IS HE OPTIMISTIC THERE WILL BE ANY RESET, THAT McCONNELL MAY ACT LIKE McCONNELL AGAIN AND NOT TED CRUZ? WHAT ARE HIS EXPECTATIONS OF THE REPUBLICANS NOW?  WELL, LOOK, AS HE SAID THE OTHER DAY, HE HAS SINCE HE GOT HERE TRIED TO GOVERN IN A BIPARTISAN WAY. AND HE'S PREPARED TO DO THAT. NO MATTER WHAT THE FINAL COUNTS SHOW ABOUT THE NUMBER OF DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE. AND I THINK THE QUESTION IS REALLY GOING TO GO TO THE REPUBLICANS. ARE THEY PREPARED TO BE GORNING PARTNERS? ARE THEY PREPARED TO WORK ON THE FUNDAMENTALS, FUNDING OUR GOVERNMENT, KEEPING OUR ECONOMY MOVING AHEAD, YOU KNOW, HELPING TO FIGHT COVID. ALL THESE THINGS ARE A BASIC FUNDAMENTALS THAT SHOULD CROSS PARTY LINES THAT WE SHOULD DELIVER ON. THINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH. THE PRESIDENT MENTIONED THIS YESTERDAY. IT ISN'T A POLITICAL ISSUE. FIGHTING CANCER. THESE THINGS WHERE WE HAVE STRONG INITIATIVES. I HOPE THE REPUBLICANS WILL JOIN US AND HELP US MAKE PROGRESS ON THOSE THINGS. THIS SHOULD BE A TIME WHERE WE FIND COMMON GROUND. THE PRESIDENT ALSO MADE QUITE CLEAR, I DON'T WANT TO BE NAIVE ABOUT THIS, HE'S DRAWING THE LINE. HE'S NOT GOING TO LET REPUBLICANS CUT SOCIAL SECURITY OR MEDICARE. CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO LET THEM PASS AN ABORTION BAN. ON AREAS WHERE WE CAN FIND COMMON GROUND, THAT'S WHAT WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S LOOKED FOR SINCE DAY ONE AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE. WE'LL TRY TO DO EVEN MORE OF IT IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS.  WHAT'S NEXT FOR YOU, TWO MORE YEARS?  WELL, IT'S AN HONOR TO COME WORK HERE EVERY DAY. I WORK WITH THE MOST AMAZING GROUP OF PEOPLE I'VE EVER WORKED WITH NOO MY LIFE. IT'S HARD WORK BUT I'M EXCITED FOR IT. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO COMING BACK TO WORK EVERY DAY.  FOR TWO MORE YEARS?  WELL, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.  CONGRATULATIONS. I SAY THIS EVERY TIME YOU'RE HERE. EVERY SINGLE THING THAT COMES TO AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT, WHICH IS EVERYTHING, COMES ACROSS ONE PERSON'S DESK AND IT'S YOURS. THANK YOU FOR HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH US LEADING UP TO THE ELECTIONS PRETTY REGULARLY. WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL.  INDEED. IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE. THANK YOU.  WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF, RON KLAIN. > JOINING OUR COVERAGE, MIKE DOWD AND DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER AND PRESIDENT OF BRILLIANT CORNERS RESEARCH JOINING ME AT THE TABLE, \"NEW YORK TIMES\" EDITORIAL, AND MARK STENGEL IS BACK. LUCKY FOR US, THEY'RE ALL MSNBC CONTRIBUTORS. I'M PROUD TO HAVE THE TWO POLLSTERS WHO CALLED THIS RACE EXACTLY AS IT TURNED OUT. MATT DOWD, YOU WANT TO GO FIRST?  WELL, I'M SUPPOSED TO DANCE IN THE END ZONE OR SOMETHING THAT WE GOT --  I DON'T KNOW. WE CAN GO BACK TO LOOKING AT RACES AND TALKING ABOUT PROBLEMS TOMORROW, BUT I THINK YOU CAN DANCE TODAY.  THANK YOU. TO ME, I MEAN, I'M NOT A GENIUS. IT DOESN'T TAKE ROCKET SCIENCE, AS CORNEL KNOWS AND AS YOU KNOW, IS YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE INFORMATION IN FRONT OF YOU IN AN OBJECTIVE WAY. NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO HAPPEN, BUT WHAT IS HAPPENING. AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS. AND EVERY PIECE OF INFORMATION LOOKED AT OBJECTIVELY SHOWED ME NO RED WAVE, NO BLUE WAVE. WE WOULD HAVE A SERIES OF MIXED RESULTS. DEMOCRATS WOULD OUTPERFORM WHAT THEY NORMALLY PERFORM. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. I LOOKED AT INDEPENDENT VOTERS THROUGHOUT THIS. THEY WEREN'T BREAKING TO REPUBLICANS. A SURE SIGN THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT TYPE ELECTION. THE THING YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT, AND I KNOW CORNEL MENTIONED IT, WAS THIS IDEA OF PEOPLE THAT SOMEWHAT DISAPPROVED OF BIDEN WERE SPLITTING THEIR VOTES AND NOT GOING OVERWHELMING TO REPUBLICANS LIKE THEY DID AGAINST OBAMA AND LIKE THEY DID AGAINST TRUMP AND LIKE THEY DID AGAINST REAGAN AND LIKE THEY'VE DONE AGAINST EVERY PRESIDENT. AND ON ELECTION DAY, THE DEMOCRATS WON THE PEOPLE THAT SOMEWHAT DISAPPROVED OF THE PRESIDENT. SO, THE DATA WAS THERE. THE OTHER THING BIGGER PICTURE I'LL SAY ABOUT THE FORECASTERS AND MODELERS AND TOO MANY OF US GET CAUGHT IN THIS, IS HISTORY IS IMPORTANT. HISTORY IS IMPORTANT, TO UNDERSTAND HISTORY. BUT HISTORY IS NOT DETERMINATIVE. AND HISTORY IN A DISRUPTIVE MOMENT LIKE WE'VE HAD IN THE LAST FOUR OR FIVE YEARS IS NOT A LOT OF USE UNLESS YOU LOOK AT IT ON THE GROUND. IT REMINDS ME, THE FORECASTERS AND MODELERS WHO KEPT REPEATING HISTORY, HISTORY, HISTORY, THIS IS HISTORY, REMIND ME OF SOMEBODY OBSERVING A BATTLE BETWEEN PEOPLE THAT WERE THROWING ROCKS PEOPLE THAT HAD DISCOVERED STEEL. AND THEN THE FORECAST RZ WERE LIKE, THE PEOPLE WITH BIGGER ROCKS ALWAYS WIN. WHAT HAPPENED, THE PEOPLE WITH BIGGER ROCKS ALWAYS WIN. WHAT HAPPENED WAS A DISRUPTIVE MOMENT WHEN STEEL WAS INVENTED. THAT'S THE MOMENT WE'RE IN THAT I THINK ALL OF THE PAST HISTORICAL MODELS ON THESE ELECTIONS BECAUSE OF THE MOMENT WE'RE IN AND BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AS YOU MENTIONED, JANUARY 6th, THE THREATS TO OUR DEMOCRACY, ALL THOSE THINGS, WHICH WE'VE NEVER POLLED ON EVER BEFORE, BEFORE THIS YEAR, SINCE THE JANUARY 6th HAPPENINGS, INSURRECTION, THIS IS A DISRUPTIVE MOMENT AND HISTORICAL MODELS DO NOT APPLY.  DISRUPTIVE SEEMS LIKE A NICE WAY TO PUT IT. OUR POLITICS HAVE BECOME A YOU KNOW WHAT SHOW. I THINK THE IDEA THAT ANYTHING NORMAL STILL EXISTS WAS WRONG THE WHOLE TIME. THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S NORMAL ANYMORE. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE READ IT. I DIDN'T WATCH IT BUT READ IT. THE TWICE IMPEACHED EX-PRESIDENT GAVE A PEOPLE MONDAY BEFORE THE ELECTION WHEN HE CALLED FOR DRUG DEALERS TO BE SHOT AND THE BULLETS TO BE TAKEN OUT OF THEIR BODIES AND SENT TO THEIR VICTIMS. HE ALSO CALLED FOR SXROERTS JOURNALISTS TO BE JAILED AND HOPED THEY WERE RAPED IN PRISON. THERE WAS SOME DARK, SICK STUFF FROM THE LEADER OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE CULTURE, THE MONDAY BEFORE PEOPLE VOTED. THERE'S ALSO THIS HISTORY -- AND IT'S NOT 9/11, BUT IT WAS AN HISTORIC ATTACK ON THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT, THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6th. ONE PARTY PLUS LIZ CHENEY AND ADAM KINZINGER WANTED TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF MAKING SURE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. THE OTHER DID NOT SHOW UP TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHAT THEY DID OR DID NOT KNOW ABOUT IT. THIS MAY NOT BE SOMETHING EVERYONE TURNED OUT AND VOTED FOR BUT IT IS, AS MATT DOWD IS SAYING, IT IS THE THING WE'RE LIVING THROUGH.  YEAH. WELL, ONE, LIKE MATT, I WILL DO A VICTORY DANCE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW --  THAT'S WHY WE LOVE YOU.  THE THREE OF US HAVE BEEN SHOUTING THIS FOR A WHILE.  I'LL BE YOUR DANCE PARTNER. I'LL BE HIS DANCE PARTNER.  I WILL DO A VICTORY LAP BECAUSE SOME OF US DID GET IT RIGHT. THE PUNDITRY CLASS TAKES A BEATING ALL THE TIME. THE PRESIDENT TALKED ABOUT IT. NOT ALL OF PUNDITS WERE WRONG. SOME OF US HAD IT RIGHT. THERE WAS NO RED WAVE BECAUSE WE HAD DYNAMIC CHANGING EVENTS HERE. BUT THERE IS SOMETHING BIGGER AT STAKE THAN JUST YOUR -- THAN THE PRICE OF GAS. DEMOCRACY WAS AT STAKE, FREEDOM WAS AT STAKE AND THESE WERE DYNAMIC-SHIFTING EVENTS. I HARKEN BACK TO SOME OF THE CRITICISM SOME OF US HAVE TAKEN ABOUT, YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS ARE TALKING TOO MUCH ABOUT ABORTION AND A WOMAN'S RIGHT, YOU'RE TALKING TOO MUCH ABOUT DEMOCRACY. WHEN YOU LOOK INSIDE EXIT POLLS -- ONE THING ABOUT EXIT POLLS, THERE WASN'T FOCUS ON DEMOCRACY, SO A BIG MISS BY SOME OF THE POLLSTERS. WHEN YOU LOOK INSIDE THE EXIT POLL AND LOOK AT HOW ABORTION ISSUE, THE ABORTION RIGHTS ISSUE WAS NECK AND NECK WITH WITH INFLATION AS A CHOICE FOR WHY THEY WERE VOTING THE WAY THEY WERE VOTING. GUESS WHAT. IF WE HADN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHO HE HADN'T BEEN TALKING ABOUT DEMOCRACY AT STAKE, AND IF THIS HAD, IN FACT, JUST BEEN A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND INFLATION, DEMOCRATS WOULD HAVE GOTTEN MURDERED IN THIS MIDTERM ELECTIONS ELECTION. SO, WE DID HAVE DYNAMIC SHIFTING, BIG EVENTS HAPPENING THAT WERE, FRANKLY, MORE IMPORTANT AND MORE FUNDAMENTAL TO AMERICANS THAN THE CURRENT PRICE OF GAS. I HAVE TO SAY, LOOK, I AM HEARTENED BY THE RESULTS. I AM -- I AM ENCOURAGED BY THE NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE ENERGIZED AND CAME OUT. LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT SOMETHING. I SAID THIS THE DAY OF THE ELECTION. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SAVE US FROM AUTHORITARIANISM. THEY'RE GOING TO -- AND WE'VE GOT TWO REALLY -- TWO ELECTORATES, ONE YOUNGER, VERY DIVERSE, ONE TRYING TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY IN TWO VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GETTING IN THE GAME AND LET'S HOPE THEY STAY IN THE GAME.  I WANT TO ADD ONE THING. THIS IS A GREAT -- I THINK THIS IS A GREAT MOMENT AS THE PRESIDENT SAID ABOUT THE PESER VAGS OF DEMOCRACY. WHAT IT ALSO DOES IS MANY PUNDITS AND FORECASTERS GAVE UP ON THAT THE QUALITY OF A CANDIDATE MATTERS. THE QUALITY OF AN EE LENGTHED -- ELECTED OFFICIAL MATTERS. THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD UNLOAD THE CLOWN CAR OF ALL OF THESE RACES. IN RACE AFTER RACE AFTER RACE, THERE WAS A QUALITY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE WHO WAS STANDING UP FOR DEMOCRACY, SPEAKING TO THE VOTERS ABOUT THEIR FREEDOMS IN THE MOMENT AND DOING THE JOB, THE INCUMBENTS, DOING THE JOB THEY WERE ELECT THE TO DO VERSUS A CLOWN SHOW. BEST CASE SCENARIO, CLOWN SHOW. AT WORST CASE, PEOPLE WERE A FUNDAMENTAL THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. I WAS HEARTENED TO SEE THE QUALITY OF THE CANDIDATES, THE VALUE OF THE QUALITY OF A CANDIDATE OR OFFICE HOLDER, VOTERS UNDERSTAND.  I THINK THE OTHER THING, AND I THINK DEMOCRATS CLOSED ON THIS VERY WELL. SOME OF THEM TALKED ABOUT IT THE WHOLE TIME. IT WAS A TRAP FROM THE RIGHT THAT YOU COULDN'T LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY AND CARE ABOUT THE PRICE OF MILK. THAT WAS NEVER RIGHT. THAT WAS NEVER THE WAY VOTERS PROCESSED IT. PEOPLE ARE UPSET ABOUT THE PRICE OF THINGS. SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIFFICULT CHOICES THEY MAKE EVERY DAY AND EVERY WEEK BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU GIVE UP DEMOCRACY TO HAVE THAT.  NOT ONLY WAS THAT A FALSE CHOICE, I THINK WHAT THE POLLS MAY HAVE MISSED IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH AMERICANS OVERALL, AND CERTAINLY MORE DEMOCRATS THAN REPUBLICANS, BUT SEEMINGLY INDEPENDENTS AS WELL, KIND OF WERE ABLE TO BLAME OR CONNECT THE DECLINED EVERY WANTED EVERY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WITH THE DECLINE OF THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE PRICE OF GAS, THE PRICE OF FOOD, CRIME, AND YOU REALLY -- -- YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT HAS CHANGED, THIS PANDEMIC, AND THIS FORMER PRESIDENT THAT HAS BROKEN APART AMERICAN LIFE. REALLY THE THING THAT CONNECTS THAT IS THE FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP UNDER THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND I THINK WE MAY HAVE MISSED THAT A LITTLE BIT. I THINK THERE WERE A LOT OF AMERICANS WHO EITHER EITHER DEMOCRATS AND SAID, I'M SHOWING UP BECAUSE THE FATE OF DEMOCRACY IS NOT SOME THEORETICAL NOTION. IT SHOZ TO DO WITH THE FREEDOM OF MYSELF AND MY FAMILY AND THE STABILITY OF MY COMMUNITY. AND ALSO INDEPENDENTS AND MAYBE SOME REPUBLICANS WHO SAID, YOU KNOW, I MAY NOT AGREE ON EVERYTHING, BUT THIS IS JUST GOTTEN TOO CRAZY, TOO OUT OF CONTROL. PEOPLE DON'T WANT UNCERTAINTY.  AND PEOPLE DON'T WANT EXTREMISM. JOSH SHAPIRO RAN A COUNTER-EXTREMISM CASE IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA AND REPUBLICANS PROVIDED EXAMPLE AFTER EXAMPLE, AND SO DID THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT. THEY DIDN'T JUST OVERTURN A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. THEY SAID, WE'RE COMING FOR MARRIAGE EQUALITY NEXT.  YEAH, PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT THE INSANITY. I MEAN, THE THING MATT POINT OUT I THOUGHT WAS THE MOST INTERESTING THING IN THE POLLING AND THE TABS I LOOKED AT, WHICH IS THAT BIDEN WAS MUCH LESS OF A DRAG ON THE DEMOCRATIC TICKET THAN TRUMP WAS ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKET. FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIGH AND FAVORABLES OF TRUMP, THEY VOTED AGAINST REPUBLICANS TWO-THIRDS OF THE TIME. FOR PEOPLE WHO HAD HIGH UNFAVORABLES AGAINST BIDEN, THEY ONLY VOTED AGAINST DEMOCRATS HALF OF THE TIME. TO ME THAT WASN'T SO MUCH DEMOCRACY, IT WAS SANITY. WE DON'T LIKE THE CHAOS. THEY DON'T WANT CHAOS, ELECTION DENIERS. IT FELT TO ME LIKE THE FEVER HAD BROKEN, THE MOMENTUM HAD BROKEN. I'LL HAPPILY DANCE WITH OUR TWO FRIENDS, OUR POLLSTERS, MATT AND CORNELL, BUT I HOPE THAT IS THE BEGINNING OF A TREND. THE FEVER HAS BROKEN AND REAL RETURN TO NORMALCY. RONALD REAGAN USED TO SAY, I TRUST IN THE WISDOM OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. BOTH SIDES HAVE SAID THAT FOR DECADES AND DECADES.  BUT NOT THE LAST FOUR YEARS.  NOT THE LAST FOUR YEARS. AGAIN, AS LINCOLN SAID, YOU CAN FOOL SOME OF THE PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME AND ALL OF THE PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME BUT NOT ALL OF THE PEOPLE ALL OF THE TIME. THAT'S WHAT HE WITH SAW REAFFIRMED THE OTHER DAY.  WE HAVE TO SNEAK IN A BREAK. WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE WITH EVERYBODY AFTER THAT SHORT BREAK. > PLUS, ONE OF THE BIG WINNERS FROM ELECTION NIGHT, DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT, JASMINE CROCKETT OF TEXAS HOW WOMEN AND YOUNG VOTERS HELPED POWER DEMOCRATS TO VICTORY ON TUESDAY. > LATER, MUCH MORE ON WHAT LOOKS LIKE A WIN FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN AND OUR ALLIES IN UKRAINE. THE RUSSIAN WITHDRAWAL IN THE STRATEGIC REGION OF KHERSON APPARENTLY TIMED BY MOSCOW UNTIL AFTER OUR MIDTERM ELECTIONS SO AS TO NOT HELP PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. \"DEADLINE WHITE HOUSE\" CONTINUES AFTER A QUICK BREAK. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. N'T GO ANYWHE. 20221110222306.163|20221110222632.853",

        "trs": "> AMONG THE KEYS TO DEMOCRATS' SUCCESS, HISTORICALLY SPEAKING THIS WEEK, THE SHEER MIGHT OF TWO GROUPS OF VOTERS. YOU HEARD THE PRESIDENT SHOUT THEM OUT DURING THE 3:00 HOUR HERE. FIRST, WOMEN. IN HOUSE RACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, THEY BROKE FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES BY EIGHT POINTS. THIS SECOND WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT. YOUNG VOTERS CUT UP THE NATIONAL PICTURE BY AGE. AMERICANS 65 YEARS AND OLDER FAVORED REPUBLICANS BY 12 POINTS. AMERICANS 45 YEARS OLD TO 64 BY 11 POINTS. THEN THE SHIFT COMES. VOTERS 30 TO 44 BROKE FOR DEMOCRATS BY FOUR. AND VOTERS UNDER 30, EXIT POLLS SHOW THEY FAVORED DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES BY 28 POINTS. REPUBLICANS DID HOLD THE LINE, FOR THE MOST PART, IN SOME STATES LIKE OHIO, FLORIDA AND TEXAS. BUT DEMOCRATS DID GET WINS IN THOSE STATES AS WELL. JOINING US, ONE OF THEM, A FAMILIAR FACE TO VIEWERS OF THIS PROGRAM, CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT, DEMOCRAT JASMINE CROCKETT. SHE WON HER RACE IN TEXAS BY A LOT, A LOT. IS THIS RIGHT? 75% OF THE VOTE? GOOD LORD, THAT IS A WHOOPING. THAT IS A HUGE MARGIN POLITICALLY SPEAKING. CONGRATULATIONS.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  SO, YOU'RE OFF TO CONGRESS. CAN'T SAY I'M SURPRISED. BUT WHAT MADE YOU THINK YOU COULD DO MORE GOOD THERE?  YOU KNOW, AS YOU TALK ABOUT TEXAS, OBVIOUSLY WE FIRST MET AS I WAS PUSHING BACK AGAINST RIDICULOUS POLICIES AND RIDICULOUS POLITICIANS, SUCH AS THE GOVERNOR, WHO WAS RE-ELECTED, UNFORTUNATELY, IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. AND, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A FORMER AMBASSADOR WHO ACTUALLY WATCHES YOUR SHOW ALL THE TIME. I THINK THAT WAS THE VERY FIRST TIME HE EVER SAW ME. HE CALLED ME ONE DAY AND HE SAYS, LISTEN, IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOME GOOD, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE IN TEXAS. AT LEAST WE KNOW THERE ARE POWER SHIFTS THAT OCCUR ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IF YOU WANT TO HELP YOUR CONSTITUENTS, YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AND HE'S RIGHT.  SO, WHAT ARE YOU EXCITED TO BE A PART OF? YOU KNOW, THE VOTING RIGHTS FIGHT IN WASHINGTON NEEDS YOUR ENERGY AND EXPERTISE, BUT WHAT ARE YOU HOPING TO DIVE INTO?  ACTUALLY, I'M GOING TO WORK ON THE ECONOMY A LOT. I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PROBABLY SHOCKED TO HEAR ME SAY THAT, BUT MY BACKGROUND IS IN BUSINESS. PRIOR TO ME GOING TO LAW SCHOOL, I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE A CPA. MY UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE IS IN BUSINESS. WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR IS TO BRING MORE FOLKS OUT OF ECONOMIC POVERTY. ALMOST 20% OF MY DISTRICT IS IN POVERTY. IF WE CAN START TO SOLVE THE POVERTY ISSUE, WE CAN START TO SOLVE THE EDUCATION ISSUES. WE CAN START TO SOLVE THE FOODS DESERT, THE MEDICAL DESERT ISSUES. I'LL BE FOCUSING A LOT ON MAKING SURE THERE'S EQUITY AS RELATES TO BLACK-OWNED BUSINESSES, LATINO-OWNED BUSINESSES, THINGS LIKE THAT, AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE ACTUALLY HAS ACCESS TO THE AMERICAN DREAM. THAT INCLUDES, NUMBER ONE, HAVING A GOOD PAYING JOB WITH GOOD WAGES AND HOPEFULLY HEALTH CARE AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE HOMEOWNERSHIP.  THAT'S THE TOP WAY TO DOING WHAT I WON'T BE SURPRISED TO SEEING YOU DO WHAT YOU DO, FORGING RELATIONSHIPS AROUND WHO CAN BE AGAINST THAT. IS THAT ON THE HORIZON FOR YOU? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?  NO, ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY KEEPS SAYING, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN? WHO'S GOING TO BE IN CONTROL? IF WE GET IN CONTROL, WE GET TO CODIFY ROE, WE GET TO MAKE SURE WE ARE LOOKING AT FINALLY REAUTHORIZING THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT THAT I WILL REMIND YOUR VIEWERS OF THE FACT THAT THAT WAS REAUTHORIZED IN A BIPARTISAN WAY, WAS NEVER DRAMA BEFORE. UNFORTUNATELY, IT'S CAUSED DRAMA NOW. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS WHAT HAS GIVEN A LITTLE BIT OF AN EDGE TO THE REPUBLICANS. BECAUSE IT WAS A REDISTRICTING YEAR. I THINK PUT FOR REDISTRICTING, I THINK THAT WE WOULD ALMOST BE GUARANTEED TO ACTUALLY HOLD ONTO THE HOUSE. BUT, OF COURSE, AS HAS ALREADY BEEN STATED, WE'RE GETTING MORE COLORFUL BY THE DAY. YOU KNOW, THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY COULD DRAW LINES AND CHEAT, AT LEAST WHAT THEY DID IN THE STATE OF TEXAS, TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN MAINTAIN POWER.  A LOT OF OUR CONVERSATIONS HAVE ALSO BEEN ABOUT ABORTION, TEXAS WITH ITS VIGILANTE ABORTION BAN, A CONVERSATION WE'VE BEEN HAVING A YEAR AND THREE MONTHS AGO AND ALSO AROUND DOBBS. HOW DO YOU THINK THOSE ISSUES PLAYED IN TEXAS, IN YOUR DISTRICT AND AROUND THE COUNTRY?  I THINK WE SAW IT PLAY, AS YOU LAID IT OUT. WHAT'S CRAZY IS THAT YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY, REALLY UNDERSTAND. THE OLD PEOPLE, MANY OF THEM ARE PAST THEIR CHILD-BEARING YEARS, OR SHOULD BE. THEY WERE THE ONES WRITING THIS LEGISLATION, OR EVEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SUPREME COURT. THE SUPREME COURT, MANY OF THEM ARE UP THERE IN AGE. IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY SAID, WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE, BUT THE YOUNG PEOPLE DECIDED TO SHOW THEIR POWER. HONESTLY, IT'S AN AREA THAT I DON'T THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE INVESTED IN VERY WELL. JUST LIKE I DON'T THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE INVESTED VERY MUCH IN THE MINORITY COMMUNITIES. BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY MATTER. I THINK THAT THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE STOOD UP FOR THEIR FUTURE, THEY'RE STANDING. FOR CLIMATE CHANGE, THEY'RE STANDING UP TO MAKE SURE THEY DO HAVE ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN MARRY WHOEVER THEY WANT TO MARRY. THESE ARE KIDS BORN WITH SO MANY MORE RIGHTS THAN MAYBE THEY HAVE TODAY, AND POTENTIALLY WHAT THEY WILL HAVE IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S NOT WHAT PROGRESS LOOKS LIKE. SO, I'M VERY EXCITED BY THE MOVEMENT THAT WE SEE WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. WE SEE MAXWELL FROST, ONE OF MY FAVORITE FOLK, THAT IS GOING TO BE COMING TO CONGRESS AT THE AGE OF 25. THERE IS NOTHING THAT THEY CAN'T DO WHEN THEY DECIDE THEY WANT TO DO IT. SO, I THINK THERE IS GOING TO BE A RECKONING SOON, WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY ARE GOING TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE EVEN MORE.  THERE IS NOTHING THAT THREATENS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S ABILITY TO WIN ELECTIONS FROM TODAY FORWARD THAN YOUNG VOTERS WAKING UP. THERE'S NO GRAVER THREAT.  ABSOLUTELY. IT'S AMAZING BECAUSE I THINK NEITHER PARTY REALLY EXPECTED TO HAVE TO ANSWER TO YOUNG VOTERS. AND YOU SEE THAT FROM BOTH PARTIES. IF THAT BEGINS TO CHANGE, EVEN IN AN EARNEST WAY IN RACES THAT MATTER, AND I WAS LOOKING AT THE MATH. WE WERE TALKING IN THE BREAK. IN MICHIGAN, GRETCHEN WHITMER, THE GOVERNOR WHO WAS RE-ELECTED, ABOUT 9% OF HER VOTES ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN COUNTY.  THAT'S INCREDIBLE.  AND FROM MICHIGAN STATE COMBINED. SO, THAT'S PRETTY INCREDIBLE. AND SO THE MORE THAT HAPPENS, THE MORE THEY SHOW UP, THE MORE WE'RE GOING TO SEE, I HOPE, SOME FUTURE-MINDED. WE DON'T PIT GENERATIONS AGAINST EACH OTHER. WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY, I BELIEVE.  PART OF THE REASON THAT SO MANY OF OUR POLICIES ARE SKEWED TOWARDS OLDER PEOPLE IS THAT THEY VOTE.  EXACTLY.  IF YOUNGER PEOPLE VOTED MORE, POLICIES WOULD BE ALIGNED WITH THEM. I MEAN, FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AND FOR THE DEMOCRATS IT'S ALL ABOUT TURNOUT. THE DEMOCRATIC CONSTITUENCY, COLLEGE EDUCATED, PEOPLE OF COLOR, IT'S ALL ABOUT TURNOUT. IF THEY ALL TURN OUT, THAT IS THE MAJORITY.  REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE IT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR, THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO VOTE.  EXACTLY.  THE BIGGEST THREAT IS UPPING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE. IT'S REMARKABLE. CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT, I'LL GET USED TO THAT, JASMINE CROCKETT, CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN AND THANK YOU FOR SPENDING TIME WITH US TODAY.  THANK YOU. GREAT TO SEE YOU. > AHEAD FOR US, THAT SUSPICIOUSLY TIMED RUSSIAN WITHDRAWAL IN THE KEY SOUTHERN PART OF UKRAINE. YOU MAY HAVE MISSED IT. IT HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS THIS WEEK. APPARENTLY TIMED BY MOSCOW BY VLADIMIR PUTIN SO AS NOT TO GIVE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN A WIN. THAT REMARKABLE STORY IS NEXT. 20221110224838.644|20221110225131.116",

        "trs": "> HOW DO YOU REASSURE THEM IF THAT IS THE REASON FOR THEIR QUESTIONING THAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT WILL NOT RETURN AND HIS POLITICAL MOVEMENT WHICH IS STILL VERY STRONG WILL NOT ONCE AGAIN TAKE POWER IN THE UNITED STATES?  WE JUST HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT HE WILL NOT TAKE POWER.  WHO DO YOU THINK WOULD BE THE TOUGHER COMPETITOR, RON DeSANTIS OR FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP, AND HOW IS THAT FACTORING INTO YOUR DECISION?  IT WILL BE FUN WATCHING THEM TAKE ON EACH OTHER.  OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF ATTENTION ON 2024 NOW THAT THE VOTES HAVE BEEN CAST IN THE MIDTERMS, 2/3 OF AMERICANS IN EXIT POLLS SAY THEY DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD RUN FOR REELECTION, WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO THEM, AND HOW DOES THAT FACTOR INTO YOUR FINAL DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO RUN FOR REELECTION?  IT DOESN'T.  WHAT'S YOUR MESSAGE TO THEM, 2/3 OF AMERICANS --  WATCH ME.  PRESIDENT BIDEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE YESTERDAY. WELCOME BACK TO \"MORNING JOE,\" IT IS THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 10th. KATTY KAY IS STILL WITH US, AND JOINING THE CONVERSATION, THE HOST OF MSNBC'S POLITICS NATION, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK, REVEREND AL SHARPTON.  HE MADE ME DEACON.  HE DID.  HEAD DEACON.  HEAD DEACON OF WHAT IS THE QUESTION.  ANYBODY THAT AT 6:50 IN THE MORNING, CAN PREACH THE GOOD SAMARITAN, DESERVES THAT.  SOUND LIKE YOU'VE GOT A GIG SUNDAY MORNING, YOU AND THE REV. AND FORMER UNITED STATES SENATOR, NOW AN MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST, CLAIRE McCASKILL, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY AND MSNBC HOST, JEN PSAKI. GOOD MORNING TO YOU ALL.  SO JEN, I SPOKE WITH SOMEONE CLOSE TO PRESIDENT BIDEN YESTERDAY.  HOW CLOSE?  REALLY CLOSE. NOT RELATED AND THEY DON'T WORK IN THE WHITE HOUSE, BUT THEY SPEAK TO HIM ALL THE TIME. THEY SAID EVEN AFTER HIS PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY, THERE WAS NEVER A SENSE OF JOY BECAUSE HE FELT THE RESPONSIBILITY. THERE WAS THIS CLOUD HANGING OVER EVERYTHING. SAID FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE STARTED RUNNING THE PRESIDENT SOUNDED JOYFUL.  YEAH.  HE SOUNDED HAPPY. HE SOUNDED RELIEVED. AND HE SOUNDED LIKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOOD PEOPLE, AND I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT, AND I FINALLY FEEL JUSTIFIED FOR ALL OF THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN TELLING ME I NEED TO, LIKE, JUST CRASH AND BURN AND DO WHAT TRUMP DOES. HE SAID, THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE. YOU CAN TRUST THEM.  YEAH, LOOK, I'VE TALKED TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND PEOPLE CLOSE TO PRESIDENT BIDEN TOO.  HOW CLOSE TO HIM?  VERY CLOSE. NOT RELATED. HE USED TO TALK WHEN I WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE HOW AFTER THE ELECTION OF 2020, THE NERVES WERE FRAYED. ALL OF OUR NERVES WERE FRAYED. HE DIDN'T GET TO ENJOY, THERE WAS NO BIG INAUGURATION, HE HAD TO DIVE INTO DEALING WITH NOT JUST THE CRISES BY THE CRAP THAT TRUMP LEFT BEHIND. REALLY COMING OUT OF THE OTHER NIGHT, NOT THAT HE WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT IN A MIDTERM ELECTION, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS FOR THAT FOR SURE. BUT ALSO, HIS AGENDA THAT HE FOUGHT LIKE HELL FOR. HE WORKED WITH DEMOCRATS ON TO DO SOMETHING ON CLIMATE CHANGE, TO LOWER COSTS FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC, BUILD BRIDGES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. TO FIGHT FOR ABORTION RIGHTS. THAT'S AN AGENDA PEOPLE LIKED AND THEY DIDN'T LIKE EXTREMISM. THAT FEELS GOOD. I WOKE UP FEELING GOOD AND HAPPY AND RELIEVED THAT SOME OF THE EXTREMIST NATURES OUT THERE WERE FOUGHT AGAINST AND VICTORIOUSLY SO.  RIGHT. AND WE WERE TALKING BEFORE ABOUT MICHIGAN. ABOUT THE SWINGIEST OF A SWING STATE THAT WENT OVERWHELMINGLY DEMOCRATIC AND IT WENT BLUE BECAUSE OF THE RADICALISM OF THE MAGA RIGHT OVER THE PAST FIVE, SIX YEARS. CLAIRE, YOU DIDN'T REPRESENT LIKE PARK SLOPE, I LOVE PARK SLOPE, BUT YOU DIDN'T REPRESENT PARK SLOPE. YOU REPRESENTED MISSOURI. AGAIN, A STATE THAT USED TO BE MORE OF A SWING STATE, AND WHO KNOWS IF RADICALISM ON THE RIGHT, IF REPUBLICANS DON'T LISTEN, IT WILL BE A SWING STATE. YOU GOT ELECTED BY DEALING WITH CONSERVATIVES, MODERATES, DEMOCRATS I'D LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER ABOUT JUST ON AMERICANS KIND OF GETTING IT.  YEAH, AND REMEMBER --  AGAIN, BY THE WAY, I'M SORRY, NOT BECAUSE DEMOCRATS DIDN'T GET BLOWN OUT. BUT GETTING IT BECAUSE THE MOST EXTREME ELEMENTS WERE WASHED AWAY.  EXACTLY. THE SCARIEST PEOPLE WERE PUT -- REJECTED BY THE VOTERS, AND YOU KNOW, THE MIDDLE OF AMERICA IN EVERY WAY, THE MIDDLE GEOGRAPHICALLY, AND THE MIDDLE IN TERMS OF THE IDEOLOGICAL SPECTRUM, THAT'S WHERE YOU MAKE MAJORITIES. YOU DON'T MAKE MAJORITIES ON THE ENDS. YOU MAKE MAJORITIES BY GETTING AS CLOSE AS YOU CAN TO THE SWEET SPOT OF COMMON AGREEMENT, AND THAT'S WHAT BIDEN DID. HE PASSED THINGS THAT WERE POPULAR. BACK IN 2010 WHEN I WAS DOING TOWN HALLS ALL OVER MISSOURI, TRUST ME WHEN I TELL YOU, OBAMA CARE WAS NOT POPULAR.  WE REMEMBER THE VIDEOS OF YOU IN THESE TOWN HALLS, BUT THE STUFF HE GOT DONE IS VERY VERY POPULAR. AND I THINK THAT HELPED. I CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER WITHOUT GIVING A SHOUT OUT TO COUNTY CLERKS AND BOARD OF ELECTION COMMISSIONERS IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, IT'S JUST THE COUNTY CLERKS THAT ARE ELECTED THAT RUN THESE ELECTIONS. AND IT'S BOARD OF ELECTION COMMISSIONERS TYPICALLY IN LARGER COMMUNITIES. YOU KNOW, WHAT THEY'VE DONE, THEY TRAINED, AND THEY'VE BEEN TRANSPARENT, SO WHEN DONALD TRUMP, REMEMBER ON ELECTION DAY HE PUT OUT THE CLARION CALL TO HIS PEOPLE, PROTEST, PROTEST, PROTEST, AND WHEN HE DID THAT BEFORE, JOE, PEOPLE SHOWED UP IN DETROIT TO PROTEST. AND THERE WERE SCARY LOOKING PEOPLE, MOBS OF THEM, WHEN HE SHOOK HIS FINGER, GET OUT THERE ON THE STREETS, PROTEST, THEY WENT. AND GUESS WHAT HAPPENED ON ELECTION DAY, NO ONE SHOWED UP AND PEOPLE CONCEDED AND THESE ELECTION BOARDS AND COUNTY CLERKS HAVE BEEN VERY TRANSPARENT, SHOWING EVERYONE HOW THEY DO IT. WELCOMING PEOPLE INTO THE PROCESS TO SEE EXACTLY HOW WE VOTE. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT HAPPENED ON TUESDAY, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WE HAVE NOT HAD CLAIMS OTHER THAN A FEW CRAZIES THAT SOMEHOW THIS ELECTION DOES NOT REPRESENT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.  DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ALIKE, THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT MICHIGAN BEFORE, WILLIE, ABOUT THE EXTREMISM THERE BUT I'M REMINDED OF THOSE MICHIGAN REPUBLICANS, WHEN TRUMP WAS TRYING TO STEAL THE VOTE IN 2020, PEOPLE WHOSE NAMES WE DON'T EVEN REMEMBER. NOT GOING TO DO THAT THERE. I REMEMBER THE REPUBLICANS IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AFTERWARDS GOING, NO, JUST LIKE MARICOPA COUNTY REPUBLICANS, JUST LIKE REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE GOING, NOPE, YOU GUYS ARE OUT OF YOUR MIND, THIS WAS A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION. JUST SHUT UP. I MEAN, THAT HAPPENED ALL ACROSS AMERICA THIS TIME. THERE WERE REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS INDEPENDENTS STANDING SHOULDER TO SHOULDER, PROTECTING DEMOCRACY. MAKING SURE IT RAN SMOOTHLY, AND IT DID.  I'M SO GLAD CLAIRE SHOUTED THEM OUT. THAT JOB WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT'S EVER BEEN, GIVEN EVERYTHING WE SAW OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. WE SAW IT YESTERDAY IN NEVADA WHEN THE REGISTRAR CAME OUT AND GAVE AN EXHAUSTIVE NEWS CONFERENCE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS EVERY DAY, HERE'S THE PROCESS, HERE'S HOW WE'RE DOING IT, HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO COME IN TOMORROW. IT DIDN'T MAKE A LOT OF PEOPLE HAPPY BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO TAKE A WEEK MAYBE IN NEVADA TO FIND OUT WHO WON, THEY'RE OPENING UP THE PROCESS TO EXPLAIN HOW IT'S GOING TO SORT OF KEEP AWAY THE VIRUS AND THE INFECTION AND THE SPACE THAT ALLOWS THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES TO FESTER.  HOW GREAT WERE THEY IN MARICOPA COUNTY. KARI LAKE GOES OUT AND LIES THROUGH HER TEETH, LIKE SHE DOES ABOUT ELECTIONS AND CONSPIRACY THEORIES. THEY PUT UP ON TWITTER. NOPE, EVERYTHING YOU WERE SAYING. IT'S LIKE LUKE SKYWALKER, AT THE END OF STAR WARS GOING, NOPE, EVERYTHING YOU JUST SAID IS WRONG. ONE, TWO, THREE. AND THEY WERE RESPONDING IN REALTIME. IT SORT OF WENT AWAY.  AND REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, HERE'S THE PROCESS, THERE'S NOTHING FISHY GOING ON HERE. WE DON'T KNOW FOR PEOPLE WAKING UP WHO'S WON RACES IN NEVADA AND ARIZONA. WE KNOW THAT GEORGIA IS GOING TO A RUNOFF WHICH PUTS THE FOCUS AND IMPORTANCE ON THE TWO STATES OUT WEST. WHICHEVER PARTY WINS BOTH, GEORGIA DOESN'T MEAN AS MUCH. HOW ARE DEMOCRATS FEELING BROADLY THIS MORNING TWO DAYS LATER?  I THINK CLEARLY DEMOCRATS ARE HAPPY THAT THE RED WAVE DID NOT HAPPEN. AND THERE IS A SENSE OF MAYBE WE ARE COMING BACK TO SOME SANE BORDERS IN AMERICAN POLITICS. WHEN YOU GET SO FAR OUT THERE, WE'RE ACTING AS IF PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING PROSECUTED FOR TRYING TO OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT WITH AN INSURRECTION PHYSICALLY THREATENING THE VICE PRESIDENTS AND MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN THE CAPITOL BUILDING, ALL THE WAY TO AN 82-YEAR-OLD MAN BEING HIT OVER THE HEAD IN HIS OWN HOME WITH A HAMMER BECAUSE HE'S MARRIED TO THE SPEAKER, WHEN WE BEGIN TO ACT LIKE THIS IS AMERICAN POLITICS, IT'S BAD, BUT LET ME TELL YOU, ON THE OTHER SIDE, FOR THOSE OF US THAT HAVE FOUGHT THESE CIVIL RIGHTS CASES THROUGH GEORGE FLOYD AND AHMAUD ARBERY, TO BE MISINTERPRETED, WE'LL SELF-POLICE, WHICH IS GOOD IF YOU LIVE IN A GATED COMMUNITY, BUT NOT IF YOU LIVE IN COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO DEAL WITH CRIME, ALL OF US CAN TAKE A SIGH OF RELIEF, WAIT A MINUTE, NOW WE'RE BACK IN BORDERS WHERE WE CAN DEPARTMENT AND WE CAN ARGUE AND WE CAN DEBATE IN MANY AGGRESSIVE WAYS, BUT IT HAS TO BE WITHIN THE LINES OF WHERE WE ARE CIVIL. AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE LIKE WES MOORE WIN, AND PEOPLE THAT WIN THAT DID NOT GO TO THE EXTREME LEFT OR RIGHT, I THINK IT HELPS CENTER THE COUNTRY, AND I THINK THAT'S WHY PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS SO HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS BECAUSE THAT'S WHY HE RAN, AND THAT'S WHY HE WON.  YOU MENTIONED HIM. LET'S TALK TO HIM. ONE OF THE ELECTION DAY'S BIGGEST STORIES COMING OUT OF MARYLAND WHERE DEMOCRAT WES MOORE HANDILY DEFEATED REPUBLICAN DAN COX. MOORE TOOK THE STAGE ON TUESDAY AFTER HIS WIN, AND TALKED ABOUT PATRIOTISM AND WHAT IT MEANS TO HIM.  THESE RESULTS ARE STILL ROLLING IN, RIGHT, BUT IT IS CLEAR Y'ALL GAVE US A MANDATE. SOMETHING ELSE IS VERY CLEAR TOO. TRUE PATRIOTISM IS ALIVE AND WELL IN MARYLAND, AND IT IS ALIVE AND WELL IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TOO. I GREW UP IN A FAMILY OF PEOPLE WHO LOVE THIS COUNTRY EVEN WHEN THE COUNTRY DIDN'T ALWAYS LOVE HIM BACK. AND MY ENTIRE LIFE HAS TAUGHT ME THAT PATRIOTISM DOES NOT MEAN WAVING A FLAG AROUND. IT DOESN'T MEAN TELLING OUR NEIGHBORS THAT WE'RE BETTER THAN THEM. REAL PATRIOTISM MEANS BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER. IT MEANS LIFTING PEOPLE UP. IT MEANS IMPROVING EACH OTHER'S LIVES. PATRIOTISM MEANS KNOWING THAT THIS COUNTRY IS GREAT, BUT IF WE WORK TOGETHER, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT EVEN GREATER BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE WILL BENEFIT FROM THAT.  AND MARYLAND'S GOVERNOR-ELECT, WES MOORE, JOINS US NOW. MR. GOVERNOR-ELECT, CALLING YOU THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME, WELCOME TO THE SHOW, CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU. FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW, YOU HAD NO POLITICAL EXPERIENCE, HADN'T RUN FOR ANYTHING. YOU CAME OUT OF A VERY CROWDED DEMOCRATIC FIELD WITH PEOPLE BETTER KNOWN INSIDE THE PARTY, PEOPLE WHO HAD RAISED MORE MONEY THAN YOU DID. YOU WON THE NOMINATION, AND THEN TWO NIGHTS AGO HANDILY DEFEATED THE REPUBLICAN THERE. WES, HOW DID YOU DO IT?  WE DID IT BY GOING OUT AND EARNING IT, BY GOING TO EVERY SINGLE PART OF THE STATE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S EXCITING FOR US ISN'T JUST THE WIN, IT'S HOW WE WON. WE WERE WINNING IN URBAN AREAS, IN RURAL AREAS, IN SUBURBAN AREAS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND THAT WE'VE GOT A COMMON GOAL. I REMEMBER SAYING ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL WHEN I WAS LEADING PARATROOPERS IN CONGRESS, DO YOU KNOW A QUESTION I NEVER ONCE ASKED MY SOLDIERS, WHAT'S YOUR POLITICAL PARTY BECAUSE IT DIDN'T MATTER. WE HAD ONE GOAL, ONE MISSION, AND THAT'S THE WAY WE LED THIS ENTIRE TIME. THIS IS GOING TO BE MARYLAND'S DECADE. MARYLAND IS GOING TO LEAD. MARYLAND IS GOING TO WIN. THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO DO IT IS TOGETHER. AND I THINK THAT MESSAGE RESONATED.  IT'S CLAIRE McCASKILL, FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS. YOU HAVE A DEAR FRIEND, JASON KANDER AND MANY OTHERS WHO SUPPORT U. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT CRIME. PUBLIC SAFETY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE WEDGE ISSUE USED BY REPUBLICANS. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ADDRESS WHAT HAS BECOME LEGITIMATELY A REAL CONCERN BY A WHOLE LOT OF FOLKS? ESPECIALLY LIVING AROUND URBAN AREAS ABOUT THE CRIME PROBLEM THAT YOU AND LOCAL PROSECUTORS ARE FACING IN MARYLAND.  THANK YOU, SENATOR. AND IT'S TRUE, AND I HAD TO COME OFF THE TRAIL EARLIER THIS YEAR BECAUSE A 69-YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER WHO'S A MEMBER OF MY CHURCH, WHO'S A CUSTODIAN IN THE CHURCH WAS KILLED IN THE CHURCH BATHROOM, AND I SPOKE AT HER VIGIL. THIS IS NOT JUST REAL, IT IS PERSONAL, AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE, AND THE COLLABORATIVE NATURE OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE. I THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM EVERYONE FROM PROGRESSIVE MARYLAND TO THE POLICE UNION, AND PEOPLE SAYING, HOW ARE YOU ABLE TO GET THAT COALITION TOGETHER? THE ANSWER IS BECAUSE I TOLD EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM THE SAME THING, I NEED YOU, AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE MY EAR. RIGHT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE THINGS THE STATE CAN UNIQUELY DO TO ADDRESS THAT, THE STATE HAS TO BE AGGRESSIVE IN KEEPING VIOLENT OFFENDERS OFF THE STREETS, AND KEEPING ILLEGAL GUNS OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THAT MEANS FIXING A BROKEN PROBATION SYSTEM, A THIRD OF VIOLENT OFFENDERS ARE VIOLATION OF PROBATION. WE ARE US AND CEASE FIRE, THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO THE CHALLENGE ARE THE ONES CLOSEST TO THE SOLUTIONS, AND MUCH OF THE VIOLENCE IS RETALIATORY. THE PROBLEM IS MOST OF THESE PROGRAMS AND INTERVENTIONS ARE EITHER UNDER FUNDED OR UNFUNDED, SO WE HAVE TO MOVE IN PARTNERSHIP TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT YOU NEED TO DEAL WITH CRIME AND PUBLIC SAFETY AS WE SEE IT NOW, BUT ALSO WE ARE NEVER GOING TO ARREST OR MILITARIZE OUR WAY OUT OF SOMETHING THAT'S A BIGGER, LARGER AND STRUCTURAL PROBLEM.  CONGRATULATIONS, THIS IS JEN PSAKI. WATCHING YOU HAS MADE ME EXCITED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. YOU CAMPAIGNED ACROSS THE STATE. TALKED TO REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS, WHAT ARE THE ISSUES YOU THINK YOU CAN WORK WITH REPUBLICANS ON IN YOUR STATE TO MAKE PROGRESS MOVING FORWARD AT THIS TIME WHEN WE'RE PRETTY POLARIZED AS A COUNTRY?  YES, THANK YOU, I THINK ONE THING PEOPLE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IN THE STATE IS THE ISSUE OF THE ECONOMY. AND PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE'RE GROWING AS AN ECONOMY, THAT IT'S PARTICIPATORY. EVERYONE HAS A CHANCE TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT. THE THING I'M EXCITED TO WORK ON IS HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE WE'RE GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. THAT MEANS THINGS LIKE FIXING A CHILD CARE SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND ALONE. WE HAVE HAD 750 CHILD CARE CENTERS CLOSE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE PROPER CHILD CARE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET PARTICIPANTS AND PARTICULARLY YOUNG PARENTS INTO THE WORK FORCE. WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON JOB RESKILLING AND TRAINING. WE WENT TOO FAR WHEN WE STARTED EVALUATING HIGH SCHOOLS, BASED ON THINGS LIKE FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE ACCEPTANCE RATES. THAT'S NOT THE PATH FOR EVERY STUDENT. I JOINED THE MILITARY WHEN I WAS 17 YEARS OLD. I WAS THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO HAS A TWO-YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE. SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE CREATING ECONOMIC PATHWAYS FOR ALL OF US. AND I THINK THE OTHER BIG THING IS, MARYLAND WILL BE THE FIRST STATE IN THIS COUNTRY TO HAVE A SERVICE YEAR OPTION FOR ALL HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT FOR THREE REASONS. IT HELPS TO ADDRESS THE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS, I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN EXEXPERIMENT SERVICE. THIS TIME OF VITRIOL, I HAVE -- THEY CAME TO DOOR KNOCK FOR ME, AND THEY WERE LITERALLY KNOCKING ON DOORS, AND TELLING PEOPLE LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE GUY I SERVED WITH. SERVICE WILL HELP TO SAVE US AND I BELIEVE DEEPLY MARYLAND WILL HELP TO LEAD THE WAY.  GOVERNOR-ELECT, AL SHARPTON, WE HAVEN'T TALKED SINCE YOU WON, BUT WE TALKED A LOT WHILE YOU WERE RUNNING AND DOWN THROUGH THE YEARS WORKED TOGETHER.  YES, SIR.  LET ME ASK YOU, AS ONE THAT HAS, IN MY OPINION, I AGREE WITH JEN THAT YOU PROBABLY ARE AT THE FOREFRONT OF A NEW ERA OF WHERE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY COULD GO, WHERE IS THAT MESSAGE? WHAT IS THAT MESSAGE THAT THE DEMOCRATS OUGHT TO TAKE INTO NOW GOING INTO PAST THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS INTO '24 AND BEYOND. WE'RE HEARING SOME HYSTERIA FROM THE RIGHT THAT I THINK LOST A LOT OF ITS VOLUME AND VIBRATION IN THE MIDTERM ELECTION, AND ON THE LEFT. HOW DO WE IDENTIFY THE MESSAGE THAT RESONATES NATIONALLY, AND USING A CASE STUDY OF WHAT YOU WERE ABLE TO DO IN MARYLAND?  WHEN I FIRST JOINED THE MILITARY, I WAS 17 YEARS OLD, AND WE LEARNED A MANTRA WHEN I FIRST JOINED, AND IT WAS SIMPLE. IT WAS LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND. EVER. RIGHT, YOU GET ONE OF MY PEOPLE, I WILL SEND A BATTALION TO GO GET THEM IF I HAVE TO, AND I WAS CLEAR ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. THAT IS NOT JUST A MANTRA. THAT IS MY VALUE STATEMENT, AND IT IS NOT JUST A VALUE STATEMENT COME JANUARY. THAT IS GOING TO BE THE NEW MISSION OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND. WE WILL BE A STATE THAT LEAVES NO ONE BEHIND. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE SPEAKING TO EVERYBODY AND KNOW WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR COLLECTIVE VISION FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH, OUR COLLECTIVE VISION FOR WORK AND WAGES AND WEALTH FOR ALL MARYLANDERS, I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT WE'RE SPEAKING TO EVERYBODY. WE'RE SPEAKING TO THE BIOTECH ENTREPRENEUR, AND WE'RE SPEAKING TO THE WATERMAN, AND WE'RE SPEAKING TO THE CORRECTIONS OFFICER AND WE'RE SPEAKING TO THE FARMER. WE'RE SPEAKING TO EVERYBODY, AND I THINK WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS IDEA WHO LOVES THIS COUNTRY OR WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A PATRIOT TO BE DOMINATED BY A GROUP OR AN INDIVIDUAL OR A PARTY WHOSE DEFINITION OF DEFENDING DEMOCRACY IS TRYING TO TEAR IT DOWN. YOU KNOW, MY DEFINITION DEFINIT PATRIOTISM, SERVING WITH PARATROOPERS, AND TEACHERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS, THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND FIGHT FOR IT. WE CANNOT ALLOW OR SEE THAT POSITION TO ANYBODY.  MARYLAND'S GOVERNOR-ELECT, WES MOORE. GIVE OUR BEST TO THE FIRST LADY AS WELL.  THANK YOU, ALL.  YOU SEE WES MOORE, YOU SEE JOSH SHAPIRO, A LONG LIST, GRETCHEN WHITMER, GOING DOWN, SUDDENLY THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY FEELS PRETTY GOOD TO A LOT OF DEMOCRATS.  A LOT OF DEMOCRATS HAVE TO BE EXCITED. YOU LOOK AT A GUY LIKE WES MOORE, A GUY WE HAVE KNOWN FROM THE BEGINNING, CAME ON THE SHOW A LONG TIME AGO WHEN WE WERE ASKING ABOUT AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ, HE SERVED THERE. HE'S A GUY WHO, AGAIN, REACHING OUT TO BOTH SIDES, TALKING TO PROGRESSIVE ACTIVISTS AT THE SAME TIME, GOING AND TALKING TO COPS, SAYING I'M WITH YOU. WE'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS TOGETHER BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DO THIS TOGETHER. FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. I LOVE WHAT HE SAID ABOUT FOUR-YEAR UNIVERSITIES AND FOCUSING ON, YOU KNOW, GETTING PEOPLE INTO THE MOST ELITE SCHOOLS. HE SERVED AT 17, WENT TO A TWO-YEAR COLLEGE, I MEAN, THAT'S GREAT. HARRY TRUMAN, HE WENT TO SPAULDING COMMERCIAL COLLEGE, RIGHT, AND DID MORE TO SHAPE THE FUTURE OF THE POST WAR WORLD THAN ANYBODY, AND KATTY KAY, YOU LOOK AT THIS GUY, NOT AN IDEOLOGUE, NOT AN ELITIST, HE'S INCLUSIVE, AND MAN, THAT IS A MESSAGE THAT EVERY POLITICIAN SHOULD TAKE NOTE OF.  YEAH, HE'S ECHOING JOHN FETTERMAN, ISN'T HE, WITH EVERY COUNTY, EVERY VOTE, AND MAKING SURE HE GOES OUT TO THE RURAL AREAS OF MARYLAND AS WELL. IF YOU LOOK AT WES MOORE'S BACKGROUND, HE WORKED IN INVESTMENT BANKING ON WALL STREET. HE ALSO IS A SCHOLAR AT OXFORD. IT'S HIS MILITARY SERVICE AND TIME AT A NONPROFIT IN NEW YORK, THAT HE DRAWS ON OR DREW ON IN THE COURSE OF HIS CAMPAIGN. THE HUMANITY THAT CAME ACROSS IN HIS BOOK, THE OTHER WES MOORE, HE FINDS SOMEONE IN PRISON WHO HAS HIS NAME, AND HE BRINGS THAT TO THE TRAIL. IT IS EXCITING TO LOOK AT SOMEONE LIKE WES WHO WE HAVE ALL KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME. I WAS JUST WRITING DOWN ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HE'S DONE, AND HOW HE'S NOW BRINGING THOSE INTO HIS SERVICE. IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO WATCH SOMEONE LIKE HIM. MARYLAND IS A PRETTY DEMOCRATIC STATE, A PRETTY LIBERAL STATE. THERE ARE RURAL AREAS, BUT IT RELIABLY VOTES DEMOCRATIC ON A STATE-WIDE LEVEL, AND IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO WATCH HOW HE WOULD MAKE A TRANSITION FROM MARYLAND TO A STATE LIKE WISCONSIN, TO A STATE LIKE ARIZONA, IF YOU COULD THROW IT BACK IN THE MIDST, HOW WOULD WES MOORE MAKE THAT TRANSITION ON TO A NATIONAL STAGE LEVEL. I'M SURE HE HAS AMBITIONS TO DO THAT, AND IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHETHER HE HAS A PATH.  WE LOOK AT THE WAY DEMOCRATS WERE FEELING THREE NIGHTS AGO, THERE WAS A SENSE OF DREAD, YOU CAN SAY IT PUBLICLY. HOW BAD IS THIS GOING TO BE IN THE HOUSE.  BRACING FOR IMPACT.  BRACING FOR IMPACT. AND YESTERDAY MORNING YOU AND OTHERS CAME ON THE SHOW WITH SMILES ON YOUR FACES. YES, THE HOUSE VERY WELL MAY BE GONE, AND MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE MAY BRING IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES AND THE REST OF THAT, BUT YOU'RE EXPRESSING HOPE FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED TUESDAY.  I WILL SAY, EVEN GOING INTO TUESDAY NIGHT, LOOKING AT PEOPLE LIKE WES MOORE, AND OTHER CANDIDATES RUNNING, SOME WHO LOST, THERE ARE A LOT OF GREAT CANDIDATES, A BIG BENCH FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, CANDIDATES PEOPLE ARE GENUINELY EXCITED ABOUT. THAT IS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER SIDE, RIGHT, WHERE THE EXCITEMENT IS AROUND EXTREMISM, AND SO IT IS EXCITING TO WATCH. WE DONE KNOW WHAT SPEAKER PELOSI IS GOING TO DO. SHE IS A FIERCE FORCE OF NATURE, AND WHEN SHE LEAVES, IT WILL BE A HUGE LOSS. SHE HAS LEFT THAT DOOR OPEN. REGARDLESS. THERE'S GOING TO BE GENERATIONAL CHANGE IN THE HOUSE LEADERSHIP AS WELL. THESE ARE PEOPLE WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET TO KNOW WHO THEY ARE, WHAT THEY STAND FOR, WHAT THEIR BACKGROUNDS ARE. IT'S GOING TO BRING EXCITING DIVERSE FACES INTO THE CONVERSATION. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE EXCITED ABOUT.  JEN PSAKI, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU. STILL AHEAD ON \"MORNING JOE,\" WE'LL TALK TO ONE NEW YORK DEMOCRAT WHO FOUGHT OFF A DIFFICULT CHALLENGE FROM HIS REPUBLICAN OPPONENT. > WE'LL BE JOINED BY SEAN PATRICK MALONEY, WHO WAS NOT AS FORTUNATE IN HIS RACE.

        "trs": "> THE VOTERS SPOKE CLEARLY ABOUT THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT RAISING COSTS, THE RISING COSTS AND THE NEED TO GET INFLATION DOWN. THERE'S STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE HURTING. THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED. AND IT'S ABOUT CRIME AND PUBLIC SAFETY. AND THEY SENT A CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE MESSAGE THAT THEY WANT TO PRESERVE OUR DEMOCRACY AND PROTECT THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE IN THIS COUNTRY.  LET'S BRING IN RIGHT NOW U.S. HOUSE SENATOR OF THE NONPARTISAN COOK POLITICAL REPORT DAVE WASSERMAN. FOUR KIDS, I HAVE SEEN \"THE LION KING\" ABOUT 87 TIMES, AND THERE'S THAT SCENE WHERE MUFASA SHOWS UP IN THE CROWD, AND RITIKI SAYS WHAT WAS THAT. THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING ABOUT THIS ELECTION. WHAT WAS THAT? YOU CALLED IT THE CRAZIEST ELECTION YOU HAVE EVER SEEN IN YOUR LIFETIME. LIKE, CAN YOU EVEN SORT THROUGH WHAT HAPPENED A COUPLE OF NIGHTS YET?  YEAH, I THINK WE CAN, JOE, AND BY THE WAY, JOE, ROLL THE TAPE. ON MONDAY, I TOLD YOU, I DIDN'T THINK THE BOTTOM WAS DROPPING OUT FOR DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE, AND IT TURNED OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE GOT CARRIED AWAY OUT DOOMING EACH OTHER ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.  RIGHT.  IT'S CRAZY. THIS WAS A VERY UNEVEN MIDTERM LANDSCAPE. WE HAD DEMOCRATS DOING TERRIBLY IN FLORIDA AND NEW YORK, BUT THEY WERE DOING GREAT IN A LOT OF OTHER PLACES, SWEEPING THE COMPETITIVES IN MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE IF YOU PUT YOURSELF IN THE SHOES OF A VOTER IN MICHIGAN WHO HAS BEEN SEEING ARMED MILITIAS TRYING TO KIDNAP THE GOVERNMENT. IF YOU'RE IN NEW YORK STATE, AND DEMOCRATS CONTROL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, A LOT OF VOTERS HELD DEMOCRATS DOUBLY RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING THEY'RE DISSATISFIED WITH IN THEIR LIVES, SO REALLY A WEIRD CYCLE.  WE WERE SAYING THE SAME THING. IT JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A WAVE ELECTION, AND YET, HOW STRANGE IF THE DEMOCRATS LOSE THE HOUSE AS \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTS THIS MORNING IT MAY BE BECAUSE OF TWO OF THE BLUEST STATES IN AMERICA, BECAUSE OF NEW YORK AND BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IN NEW YORK, OF COURSE, THE GOVERNOR SURVIVED, BUT HER CAMPAIGN, I'M SORRY, GOT TO SAY IT, HER CAMPAIGN DID NOT DO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ANY FAVORS. WE'VE GOT ONE HERE WHO BARELY GOT OUT ALIVE.  THAT'S RIGHT. AND LOOK, IN NEW YORK, WE HAD PRETTY MUCH A WIPE OUT EXPECT FOR PAT RYAN IN THE HUDSON VALLEY, AND PRETTY MUCH EVERY RACE EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI IS PRETTY CLEAR AT THIS POINT, WE'VE STILL GOT 30 RACES THAT STILL NEED TO BE SORTED OUT, AND I'M LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW, A ROUGH COUNT RIGHT NOW OF 210 REPUBLICANS. 195 DEMOCRATS THAT ARE BASICALLY CALLABLE. WE'VE GOT 13 OUTSTANDING OF THE 30 THAT I THINK ARE LEANING TO DEMOCRATS AT THIS POINT. EIGHT THAT ARE LEANING TO REPUBLICANS AND THEN THE NINE WHO ARE IN THAT WHO KNOWS CATEGORY RIGHT NOW. ARIZONA, 1, 47, 49, SO FIVE OF THOSE IN CALIFORNIA. COLORADO, THREE. WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT LAUREN BOEBERT WOULD BE IN A BARN BURNER AND A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ARE PREMATURELY DOING A VICTORY DANCE THERE, BUT THIS IS STILL TIGHT AS A TICK, AND WASHINGTON THREE, AND WASHINGTON EIGHT. SO LOOK, I THINK REPUBLICANS LAND AROUND 220 TO 225, SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE. THE QUESTION ALL ALONG HAS BEEN WOULD KEVIN McCARTHY HAVE A TRUE GOVERNING MAJORITY OR WOULD HE JUST HAVE A MARJORIE, MEANING THE MAJORITY IS SO THIN, HE CAN'T CIRCUMVENT THE FAR RIGHT FRINGE OF THE PARTY TO GET BASIC THINGS DONE.  THE RACE EVERYONE WAS CALLING A BELLWETHER, ABBY SPANBERGER IN VIRGINIA, SEVEN, A STATE YOU KNOW WELL. A REMARKABLE PERFORMANCE, WE SPOKE WITH HER YESTERDAY AND SAID, MAN, I HAD NO IDEA WHEN 77% WAS IN, AND YOU WERE SO FAR DOWN THAT YOU WERE GOING TO COME BACK. THEY RAN A MASSIVE CAMPAIGN. SHE GOES, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE HIT EVERY NUMBER WE HAD TO HIT IN EVERY COUNTY, SO WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS THINKING WE WERE GOING TO LOSE, WE WERE LIKE, WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE. WE'RE GOING TO PULL THIS OUT. INCREDIBLE.  YOU KNOW WHAT'S SO IMPRESSIVE ABOUT THAT, JOE, 3/4 OF THE DISTRICT WAS NEW. REDISTRICTING WAS BIG. SHE WENT OUT AND WORKED THOSE PLACES. A BIG REASON WHY THE OF THE DCCC WAS IN TROUBLE. HE WAS FOCUSED ON HELPING DEMOCRATS AROUND THE COUNTRY, NOT JUST HIMSELF. REPUBLICAN MIKE WALLER WAS THE ONE WHO HAD A LOT MORE TIME TO SPEND ON THAT RACE. KATIE PORTER IN CALIFORNIA, ALSO A MAJORITY NEW DISTRICT. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE HOW THINGS SHAKE OUT THERE. THAT RACE IS NOT OVER.  BEFORE WE LET YOU GO, WE'VE COME TO APPRECIATE YOUR CATCH PHRASE, I'VE SEEN ENOUGH, WHEN YOU'VE CALLED A RACE. AS WE TALK ABOUT THE STATE OF ARIZONA, KORNACKI WAS BREAKING DOWN WHEN WE MIGHT GET VOTE ON THE GOVERNOR AND SENATOR'S RACE THERE. WHAT'S YOUR TIME LINE ON THAT? HOW CLOSELY ARE YOU WATCHING, AND WHEN DO YOU THINK WE MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING THERE.  I WOULD RATHER BE MARK KELLY THAN BLAKE MASTERS, AND KARI LAKE THAN KATIE HOBBS AT THIS POINT, BUT THE MAIL DROP OUT OF MARICOPA LAST NIGHT WAS PRETTY GOOD FOR DEMOCRATS. WE'VE STILL GOT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS LEFT TO COUNT THERE, AND, YOU KNOW, I'D RATHER BE MARK KELLY THAN CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO. WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN NEVADA, DEMOCRATS WILL PROBABLY PREVAIL IN THE HOUSE RACES BUT THE SENATE RACE THERE, STILL VERY TIGHT.  WE WILL SEE. DAVE WASSERMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. > PAT RYAN OF NEW YORK REPRESENTS THE STATE'S NEWLY REDRAWN 18th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IN THE HUDSON VALLEY, AND HE IS THE PROJECTED WINNER IN HIS RACE OVER REPUBLICAN COLIN SMITH.  THE LONE SURVIVOR.  HERE HE IS. CONGRESSMAN, YOU HAD TO RUN IN AUGUST, NO EXHALING FOR YOU AFTER WINNING THE SPECIAL IN AUGUST. YOU HAD TO TURN RIGHT AROUND AND START YOUR CAMPAIGN TO WIN AGAIN NOW. A CLOSE RACE. HOW DID YOU DO IT? WHAT WERE THE ISSUES AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT WERE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE VOTERS IN YOUR DISTRICT?  TO HAVE TWO TIGHT VICTORIES IN SIX MONTHS FEELS REALLY GOOD, AND I THINK IT SPEAKS TO THE FACT IN BOTH OF OUR RACES WE HAVE THE SAME MESSAGE, WE HAVE TO FIGHT TO PROTECT FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, STARTING WITH ABORTION RIGHTINGS -- RIGHTS AND WE HAVE TO DELIVER ECONOMIC RELIEF. WE HAVE TO SHOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO AUTHENTICALLY FIGHT ON BOTH OF THOSE. WHAT YOU STAND FOR IS IMPORTANT, BUT REALLY SHOWING THAT GRIT, WORKING IT HARD EVERY DOOR, EVERY ANGLE, EVERYTHING YOU CAN IN THESE TIGHT DISTRICTS. I THINK THAT'S HOW WE WERE ABLE TO SQUEAK IT OUT.  THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. CLAIRE KNOWS THIS SO WELL, FOR HARD WORK. NO SUBSTITUTE. AND PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT YOU AND GO, OH, MY GOD, POOR GUY, HE HAD A SPECIAL IN AUGUST, AND HAD TO RUN AGAIN. YOU WERE THERE WITH THE PEOPLE NONSTOP. YOU HAD NO OTHER CHOICE. HOW MUCH DID THAT ACTUALLY HELP YOU THAT PEOPLE HAD SEEN YOU AT THEIR DOORS, PLANTING YARD SIGNS, GOING TO COMMUNITY CENTERS, PRETTY MUCH NONSTOP FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS.  YEAH, WELL, I LEARNED DAY ONE AT WEST POINT, NO EXCUSE FOR HARD WORK, AND JUST WORKING AND PUTTING IN THAT EFFORT: OUR VICTORY IN THE SPECIAL ELECTION ALLOWED ME IN A NEW DISTRICT, ABOUT 50% NEW DISTRICT AT TWO MONTHS TO GET TO KNOW SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND FOLKS, BEING ABLE TO SHOW OUR MESSAGE CLEARLY, STRONGLY, COMING OUT OF THE SPECIAL WIN IN AUGUST MATTERED A LOT.  CONGRESSMAN, FIRST OF ALL, CONGRATULATIONS.  THANK YOU.  AS A VETERAN OF MANY MANY VERY CLOSE ELECTIONS, I FEEL HOW EXHAUSTED YOU ARE, AND ALSO HOW HAPPY YOU ARE THAT IT ALL PAID OFF. I'M ON A THEME THIS MORNING, AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR, THEY HAVE IN MANY INSTANCES USED CRIME UNFAIRLY BUT EFFECTIVELY TO TRY TO MAKE IT A WEDGE BETWEEN DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS. SOME DEMOCRATS UNFORTUNATELY HAVE PLAYED INTO THAT TACTIC. OTHERS HAVE FOUGHT BACK. LEANED INTO CRIME. TELL ME ABOUT CRIME IN YOUR RACE, AND HOW YOU DEALT WITH THAT ISSUE?  AND THIS WAS HUGE IN NEW YORK AS WE'VE HEARD. WE LEANED IN AND TALKED ABOUT WHAT I'VE ACTUALLY DONE. FROM WEARING THE UNIFORM IN COMBAT FOR 27 MONTHS TO INCREASING FUNDING TO OUR POLICE, AND ACTUALLY BRINGING DOWN VIOLENT CRIME LEVELS IN OUR AREA. SO I THINK YOU CAN'T LEAVE A VACUUM IN A SPACE FOR WHAT THE FAR RIGHT IS DOING, WHICH THEN IS LYING. I MEAN, THE NATIONAL REPUBLICANS SPENT ALMOST $5 MILLION BLATANTLY LYING ABOUT MY RECORD, AND AT A CERTAIN POINT, IF YOU SEED THAT GROUND, CERTAINLY PEOPLE IF YOU'RE NOT GIVING THEM THE TRUTH HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE. I THINK WE HAVE TO LEAN IN, AND AGAIN, JUST TALK ABOUT RECORD RATHER THAN -- AND TALK ABOUT IT AUTHENTICALLY.  AND YOU FUNDED THE COPS AND TOLD PEOPLE YOU FUNDED THE COPS, AND THEY LISTENED.  THE BIPARTISAN INVEST TO PROTECT ACT, WHICH WE HAD TO FIGHT TO GET SUPPORT FROM SOME OF MY DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES IN CONGRESS WAS SO IMPORTANT IN MY DISTRICT, THAT'S $500 MILLION IN FUNDING TO SMALL AND MEDIUM POLICE DEPARTMENTS UNDER 125 OFFICERS, ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT'S A GAME CHANGING THING TO HELP ESPECIALLY THESE SMALLER AGENCIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO DO AN INCREASINGLY DIVERSE SET OF MISSIONS. SO THAT WAS IMPACTFUL.  DEMOCRAT PAT RYAN OF NEW YORK, CONGRATULATIONS.  THANK YOU.  CONGRESSMAN SAID HE CAN NOW FINALLY ACTUALLY MAYBE RENT AN APARTMENT IN WASHINGTON AND DO SOME PLANNING NOW.  THE SAD THING, GUESS WHAT HE HAS TO DO NEXT WEEK. FUNDRAISING FOR THE NEXT ELECTION.  I'M BRINGING MY WIFE ON VACATION. > POLITICAL STRATEGIST, FRANK LUNTZ. THE LEGEND HOLDING UP, FLORIDA, FLORIDA, FLORIDA, FOR A WHILE, WE THOUGHT WISCONSIN, WISCONSIN, WISCONSIN, MAN, WE HAVE BEEN TALKING THIS MORNING ABOUT MICHIGAN, MICHIGAN, MICHIGAN. HERE YOU HAVE A SWING STATE, ONE THAT DONALD TRUMP WON, IN '16 ALMOST WON AGAIN. A LOT OF DEMOCRATS THOUGHT WERE GOING TO GET AWAY FROM HIM SIX MONTHS AGO, AND THE EXTREMISM, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TAKING AR-15s TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE. ATTEMPTING TO KIDNAP THE GOVERNOR, A CANDIDATE TALKING ABOUT A 14-YEAR-OLD GIRL BEING RAPED BY AN UNCLE AND BEING A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY THERE COULD BE NO EXCEPTIONS. I MEAN, ALL OF THAT EXTREMISM LED TO A MASSIVE BLUE WAVE IN MICHIGAN. AND THIS MORNING, YOU'VE GOT THE \"NEW YORK POST,\" THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" OPINION PAGE, ONE AFTER ANOTHER TALKING ABOUT TURNING THEIR BACK ON TRUMPISM, AND TURNING THEIR BACK ON EXTREMISM. SO WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THE OTHER NIGHT AND DO YOU THINK THIS IS A CORRECTIVE ELECTION?  MY TAKE IS THAT VOTERS WANT COMMON SENSE AND THEY WANT RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT, AND THAT'S NOT IDEOLOGICAL. THAT'S NOT POLITICAL. THAT'S SIMPLY GETTING THE JOB DONE. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR RESULTS. THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS . THEY'RE NOT LOOKING FOR THE KIND OF POLITICS WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS, AND YOU SEE MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSIN, THOSE ARE ALL THE THREE KEY STATES FOR 2024, BUT I STILL WANT TO LOOK BACKWARD. THE PEOPLE I TALKED TO OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS HAVE ESSENTIALLY SAID ENOUGH DONALD TRUMP. ENOUGH OF THIS CHAOS. ENOUGH OF THE YELLING AND SCREAMING. THEY LOOK AT THE U.S. SENATE AND THEY'RE MAD AT THE FORMER PRESIDENT. THEY THINK HE SUPPORTED THE WRONG CANDIDATES. HIS ENDORSEMENT STILL MATTERS WITHIN THE GOP, BUT THEY'RE FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY THINK HE IS SUPPORTING CANDIDATES THAT ARE SIMPLY UNELECTABLE, AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I DON'T THINK THAT ARIZONA ENS COME FOR THE REPUBLICANS. I THINK THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ENOUGH OF A LEAD. ANOTHER TRUMP ENDORSED CANDIDATE HAS FAILED. IF RON DeSANTIS IS THE BIG WINNER AMONG REPUBLICANS BECAUSE OF HOW HE GOVERNED IN FLORIDA, THEN DONALD TRUMP AT LEAST TO PEOPLE WHO I TALKED TO, THEY'RE ALL TELLING ME ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. MR. PRESIDENT, IT'S TIME TO GO AWAY.  FRANK, IT'S KATTY KAY HERE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR POLLING WAS TELLING YOU AND YOUR FOCUS GROUPS WERE TELLING YOU RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION, WHETHER ABORTION WAS APPARENT TO YOU AS A DRIVING FORCE TO THE EXTENT THAT WE SAW IT IN CERTAIN STATES, BUT WE SAW, YOU KNOW, IN A STATE LIKE MICHIGAN, OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A BIG STUDENT POPULATION IN ANN ARBOR, STUDENTS WERE STANDING IN LINE FOR TWO HOURS, AND THEY WERE VOTING UNIQUELY ON THAT ABORTION ISSUE. THROW THAT FORWARD TO US TWO YEARS, HOW MUCH OF A FACTOR COULD THAT BE IN ITS ABSENCE IN A SENSE IN THE ELECTION OF 2024 FOR DEMOCRATS? WHAT KIND OF THINGS DO THEY NEED TO DO, THE LESSONS FROM THIS ELECTION TO KIND OF EXTRAPOLATE TO 2024, AND HOW THEY CAN MOTIVATE THOSE PEOPLE TO GET OUT AGAIN AND CUE FOR THEM AGAIN IF ABORTION IS NOT ON THE BALLOT AS IT WON'T BE IN MICHIGAN IN 2024, FOR EXAMPLE.  IT'S A FANTASTIC QUESTION. IT'S FRIGHTENING. I HAVEN'T RECOVERED. I STILL HAVE TROUBLE TALKING FROM THE 2022 ELECTION AND WE'RE LOOKING AHEAD TO 2024. WE HAD AN EARLY WARNING OF KANSAS, A REPUBLICAN STATE, A CONSERVATIVE STATE, AND YET THEIR EFFORTS TO RESTRICT ABORTION BACK FIRED AND IT WAS VERY HARMFUL FOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES, AND IN FACT THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR WAS REELECTED THERE. THERE'S A LESSON FOR REPUBLICANS, AND THE VOTE I'M MOST FASCINATED WITH ARE INDEPENDENTS. THEY BROKE FOR DEMOCRATS BY 1% TUESDAY NIGHT. AND THAT 1% ENABLED THEM TO BASICALLY GET TO A 50/50 SENATE AND A 50/50 HOUSE. IF INDEPENDENTS DON'T BREAK FOR REPUBLICANS BY AT LEAST 55/45, THE DEMOCRAT WINS, AND ABORTION IS AN ISSUE THAT NON-IDEOLOGICAL VOTERS CARE ABOUT. IT'S A SOCIAL ISSUE, IT'S NOT AN ECONOMIC ISSUE. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT INFLATION AND THE ECONOMY, REPUBLICANS DO WELL. IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOCIAL ISSUES AND ABORTION, DEMOCRATS DO WELL.  FRANK, AL SHARPTON. ONE OF THE THINGS I TOOK AWAY FROM SOME OF THE BREAK DOWN FROM THE VOTE YESTERDAY IS YOUNG PEOPLE CAME OUT IN MANY AREAS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED. AND BLACK AND BROWN VOTERS AND A LOT OF IT I THINK IN PARTICULAR WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WAS THE ABORTION ISSUE. AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IS IN FRONT OF THE SUPREME COURT, OTHER SOCIAL CONCERNS MAY HAVE BACKFIRED AND BROUGHT OUT A LARGER THAN EXPECTED TURNOUT DURING THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS.  REVEREND, THIS IS WORTHY OF ITS OWN SEGMENT. THERE IS A SPLIT BETWEEN THE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES THAT IS SIGNIFICANT. HISPANIC AND LATINO VOTERS MOVED TOWARDS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN BIGGER NUMBERS THAN THEY HAVE AT ANY POINT. DEMOCRATS ONLY GOT 55% OF THE BROWN, OF THE HISPANIC LATINO POPULATION, AND I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL IF THE REPUBLICANS CAN KEEP THAT VOTE, THEY'RE IN A STRONG POSITION FOR 2024. THE DEMOCRATS CONTINUE TO LOSE THAT HISPANIC LATINO VOTE. IT PUTS THEM IN A PERILOUS POSITION. MAKE NO MISTAKE, IT'S NOT THAT THEY LOVE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THEY ARE REJECTING WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN WITH THE DEMOCRATS. THEY FEEL IGNORED, FORGOTTEN AND THEY FEEL LEFT BEHIND. BLACK LIVES MATTER HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN GALVANIZING THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE BUT THE LATINO COMMUNITY DOES NOT FEEL PART OF THAT, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS REPUBLICANS DID QUITE WELL IN FLORIDA AND QUITE WELL IN TEXAS.  FRANK LUNTZ, THANK YOU SO MUCH. GREATLY APPRECIATE IT. FRANK SAYING SOMETHING ON THE AIR THAT I HEAR EVERY DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST TELL ME AND SOMETHING THAT REV AND I TALK ABOUT ALL THE TIME. BUT, YOU KNOW, WILLIE, IT IS FASCINATING THAT, YES, THE HISPANIC VOTE BROKE MORE REPUBLICAN. AND YOU WOULD THINK, OKAY, WELL, WAIT, REPUBLICANS GOT 45% OF THE HISPANIC VOTE, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG NIGHT. AGAIN, WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE, THERE WAS A MIGRATION, HISPANIC VOTERS GOING REPUBLICAN OUT OF DEFAULT. AS DAVID SHORE SAID A COUPLE O YEARS AGO, DEMOCRATIC PARTY GOT TOO PROGRESSIVE FOR A LOT OF HISPANICS. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE A CORRECTIVE HERE. WE HAVE A LOT OF SUBURBAN WOMEN, A LOT, IN '16, '18, '20. MOVING TOWARD THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT VOTED REPUBLICAN THEIR ENTIRE LIFE. THINK OF WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS SAYING PRE-DOBBS. WE'RE GOING TO LOSE THE SUBURBS. HE WAS AGAINST THAT. IT MADE A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE.  HE WAS RIGHT ABOUT THAT, AND THE NARRATIVE, CLAIRE, THAT ABORTION HAD SOCIETY AS AN ISSUE OVER THE SUMMER, IT WAS WHITE HOT, AND MAYBE IT WENT AWAY AND IT WAS ABOUT CRIME AND THE ECONOMY. JUST WASN'T BORN OUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EXIT POLLS.  THAT WAS MOSTLY MAN EXPLAINING THAT WAS GOING ON THAT IT WASN'T A BIG ISSUE. WOMEN WEREN'T SAYING THAT. AND SECONDLY, I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD FORGET FOR THE SUBURBAN WOMEN, THE SHOOTINGS IN SCHOOLS, THE MASS SHOOTINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE IMPACTED SUBURBAN MOTHERS I THINK IN A REALLY PERSONAL WAY, AND THEY ARE TIRED OF THIS COUNTRY NOT DOING MORE ON GUN SAFETY AND THEY KNOW THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THE ONE THAT WILL PUSH THAT ISSUE.  AND ON THAT ISSUE, IT IS SO FASCINATING, WILLIE, THAT WE HAVE FRIENDS THAT ARE YOUNGER WHO ARE PUTTING YOUNG KIDS IN SCHOOL FOR THE FIRST TIME. AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY, WHEN I SENT MY KIDS TO SCHOOL, ARE THEY GOING TO BE OKAY. WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE THINGS THAT PARENTS HAVE ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT. THESE YOUNG PARENTS, I SEE IT WHEN I COACH BASEBALL, AND I TALKED TO THEM, THEY'RE SCARED TO DEATH ABOUT SPENDING THEIR YOUNG KIDS INTO SCHOOL. SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T EVEN THINK ABOUT. NONE OF US EVER THOUGHT ABOUT. IF REPUBLICANS CAN MOCK IT, IT'S THERE. IT'S REAL. AND IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE WITH SUBURBAN WOMEN.  PICKED UP MY DAUGHTER TWO DAYS AGO, HOW WAS YOUR DAY. DITESTLL WE HAD OUR LOCK DOWN DRILL TODAY, WE GOT IN A CLOSET AND LOCKED THE DOOR AND STOOD THERE IN THE DARK. TO Y OURPOINT, THIS IS ROUTINE TO THEM. YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, CLAIRE, AND I THINK THE REACTION FROM A LOT OF REPUBLICANS TO UVALDE, THEIR RESPONSE WAS PUT MORE ARMED PEOPLE IN SCHOOLS.  MORE GUNS.  WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE.  REPUBLICANS, MORE GUNS, SUBURBAN WOMEN, ARE YOU CRAZY.  I DON'T WANT TO WORRY ABOUT MY CHILD BEING SHOT IN SCHOOL.  I THINK THE INSENSITIVITY OF IT THAT ALSO MAKES PEOPLE UPSET IS THAT THEY'RE SAYING WE DON'T CARE, GIVE US MORE GUNS. AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING, DON'T YOU HEAR ME. WE DON'T NEED THAT.  WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION WHEN WE COME RIGHT BACK WITH NEW YORK CITY MAYOR, ERIC ADAMS. Y MAYOR, ERIC ADAMS 20221110125034.063|20221110125213.879",

        "trs": "> WITH US NOW THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY, ERIC ADAMS. HOW ARE YOU DOING?  QUITE WELL. QUITE WELL. GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL THIS MORNING. HAVE YOU CALLED THE GOVERNOR AND CONGRATULATED HER? WE SPOKE LAST NIGHT. WE COMMUNICATED. HAPPY FOR HER.  WILL SHE HELP YOU ON CRIME?  SHE'S BEEN A REAL PARTNER AROUND THESE ISSUES AROUND PUBLIC SAFETY, AND I'M JUST HAPPY ABOUT HER RETURNING TO ALBANY AND PUSHING THE AGENDA FORWARD.  IS SHE GOING TO HELP YOU AND HELP CRIME IN NEW YORK CITY?  YES. WITHOUT A DOUBT. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THIS ON THE AIR AND IT'S SO INTERESTING THAT WE TALK ABOUT CRIME IN PHILADELPHIA WHERE THE FOCUS GROUP, I HAD FOUR BLACK VOTERS SAYING I'M AFRAID TO GO TO WORK AND GO HOME. IF YOU LOOK AT MURDERS, PEOPLE ARE GETTING SLAUGHTERED AND YOU'RE SITTING THERE GOING, WHAT WORLD DO YOU LIVE IN? SO WHAT I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO TELL ME, I UNDERSTAND DATA GOING DOWN EXCEPT FOR MURDERS, EXPLAIN TO ME WHY PEOPLE WHO ARE CHEERING FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WANT DEMOCRATS TO WIN ARE FRIGHTENED BY MAGA REPUBLICANISM, THEY'RE WALKING AROUND THE CITY AND THEY DON'T FEEL AS SAFE AS THEY DID FIVE YEARS AGO, SIX YEARS AGO? WHY IS THERE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT EVERYBODY I TALK TO IS SAYING AND PEOPLE WHO LOVE NEW YORK AND SOME POLITICIANS WHO ARE SAYING, NO, NO, NO. IT'S JUST YOUR IMAGINATION. EVERYTHING'S OKAY.  WE HAVE TO NOT TALK AT PEOPLE, BUT TALK WITH PEOPLE, AND I'M ON THE SUBWAY SYSTEM EVERY DAY, JUST ABOUT. I WALK DOWN, AND I WANT TO SEE THE SUBWAY SYSTEM AND I'M ENGAGING WITH PEOPLE ONE-ON-ONE. OUR CONVERSATION CANNOT BE I'M GOING TO DICTATE TO YOU HOW YOU FELL. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU HOW YOU FEEL, AND I NEED TO GOVERN TO THAT. I BELIEVE THAT'S WHERE THE PROBLEM IS. WE HAVE A DOUBLE-DIGIT DECREASE IN HOMICIDE AND SOMETHING THEY WANTED TO FOCUS ON.  SINCE WHEN?  FROM JANUARY. OKAY. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO A MOTHER WHO LOST A LOVED ONE TO GUN VIOLENCE AND SOMEONE CARRIED A GUN INSIDE THE CLASSROOM, AND THE GOAL IS TO SPEAK DIRECTLY TO VOTERS AND FIND OUT WHAT ARE YOU FEELING AND I MUST DEAL WITH THE ACTUAL AND HOW YOU FEEL. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT. A LOT OF LEADERS SAY IT DOESN'T MATCH UP WITH DATA. I'M WONDERING, IS IT POST-COVID. I'M WONDERING ARE THERE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS THAT USED TO BE TAKEN CARE OF, PRE-COVID AND THERE USED TO BE MORE OF A SAFETY NET THERE? IS THAT WHAT COULD BE MAKING PEOPLE FEEL LESS COMFORTABLE? IT'S NOT THAT OH, THIS PERSON THAT -- NO, THEY'RE WALKING DOWN THE STREET AND SOMEONE COMES AND SCREAMS AT THEM AND PUSHES THEM DOWN.  WE NEVER TOOK CARE OF HOMELESS AND THIS IS A GENERATIONAL PROBLEM AND WHEN I WENT INTO THE SUBWAY SYSTEM THAT WE WILL NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO LIVE IN AN UNDIGNIFIED WAY, AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE PEOPLE OUT OF THE SUBWAY SYSTEM INTO SOME TYPE OF HOUSING. VERY QUICKLY, CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ANYBODY HOW ALLOWING PEOPLE TO HAVE MENTAL CHALLENGES TO BE HOMELESS ON THE STREET AS WINTER APPROACHES IS NOT HUMANITARIAN? IT'S NOT SAFE FOR THEM. IT'S NOT SAFE FOR NEW YORKERS. NOT SAFE FOR ANYBODY AND SOME PROGRESSIVES THINK THAT'S BEING INHUMANE TO ACTUALLY TAKE PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS WHEN THEY SLEEP ON GRATES IN THE WINTER.  IT'S INHUMANE. JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, THE FIRST MONTH I WENT OUT AND WENT INTO THOSE CAMPS AND HUMAN WASTE, DRUG PARAPHERNALIA, SOME PEOPLE DEALING WITH BIPOLAR. I MADE IT CLEAR TO THE TEAM WHEN I FINISHED THOSE WEEKS OF VISITING THOSE CAMPS THAT WE WILL NOT CONTINUE WITH THIS POLICY WALKING PAST PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING ON OUR STREETS AND THAT IS INHUMANE AND THE LOUDEST IS NOT GOING TO GET IN THE WAY OF WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IN MAKING SURE PEOPLE GET THE CARE THEY DESERVE. HOW ABOUT PROPER TREATMENT? YOU SEE THE CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT ARE WITH THE RICHEST ON WALL STREET, AND THEY'RE HELPING IN THE BRONX AND THE FIVE BOROUGHS. I'M JUST CURIOUS, HOW DO WE GET PEOPLE ENGAGED TO HELP THE TRULY DISADVANTAGED THAT ARE ON THE STREETS, THAT NEED TO GET OFF OF THE STREETS AND NEED TO GET TREATMENT.  LET ME TELL YOU HOW. WE ASK THEM. OUR CORPORATE LEADERS IN THE CITY WERE WAITING JUST TO BE INVITEDED IN. KATHY WILD AND THE PARTNERSHIP THEY RAISED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO SPECIFICALLY DEAL WITH HOW TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS. THEY HAVE BEEN A REAL PARTNER. WE HAVE 2% OF OUR INCOME, 51% OF OUR INCOME TAXES PAID BY 2% OF NEW YORKERS AND INSTEAD OF TRYING TO RUN THEM OUT OF THE CITY, THEY SHOULD BE PART OF OUR FINANCIAL ECOSYSTEM AND THEY HAVE STEPPED UP MAINLY BECAUSE WE WENT INTO OUR CORPORATE SUITES AND OFFICES AND ENGAGED IN THE CONVERSATION AND SAID THIS IS OUR CITY AND THEY SAID, ERIC, THEY HAVE BEEN WAITING TO GET OUT AND TALK TO THEM. IF YOU RAN THEM OUT OF THE CITY, THEY HAVE THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU WANT TO THE DO AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO RAISE WITH YOU. CLEARLY, THERE IS A FEELING AND JOE AND MIKA AND I TALK ABOUT IT ALL OF THE TIME IS THE FEELING OF BEING UNSAFE.  YES.  FOR SOME TO COME BACK WITH THE DATA, WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE FEELING UNSAFE, THAT HAVE REAL-LIFE EXPERIENCES, FEAR ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN THAT HAVE HAD REAL-LIFE EXPERIENCES, THE DATA DOESN'T MATTER AND YOU'VE COME OUT SAYING THAT, STRONGLY. YOU RAN ON THAT WHEN IT WASN'T POPULAR IN SOME ASPECTS OF A CERTAIN COMMUNITY AND YOU WON. IS IT NOT DETRIMENTAL TO YOU, AND I KNOW YOU'VE HELPED GET SOME PEOPLE IN THAT WERE NOT WILLING TO GO WHEN YOU WENT, BUT ISN'T IT DETRIMENTAL TO YOU FOR A LOT OF OFFICIALS AND NATIONALLY DEMOCRATS THIS WON'T DO WHAT YOU DID, AND WAIT A NOT, WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE REALITY THAT WHETHER THE DATA SAYS IT OR NOT, PERCEIVED UNSAFETY IS REAL TO THESE PEOPLE.  WITHOUT A DOUBT. I USE THE ACRONYM I.C.E., INFLATION, CRIME ECONOMY. THAT'S IT. AND NO MATTER HOW PEOPLE FEEL, IF YOU DON'T RESPOND TO THAT FEELING THEN YOU ARE ABANDONING EXACTLY WHAT'S NEEDED AND DEMOCRATS HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO PUBLIC SAFETY. THEY'RE AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT IT. IF YOU TALK ABOUT POLICE THAN GOOD, STRONG GUN LAWS AND IF YOU TALK ABOUT GOING AFTER THOSE SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE COMMITTING CRIME, THEY ARE AFRAID TO ARTICULATE THAT, BUT EVERYDAY NEW YORKERS PARTICULARLY IN THE CITY, THIS CATCH, RELEASE, IS LOSING THE FOUNDATION IN THE COUNTRY, AND SIX OUT OF TEN NEW YORKERS IN THE HISPANIC AND ASIAN COMMUNITY ARE WITH EIGHT OUT OF TEN THE LAST TIME. WE'RE LOSING THE BASE OF BLACK AND BROWN WHO REALLY BELIEVE IN THOSE BASIC THINGS, PUBLIC SAFETY, HOUSING HAD, EDUCATION. WE CANNOT TALK OUR WAY OUT OF THIS. WE HAVE TO BE REAL WITH PEOPLE WHAT'S FACING ON THE STREET.  A BIG PART OF THE REASON YOU'RE SITTING HERE RIGHT NOW AS MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY. I'M NOT TELLING YOU WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW. A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS CASH BAIL AND THAT HAS TO BE REFORMED. THAT'S A NEW ISSUE FOR YOU. NOT A GNAW ISSUE, BUT YOU'LL RE-ENGAGE WITH GOVERNOR HOCHUL, AND THE POLICE OFFICERS ARE VERY FRUSTRATED. THEY ARREST SOMEBODY. THEY SEE THEM BACK DOWN IN THE SUBWAY COMMITTING A CRIME THE NEXT DAY OR TWO DAYS LATER. HOW DO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE IN JAIL STAY IN JAIL? WHAT I MUST APPRECIATE OUR POLICE OFFICERS. OUT OF THEIR FRUSTRATION, THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO DO THEIR JOBS. A 27-YEAR HIGH AND FELONY ARRESTS, OVER 6,000 GUNS REMOVED OFF OUR STREETS AND THEY'RE IN THE SUBWAY SYSTEM WITH OVER 750,000 INSPECTIONS AND INJECTIONS DOING THEIR ON. NOW WE MUST RETURN TO ALBANY. IF WE SCHAFRM THE SMALL NUMBER OF OFFENDERS THAT I ADVOCATE FOR. MUCH OF THESE REFORMS I FOUGHT FOR, BUT TO NOT RECALIBRATE IS A BIG MISTAKE BECAUSE THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE, A SMALL NUMBER, I SHOULD SAY THAT ARE REPEAT OFFENDERS AND THEY'VE MADE UP THEIR MINDS AND WILL BE VIOLENT IN OUR STREETS AND THE UNPREDICTABLENESS OF THEIR BEHAVIOR.  WHEN YOU WERE IN THE STATE SENATE, THOSE OF US WHO ARE OUT OF GOVERNMENT WITH ADVOCACY GROUPS AND WHAT YOU DID, BUT THEY'LL BECOME A DEFORMED MOVEMENT WHERE THEY ARE ACTUALLY PUTTING THE VICTIMS THAT THEY CLAIM TO SPEAK FOR IN A MORE DANGEROUS PLACE, AND I THINK THAT WHAT I WAS SAYING BEFORE, WE HAVE TO STEP BACK UP AND TAKE THESE PEOPLE ON.  YES.  FIRST OF ALL, WE'RE NOT AFRAID OF THEM AND SECOND OF ALL THEY HAVE NO REAL FOLLOWING, THEY ARE DRIVING MORE PEOPLE AWAY THAN THEY'RE BRINGING IN.  THAT'S RIGHT.  WE CAN'T CONTINUE TO BELIEVE TWEETS.  AMEN.  ABOUT THE CHAOS THAT'S HAPPENING ON THE STREETS. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, LOOK AT EVERY BILL AND LAW WE'VE PASSED. ALL OF THESE BILLS AND LAWS YOU'RE SEEING ARE PROTECTING THOSE WHO COMMIT CRIMES. WHO'S GOING TO PASS LEGISLATION TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE THE VICTIMS OF CRIMES? SOMEONE IS A VICTIM OF A HOMICIDE OR YOU'RE THE PRIMARY BREADWINNER, WHY AREN'T WE PAYING THE RENT OR MORTGAGE UNTIL THAT FAMILY IS STABILIZED AND FOCUS THE PERSON WHO COMMIT THE CRIME, AND THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE MAKE LIFE BETTER FOR THEM AND WE HAVE TO FOCUS THE VICTIMS OF CRIMES AND NOT ON THOSE WHO COMMIT THE REPEATED CRIMES.  WILL GOVERNOR HOCHUL MOVE ON NO-CASH BAIL?  BELIEVE SHE WAS ALREADY THERE, IN MY OPINION. SHE UNDERSTOOD THE SIGNIFICANCE OF TWEAKING THE SYSTEM.  AGAIN, WE DON'T HAVE TO DO AWAY WITH THE REFORMS. THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WAS IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, BUT WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THOSE REPEATED OFFENDERS, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO USE GUNS, AND I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS LEGISLATIVE CYCLE AND NOW ELECTED AS THE FIRST WOMAN GOVERNOR OF THE STATE.  SO ONE FINAL QUESTION. WE'VE GOT A GOOD FRIEND OF THE SHOW THAT ALWAYS DRIVES AROUND WITH COPS IN THE CIA AND SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN A LOT OF BAD PLACES AROUND THE WORLD, SAYS HE'S FAR MORE FEARFUL FOR HIS LIFE, DRIVING AROUND WITH COPS IN PHILADELPHIA, THAN HE WAS IN AFGHANISTAN AND A LOT OF OTHER PLACES. PHILLY COPS ARE DOWN 600 COPS NOW. THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THE D.A. THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THE MAYOR. THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE ANYBODY HAS THEIR BACK. DO NEW YORK CITY COPS FEEL LIKE YOU'VE GOT THEIR BACK? DO THEY FEEL LIKE THE POLITICIANS HAVE GOT THEIR BACK? THAT THEY CAN DO THE JOB AND YES, YES, IF THEY STEP OUT OF LINE, IF THEY ABUSE THEIR POWER THEY NEED TO BE TREATED HARSHLY. WE ALL AGREE WITH THAT, WOO HAVE THAT AND I SAID IT, NOBODY ELSE HAS TO. BOTTOM LINE, DOES THE NEW YORK CITY COP FEEL LIKE THE POLITICIANS IN NEW YORK HAVE THEIR BACKS?  NO, THEY DON'T, FOR THE MOST PART, BUT THEY KNOW THE MAYOR. HE HAS THEIR BACK. I'M NOT LEADING THIS FIGHT OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND PUBLIC SAFETY FROM THE REAR. I'M LEADING IT FROM THE FRONT. I'M IN THE SUBWAY SYSTEM. I'M ENGAGING WITH MY POLICE OFFICERS AND I'M GOING TO THE CRIME SCENES AND DOING THE ANALYSIS. I'M LOOKING AT THE PRODUCT THAT WE ARE PRODUCING AND MAKING SURE THEY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED. THIS IS A TIME FOR US TO GO BACK TO WORKING PEOPLE AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE GIVING THEM THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT THEY DESERVE AND THAT IS WHERE I AM. LISTEN, I RAN AS A BLUE COLLAR MAYOR. I BELIEVE IN BLUE COLLAR VALUES AND THE WORKING-CLASS PEOPLE OF THIS CITY AND STATE, AND I WILL CONTINUE TO STAY CLOSE.  WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO COPS FEEL LIKE NO CITY OFFICIALS HAVE THEIR BACK.  MAKING SURE THEY HAVE THE TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT THAT THEY DESERVE AND DON'T IMMEDIATELY ATTACK THEM BASED ON WHAT YOU VIEW ON INSTAGRAM AND SOCIAL MEDIA BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE REALITY OF WHAT'S PLAYING OUT IN THE STREET.  THAT'S USUALLY NOT CONTEXT.  I WAS GOING TO SAY, EVERYBODY HAVING A CAMERA, THAT HAS CHANGED THE COMPLETION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE SOMEBODY CAN TAKE THE END OF AN ALTERCATION.  I'M NOT SAYING THERE AREN'T BAD COPS OUT THERE, THERE ARE.  SOMEONE ABUSED A COP FOR TEN MINUTES AND YELLS AT A COP, PUSHES A COP, THE COP RESPONDS THE WAY SHE'S BEEN TRAINED TO RESPOND OR SHE'S BEEN TRAINED AND THEY ONLY GET THAT PART.  SOMETIMES THEY RESPOND WRONG AND THEY SHOULD BE IN TROUBLE FOR THAT, AND I'M NOT ADVOCATING THAT ROGUE COPS ARE ABUSING PEOPLE. PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE VISUALS THEY'RE BEING FED THAT ARE DRIVING THESE FEELINGS THAT THEY USUALLY DON'T HAVE CONTEXT. AND TELLING POLICE OFFICERS, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT PART AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL THE FACTS ARE IN CONTEXT MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE.  AND THAT'S THE UNIQUENESS OF MY ROLE AS THE MAYOR. DID I THAT JOB. I KNOW WHAT IT IS TO SEE THE TAIL END OF THAT RESPONSE AND NOT THE COMPLETE RESPONSE AND THAT IS HOW WE ARE APPROACHING THIS, AND THE NUMBER OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT ON THAT UNIFORM AND RUN TOWARDS GUN FIRE AND NOT AWAY FROM IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE COMMENDED AND WE SHOULD BE PLEASED THAT WE HAVE THEM DOING THE JOB.  WE NEED THEM.  THAT'S THE PREREQUISITE TO PUBLIC SAFETY, WE NEED THEM BOTH.  ERIC ADAMS, THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING IN. THANK YOU.  WE HAVE CROSSED INTO THE TOP OF THE HOUR AND THIS MORNING THERE STILL IS NO DECISION ON WHICH PARTY WILL CONTROL THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. NBC NEWS PROJECTS DEMOCRATS -- EXCUSE ME, REPUBLICANS WILL WIN 222 SEATS, DEMOCRATS 213. THAT'S WITH A MARGIN OF ERROR OF SEVEN SO IT COULD SWING EITHER WAY. REPUBLICANS OF 49 AND GEORGIA HEADED TO A RUNOFF AFTER THE LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE DENIED RAPHAEL WARNOCK AND HIS REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER, HERSCHEL WALKER AND THE 50% THRESHOLD NEEDED TO WIN. ARIZONA STILL TOO EARLY TO CALL, AND KELLY LEADS MASTERS 51.4% WITH 46.4% WITH ONLY 47% OF THE VOTE IN. ADAM LAXALT CURRENTLY LEADS DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT KATHERINE CORTEZ MAST ONTO 47.6% WITH 84% OF THE VOTE IN DESPITE TUESDAY'S UNDERWHELMING RESULTS FOR CANDIDATES HE ENDORSED. FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP HAS NO PLANS TO PUSH BACK WHAT HE CALLED A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT. TRUMP PRESENTED A DIFFERENT VERSION OF TUESDAY'S EVENT, CLAIMING, QUOTE, TREMENDOUS SUCCESS. HE TRIED TO TAKE CREDIT FOR A SERIES OF WINS BY REPUBLICANS WHO HELD SEATS BEFORE HE EVEN ENTERED POLITICS INCLUDING MARCO RUBIO, RON JOHNSON AND CHUCK GRASSLEY. TRUMP WEIGHED IN ON THE RESULTS ON HIS TRUTH SOCIAL WEBSITE. ON ONE POST HE CLAIMED THE NEW HAMPSHIRE NOMINEE LOST HIS RACE FOR NOT STAYING STRONG AND TRUE ABOUT THE BIG LIE. IN ANOTHER HE COMPARED THE NUMBER OF VOTES HE RECEIVED IN 2020 TO THE SUPPORT THIS YEAR FOR A POSSIBLE OPPONENT.  THESE ARE ALL VERY WEAK.  FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS WHO HAS REALLY GOTTEN UNDER TRUMP'S SKIN. ADDED FROM HIS PERSONAL STANDPOINT IT WAS A BIG VICTORY AND AFTER ALL THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS TO HIM. ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES, MAGGIE HABERMAN WHO KNOWS TRUMP VERY WELL. HE IS FURIOUS ESPECIALLY ABOUT MEHMET OZ. TRUMP IS BLAMING EVERYONE ADVISED HIM TO BACK OZ INCLUDING GET THIS, HIS WIFE, DESCRIBING IT AS NOT HER BEST DECISION. THAT'S ACCORDING TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT. HE'S BLAMED SEAN HANNITY. HE'S BLAMING HIS WIFE.  I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S BLAMING --  ALL CLASS. HE'S BLAMING EVERYBODY.  BLAMING MELANIA. NOT A SMART MOVE.  I WOULDN'T DO THAT.  SOME REPUBLICANS ARE BLAMING TRUMP FOR THEIR LACKLUSTER ELECTION NIGHT INCLUDING ONE OF HIS ALLIES. LONG TIME TRUMP ADVISER DAVID IRPIN, REPUBLICANS HAVE FOLLOWED DONALD TRUMP OFF THE SIDE OF A CLIFF. TRUMP SHOULD NOT ANNOUNCE HIS RUN FOR RE-ELECTION NEXT WEEK AS EXPECTED. HE SHOULD WAIT AFTER THE GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFF IN DECEMBER. SHE ALSO WAS CLEAR WHO SHOULD AND WHO SHOULD NOT CAMPAIGN IN GEORGIA OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.  DO YOU SEE THE FORMER PRESIDENT, A NEED FOR HIM TO GO TO GEORGIA?  I THINK WE'VE GOT TO MAKE STRATEGIC CALCULATIONS. I THINK GOVERNOR DESANTIS SHOULD BE WELCOME TO THE STATE GIVEN WHAT HAPPENED. YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE REAL IS ON THE GROUND AND WE'VE GOT TO WIN THE SENATE. THAT'S IT, GUYS. GOT TO WIN THE SENATE.  I DON'T KNOW WHO IS ADVISING THE FORMER PRESIDENT TO MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN NEXT WEEK. THEY SHOULD ALL BE FIRED. NOBODY WANTS TO THINK ABOUT POLITICS RIGHT NOW RIGHT AFTER THE ELECTION. THE ONLY THING PEOPLE WILL BE FOCUSING ON AS YOU KNOW ARE THERE LAWSUITS IN ARIZONA AND THE RUNOFF ELECTION IN ARIZONA. THESE ARE IMPACTFUL THINGS THAT WILL AFFECT STUFF OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS THAT EVERYONE WILL BE PAYING ATTENTION TO. NOBODY WILL BE SURPRISED BY THIS ANNOUNCEMENT AND IT WILL NOT CLEAR THE FIELD AND AFTER THE ANNOUNCEMENT YESTERDAY EVERYONE WILL SAY, YEP, WHAT ELSE IS NEW AND GO TO THE NEXT PAGE AND THE NEXT STORY. I THINK IT'S A HORRIBLE IDEA AND HORRIBLE TIMING.  THAT WAS THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF NEW HAMPSHIRE CHRIS SUNUNU NOT HOLDING BACK. IN THE 36 HOUSE RACES THAT WERE RATED AS TOSS-UPS. TRUMP ENDORSED JUST FIVE REPUBLICANS EACH OF WHOM LOST HIS OR HER RACE AND HERE IS CHRIS CHRISTY.  ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THE COMPETITORS HAVE LOST AND IT'S A HUGE LOSS FOR TRUMP AND AGAIN T SHOWS THAT HIS POLITICAL INSTINCTS ARE NOT ABOUT THE PARTY. THEY'RE NOT ABOUT THE COUNTRY. THEY'RE ABOUT HIM.  CONSERVATIVE LEANING MEDIA OUTLETS ARE TURNING ON TRUMP. THIS EDITORIAL FROM \"THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER,\" VOTERS SAY THEY WANT SANITY AND DON'T WANT TRUMP. FROM \"THE NATIONAL REVIEW,\" DONALD TRUMP'S GOP ESTABLISHMENT HAS FAILED.  AND TRUMPTY, DUMPTY. HE DISCUSSES HOW HE WRITES, QUOTE SABOTAGED THE REPUBLICAN S. HEY, LYIN' TED AND SLEEPY JOE, MEET TOXICS TRUMP. HE MIGHT CONSIDER GIVING HIMSELF THIS ILLITERATIVE NICKNAME AFTER THREE NATIONAL TALLIES EITHER IN WHICH HE OR HIS PARTY OR BOTH AND IT'S TIME FOR HIS STANDS TO ACCEPT THE TRUTH. HE'S THE TOXIC EQUIVALENT OF A CAN OF RAID. IT WAS THE MOST PROFOUND VOTE REPELLENT IN MODERN AMERICAN HISTORY UPON. THE SUREST WAY TO LOSE IN THE MIDTERMS IS TO BE A POLITICIAN ENDORSED BY TRUMP. THAT'S THE FRONT PAGE OF \"THE NEW YORK POST\" JOE, THE WALL STREET JORNAL EDITORIAL PAGE AND TRUMP IS THE GOP'S BIGGEST LOSER ON THE FLIP SIDE OF THE EDITORIAL PAGE AND A RINGING ENDORSEMENT OF RON DESANTIS AND HIS POTENTIAL TO RUN.  TWO MORE YEARS OF RON DESANTIS. AGAIN, THE WHITE SMOKE RISING OVER FOX NEWS, RISING OVER NEWSCORP AND THEY'RE LOOKING NOW AT EITHER CARDINAL DESANTIS OR CARDINAL YOUNGKIN AS THEIR NEXT.  HERE IS SOME OF WHAT WE HEARD LAST NIGHT ON FOX NEWS.  GOING INTO 2024 THE REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR CANDIDATES WHO ARE FOCUSED ON WINNING, NOT JUST MAKING A POINT OR SETTLING A SCORE. THE POPULIST MOVEMENT IS ABOUT IDEAS. IT IS NOT ABOUT ANY ONE PERSON. IF THE VOTERS CONCLUDE THAT YOU'RE PUTTING YOUR OWN EGO OR YOUR OWN GRUDGES AHEAD OF WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK ELSEWHERE. PERIOD.  McCONNELL SPENT CLOSES TO $400 MILLION ON THESE SENATE CANDIDATES. I DON'T KNOW WHAT GOES ON BEHIND THE SCENE, BUT THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY AND WE DIDN'T PICK UP A SINGLE SEAT? SO EITHER SOME OF THESE CANDIDATES ARE GARBAGE OR THE MONEY IS NOT BEING WELL SPENT, BUT TRUMP SITTING ON A MASSIVE WAR CHEST IN MAR-A-LAGO. WHERE DID THAT MONEY GO?  THAT'S A QUESTION, WILLIE. FIRST OF ALL, YEAH, THE CANDIDATES WERE SOME OF THE WORST WE'VE EVER SEEN AND DONALD TRUMP, AGAIN, HE RAISED ALL OF THE MONEY FOR STOP THE STEAL AND HE DIDN'T SPEND THAT MONEY BECAUSE TRUMP DOESN'T SPEND HIS MONEY.  NO. HE BUILDS HIS SUPPORTERS FROM MONEY AROUND JANUARY 6th AND WE'LL SET UP THE BIG FUND AND THEN STOP THE STEAL. WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?  HE HAS TRAINED NOW REPUBLICANS NOT TO VOTE IN THE EASIEST AND MORE CONVENIENCE WAY. NO MORE MAIL-IN BALLOTS AND NO MORE EARLY VOTING AND THAT USED TO BE WHERE THEY WOULD KILL US AND THEY USED TO GET THE ABSENTEES AND THERE WERE ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO LIKED THE MAIL-IN BALLOTS AND THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE DISCOURAGING YOUR SUPPORTERS FROM VOTING IN THE EASIEST, MOST SECURE AND EFFECTIVE WAY IS CRAZY TOWN AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY GET THAT BACK BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE CONVINCEDED THAT IF THEY MAIL IN A BALLOT THEY'RE NOT AN AMERICAN.  THAT'S HOW I RAN YOU HAVE MASSIVE TALLIES BY JUST OBSESSING -- OBSESSING OVER ABSENTEE --  REPUBLICANS WERE REALLY GOOD AT MAIL-IN BALLOTS. NOT ANYMORE.  THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DCCC, DEMOCRAT SEAN PATRICK MALONEY OF NEW YORK, I WOULD SAY, DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE TRUE AT ONE TIME, THE CHAIRMAN HAD A GREAT NIGHT AND IN FACT, A HISTORIC NIGHT. YOU CAN GO BACK AND LOOK AT MIDTERMS GOING ALL OF THE WAY BACK TO JFK AND NOBODY HAD AS GREAT A NIGHT IN AN OFF YEAR ELECTION WHEN DEMOCRATS WERE IN POWER AND THE OTHER SIDE OF IT WHERE YOU LOST YOUR RACE, BUT I'M WONDERING IF YOU'RE THINKING WHEN I HEARD THE NEWS THAT YOU ACTUAL LIE, YOU GOT REPUBLICANS TO TRAIN SO MUCH FIRE ON YOU, AS FAR AS POLITICAL FIRE. 6 MILLION, 7 MILLION, $8 MILLION TO TAKE YOU, ONE PERSON OUT. MORE $10 MILLION. WHATEVER IT WAS. IF THEY HADN'T SPENT THAT MONEY ON YOU. THEY WOULD HAVE SPENT IT ON TEN OTHER CANDIDATES AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MUCH BETTER NIGHT. ACTUALLY, YOU HELPED YOUR CAUCUS IN A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS.  THAT'S GENEROUS, BUT I WILL ACCEPT THE KIND WORDS ON BEHALF OF THE CANDIDATES WHO WORKED THEIR HEART OUT, BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS FOR TWO YEARS, AND IF WE DID BETTER THAN ANYBODY EXPECTED IT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE A GOOD PRESIDENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND A ROCK STAR IN THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE WHO DELIVERED AN ECONOMIC AGENDA AND A DEMOCRACY AGENDA THAT HAS REALLY MOVED OUR COUNTRY BACK FROM THE MADNESS AND INSANITY IN THE PANDEMIC AND THE TRUMP YEARS.  I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A PICTURE OF YOU AND NANCY AND NANCY REACHED OUT TO YOU AND THANKED YOU FOR TAKING AN ARROW FOR DEMOCRATS AND FOR DEFENDING THEM THE WAY YOU DID AND HELPING THEM HAVE SUCH A GREAT NIGHT.  BEFORE YOU CARVE ME IN MARBLE I LOST MY SEAT AND I WISH IT WAS UP BECAUSE RIGHT NOW NO ONE CAN TELL YOU FOR CERTAINTY WHAT HOLDS THE MAJORITY OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE. THE FACT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT SHOULD GIVE EVERYONE HUMILITY IN THE PRESS WHO WROTE US OFF FOR TWO YEARS AND I'M CONCERNED A BUNCH OF DEMOCRATS MIGHT HAVE LISTENED TO YOU BECAUSE THE FACT IS WE WERE ALWAYS GOING TO BE COMPETITIVE BECAUSE WE HAD SUCH GREAT CANDIDATES AND LEADERSHIP IN THE SPEAKER AND IN THE PRESIDENT, AND I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW, YEAH, I AGREE WITH YOUR PROJECTION, IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE LOW, AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT WE STARTED WITH 220 IN THEIR SEATS, A COUPLE OF VACANCIES AND 30 PEOPLE WALKING OUT THE DOOR.  YEAH. AND SO ABOUT 185 WANTING TO IN BACK. THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING IT, AND I THINK, YEAH, YOU LOSE THREE TO FIVE AND IT'S JUST OUT OF REDISTRICTING. SO IF YOU GO FROM LOW 180s TO 215 WITH THE HEADWINDS WE HAD, LET ME JUST, I WANT PEOPLE TO BE CLEAR. THIS WASN'T SOME HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT BLEW THE CLOUDS OF THE MAGA MOVEMENT AWAY AND OUR VOLUNTEERS AND OUR DONORS AND OUR CANDIDATES, MY GOODNESS AND I AM SO PROUD OF THAT EFFORT AND I WISH MORE PEOPLE HAD BELIEVEDED IN IT, AND I WISH MORE DEMOCRATS HAD STAYED AND I FEEL PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE THAT WE DIDN'T DELIVER THE MAJORITY. WE'RE GOING TO COME DARN CLOSE, BUT I ALWAYS BELIEVED IT WAS POSSIBLE AND THEY'RE STILL IN THEIR PATH AND I WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THIS IS A WORK DAY FOR ME AND FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE. WE ARE NOT DONE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ENDED THE ELECTION TUESDAY NIGHT AND WE ARE MAKING SURE EVERY LEGAL VOTE IS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND CARRYING ABSENTEE BALLOTS AND WE HAVE EASILY TWO DOZEN RACES WHERE IT'S THE REALLY MATTERS THAT WE WORK AT THIS AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM STEAL A SINGLE SEAT.  SO, CLAIRE, YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT SITUATION AND WE'RE NOT CARVING SEAN UP IN MARBLE, JUST SPEAKING THE TRUTH TO SAY THAT TUESDAY NIGHT WAS A HISTORIC NIGHT FOR A PARTY IN POWER, I'VE NEVER SEEN. DAVE HAS NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS, I HAVE NEVER SEEN A PARTY IN 2002 IN '98 THAT DID AS WELL AS THE DEMOCRATS DID WHEN THEY WERE IN POWER. WHEN THEY OWNED WASHINGTON. FIRST OF ALL, I'LL TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE IT'S GREAT OUT HERE. IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. I PROMISE YOU.  I CAN ASK YOU SOMETHING? I'VE HEARD THERE THEY THIS DAY BETWEEN FRIDAY AND MONDAY WHEN PEOPLE DON'T WORK. IT'S TRUE. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW HARD YOU'VE BEEN WORKING UNTIL YOU GET OUT IN THE REAL WORLD AND I FEEL GUILTY, I'M SO HAPPY. SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT IS THE FUND-RAISING PIECE AND HOW IT HAS CHANGED. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HAS LOOKED IN THE CAMERA AND THANKED THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT GAVE $5. THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THAT GAVE THEIR 10. OUR VIEWERSHIP IS FALL OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT FOUND A RACE, WHETHER IT WAS IN CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, NEW JERSEY, NEW YORK AND THEY GAVE A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY THEY COULD AFFORD. WE RAISED SO MUCH MORE MONEY, NOT FROM THE BACK ROOM DARK MONEY FOLKS, BUT FROM REAL PEOPLE. BY THE WAY, THAT MONEY ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, IT'S SITTING AT MAR-A-LAGO. THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WERE SO DISADVANTAGES BECAUSE THE GRASSROOTS GIVING WHICH HAS BECOME HUGE WITH THE INTERNET IS GOING TO DONALD TRUMP WHERE AS THE GRAT GRASSROOTS ON MY SIDE IS GOING TO THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES.  THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING THAT. I SHOULD PROBABLY MENTION WE'RE STILL RAISING MONEY AND WE CAN STILL HELP, AND YOUR $5 WOULD BE GREAT, BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ABOUT THAT AND OUR SMALL DONORS ARE GREAT. THANK YOU. I HAVE TO MENTION THAT THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP FUND, THE SUPER PAC, EIGHT PEOPLE GAVE OVER $70 MILLION TO THAT EFFORT. EIGHT PEOPLE AND SO THAT'S ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE, BY THE WAY, OF WHAT THEY RAISED AND WHAT WE DID ON THE OUTSIDE. WE BEAT THEM, HEAD TO HEAD VERSUS THE NRCC, BUT THAT ENORMOUS DARK MONEY ADVANTAGE LARGELY FUELED BY THE RICHEST PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY IS ONE PLACE WHERE THEY ABSOLUTELY HAD AN ADVANTAGE ON IT. THANK YOU FOR MENTIONING THAT THEY COULD HAVE WON TWO OR THREE SEATS, AND I THINK THERE WAS INEFFICIENCY AND THE CANDIDATE LEVEL AND THEY GET CHEAPER TV RATES AND SO OUR CANDIDATES AGAIN, AND OUR CANDIDATE INCLUDING THOSE WHO FELL SHORT. PEOPLE LIKE ELAINE LURIA AND TOM MALINOWSKI. THEY PUT THEIR HEART AND SOUL INTO THIS AND THOSE WERE THE HARDEST DISTRICTS IN THE COUNTRY. WE STARTED WINNING AT ANGIE CRAIG AND SUSAN WILDE IN PENNSYLVANIA. I MEAN, MATT CARTWRIGHT, DOUBLE TRUMP DISTRICT, THE GUY'S WINNING AND WITH ALL OF THE HEADWINDS AND ALL OF THE EXPECTATION SETTING AND I JUST WISH WE GOT TO TWO 18 AND I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT, BUT I THINK THAT WE CAN STAGE -- WE STOOD OUR GROUND, AND WE DID IT BECAUSE OUR PRESIDENT AND THE SPEAKER DELIVERED AN AGENDA TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN THE CONGRESS THAT TACKLED THE BIGGEST ISSUES IN OUR COUNTRY FROM CLIMATE CHANGE TO THE RACIAL CRISIS AND I DON'T WANT THE SUBSTANCE TO GET LOST IN THE POLITICAL CONVERSATION. WE'RE FIGHTING FOR SOMETHING AND WE'RE DELIVERING ON IT. WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO ON VOTING RIGHTS AND EVERYTHING THAT WE FELL SHORT ON, BUT DO THINK REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM, AND I DO THINK -- I DO THINK WHAT WE'RE STANDING FOR IS AT THE HEART OF OUR SUCCESS, IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT ON TUESDAY NIGHT.  BOY, WILLIE. I HAVE TO SAY. JOE BIDEN WAS MOCKED BY SO MANY PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT FOR TALKING ABOUT ABORTION IT JUST MADE A MASSIVE DIFFERENCE AND DEMOCRACY. PEOPLE WENT OUT AND VOTED ON THAT, WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSMENT OF YOUR RACE, BUT WHAT HAPPENED ACROSS NEW YORK STATE AND SHE HELD OFF LEE ZELDIN THERE AND THOSE RACES ON LONG ISLAND ALL WENT TO REPUBLICANS AND WHAT WAS GOING ON IN NEW YORK THIS CIRCLE.  HERE'S AS SIMPLE AS I CAN MAKE IT. NEW YORK WAS CLEARLY AN OUTLIER, WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST THAT CAME BACK AROUND AND THERE WERE PLACES WHERE WE WERE SLOGGING AND OTHER PLACES LIKE MICHIGAN AND NORTH CAROLINA, IT WAS AROUND NEW YORK CITY AND I WANT TO SAY THIS SO NOBODY HAS A MISUNDERSTANDING. UNDER ANY ITERATION OF THE MAP, THE TOP OF THE TICKET WOULD HAVE LOST THE SEATS ON LONG ISLAND BY DOUBLE DIGITS. THAT'S A PROBLEM. WHEN YOU'VE GOT OPEN SEATS AND THE RICE SEATS, YOU KNOW, DIDN'T CHANGE ON ANY ITERATION OF THE MAPS SO OUR CANDIDATES HAVE TO OUTPERFORM THE GOVERNOR BY MORE THAN TEN POINTS OFF OF MORE THAN 15 POINTS AND THAT'S A LOT TO ASK. AND BY THE WAY, WITHOUT A HANDFUL OF VOTERS IN NEW YORK 18, WE WOULD HAVE LOST IN ALL OF THE HUDSON VALLEY.  REALLY QUICKLY, PUT THIS BACK UP AGAIN, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE SAYING, YOU SAID HOCHUL WASN'T GOING TO WIN OR IT WAS GOING TO BE CLOSE AND SHE ENDED UP WINNING. SHE SHOULD HAVE WON BY 20 POINTS AND THE FACT SHE WON BY FIVE POINTS, SIX POINTS AND THE FACT SHE GOT ABSOLUTELY HAMMERED OUT ON LONG ISLAND MADE A DIFFERENCE --  LISTEN, I'M SAYING IT'S NOT YOU, I'M JUST SAYING IT MADE A DIFFERENCE AND THERE ARE FOUR LESS DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BECAUSE OF IT. THAT'S RIGHT. AND THAT'S A HARD THING TO SWALLOW AND THE FACT THAT MY SEAT'S ONE OF THEM BOTHERS ME BECAUSE THE MAJORITY COULD HAVE BEEN -- COULD HAVE BEEN WON AND IT WAS -- IT WAS OUR INABILITY TO SPEAK TO VOTERS IN SUBURBAN NEW YORK CITY AGAIN UNDER ANY ITERATION OF THE MAPS THAT -- THAT COULD HAVE MADE THE DIFFERENCE. NOW I THINK WE OWN THAT AS DEMOCRATS AND I'M NOT BLAMING THE GOVERNOR, BY THE WAY AND I'M NOT BLAMING YOUR LAST GUEST AND THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK IS THE SOLUTION AND HE'S TRYING TO CLEAN UP THE CITY AND GOOD, BUT -- BUT THAT'S JUST -- THAT'S JUST THE REALIST ANY FAIR ANALYSIS AND BLAME ME BECAUSE I SHOULD HAVE WON 3,000 MORE VOTES.  WE WON'T DO SO.  NO, I WOULD HAVE HAD TO OUTPERFORM THE TOP OF THE TICKET BY 12 POINTS AND THAT'S A TALL ORDER AND I WAS WALKING AND CHEWING GUM AT THE SAME TIME AND IT BUMS ME OUT.  NO --  WHAT IT SAYS TO ME IS WE ARE COMPETITIVE AS A NATIONAL PARTY AND I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE ENERGIZED BY THAT, TO STAND YOUR GROUND ON ALL OF THE THINGS FROM DEMOCRACY TO RACIAL JUSTICE AND WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK IN A BIG WAY IN '24.  WELL, I KNOW WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST OF YOU. WE'LL TALK TO YOU MUCH MORE AND WE HAVE MORE RACES STILL TO BE DECIDED AND THANK FOR SPENDING TIME WITH US THIS MORNING.  MR. CHAIRMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THANK YOU, GUYS. > THIS MORNING WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THE ELECTION RESULTS OUT OF MICHIGAN, AS WELL. THE STATE HAD RECORD BREAKING TURNOUT, 4.5 MILLION VOTERS CAST A BALLOT THERE ON TUESDAY. DEMOCRATS, A BIG NIGHT. THE GOVERNOR, ATTORNEY GENERAL, SECRETARY OF STATE, ALL WINNING ANOTHER TERM. DEMOCRATS ALSO TOOK CONTROL OF THE LEGISLATURE, HANDING THE PARTY FULL POWER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEARLY 40 YEARS. JOINING US NOW, MICHIGAN'S NEWLY RE-ELECTED SECRETARY OF STATE JOSLYN BENSON. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US TALK US TO, AND IF YOU CAN, MORE BROADLY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN. A BIG MARGIN FOR GOVERNOR WITMER IN A RACE THAT SOME DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT FOR A WHILE. WHAT HAPPENED ON TUESDAY IN MICHIGAN?  WELL, FIRST IT WAS, AS YOU MENTIONED, THE HIGHEST TURNOUT MIDTERM ELECTION AND THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT AND YOUNG VOTERS TURN OUT IN RECORD NUMBERS AND ALSO SIGNIFICANT AND WE MADE THESE ELECTIONS NOT ABOUT THESE VERSUS OURS, AND THE FREEDOM TO VOTE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF ELECTING DEMOCRACY AND THE IMPACT OF THEIR VOICE AND THEIR VOTES ON EVERY ISSUE INCLUDING THE ECONOMY AND BY MAKING IT THAT SIMPLE, TRUTH, LIES, DEMOCRACY OR NOT, FREEDOM OR NOT, WE WERE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL.  SECRETARY OF STATE, IT'S CLAIRE McCASKILL HERE. ONCE AGAIN CONGRATULATING YOU AND BY THE WAY, ALLOW ME THIS MOMENT. THERE WERE A LOT OF STRONG WOMEN ON THE STATEWIDE TICKET FOR MICHIGAN.  ACROSS THE BOARD.  I SAW ONE OF THE PICTURES YOU GUYS DID ONLINE WHERE THE THREE OF YOU LOOKED LIKE CHARLIE'S ANGELS, BUT LOTS OF HARD WORK AND INTEGRITY. I KNOW HOW STRONGLY YOU FEEL ABOUT PROFESSIONALISM AND ELECTIONS. THE COUNTY CLERKS AND THE LOCAL ELECTION BOARDS AND THE TRANSPARENCY AND TRAINING THAT WENT INTO THE EFFORT AND TALK ABOUT THOSE UNSUNG HEROES. WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT I KNOW YOU HAVE A LARGE CAST OF CHARACTERS THAT YOU WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE BECAUSE OF THE PHENOMENAL JOB THEY DID ON TUESDAY, KIND OF QUELLING THE NONSENSE THAT OUR ELECTIONS AREN'T FAIR.  THANK YOU, CLAIRE. WE'RE A TEAM, DEMOCRACY IS A TEAM SPORT FROM THE WOMEN AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET AND THE WE ARE TRULY SO MUCH BETTER TOGETHER, BUT THE 1500 CLERKS ALL ACROSS OUR STATE AND THOUSANDS OF POLL WORKERS WERE REALLY DETERMINED TO MAKE SURE THIS ELECTION WENT SMOOTHLY. I SHOW SIDE UP AT MY POLLING PLACE TO WORK AND WAS BLOWN AWAY HOW THE ENERGY WAS TO SAY NOT ON OUR WATCH, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US FROM POLL WORKERS TO ME IN THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE, WE WERE DETERMINED TO PROTECT THE VOTERS AND TO PROTECT THE SANCTITY OF THE ELECTION AND WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN DOING SO AND PUSHING BACK AGAINST THIS REALLY COORDINATED EFFORT TO UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY THAT DID NOT SUCCEED IN MICHIGAN IN 2020 AND IT DIDN'T SUCCEED IN '22.  ESPECIALLY IN MICHIGAN IN 2022. A REMARKABLE NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS IN MICHIGAN. MICHIGAN SECRETARY OF STATE, JOCELYNE, CONGRATULATIONS.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  SO WE'VE SORT OF BACK-TO-BACK SINCE THE MAYOR LEFT. I WAS TAKEN, DO THE COPS IN NEW YORK CITY FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, POLITICIANS -- POLITICIANS GOT THEIR BACK? HE SAID NO. NO, THEY DON'T. YOU AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS. THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFER THE MOST OR THE MOST DISADVANTAGED.  WELL, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WE DON'T TALK ABOUT ENOUGH IN NEW YORK IS NOW THE CLASS POLICEMEN ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ERIC ADAMS HIMSELF WAS ONE THAT WAS ENCOURAGED BY MANY OF THE MOVEMENT THAT WE WANTED TO PUT PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE DEPARTMENT.  RIGHT.  SO I THINK THAT WE'VE ALOUD SOME OF THE EXTREMISTS ON THE RIGHT TO ACT LIKE IT'S US AGAINST THEM WHEN, IN FACT, WE ARE THEM, AND I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TO STOP LETTING PEOPLE ACT LIKE THE BLACK, COMMUNITY OR THE BROWN COMMUNITY OR THE CRIMINALS AND THE OTHERS ARE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT. NO, WE ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT AND WE'VE GOT TO ALL FIGHT TOGETHER AGAINST CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR INCLUDING WHEN COPS ARE ON. I, THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FACT THAT NATIONALLY, KEITH EL SON WON WHO PROSECUTED THE CASE OF GEORGE FLOYD, BUT HE DID IT BECAUSE HE DID A METHODICAL INVESTIGATION, HE DIDN'T GO BY AS CLAIRE SAID THE END OF A TAPE BECAUSE AS SOMEONE THAT WORKS WITH THESE FAMILIES, THE WORST THING IN THE WORLD IS FOR YOU TO HAVE A SITUATION THAT CAN BE IN MANY WAYS UNRAVELED BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE THE WHOLE STORY OR THE REAL STORY BECAUSE YOU HURT THE CAUSE EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY NOT HAVE INTENDED TO. YOU'VE GOT TO SAY, AND I'VE BEEN OUT HERE LONG ENOUGH TO SAY, I'M GOING TO LOOK HOW DEEP IT IS BEFORE I JUMP IN THE WATER BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO JUMP IN ONE INCH AND BREAK MY FACE JUMPING IN, AND I THINK THAT THAT IS TO PROTECT THE MOVEMENT, NOT TO SLOW IT DOWN.  WELL SAID. REVEREND AL SHARPTON, THANK YOU. THE RADICAL COMMEYS, GREAT BAND OUT OF PORTLAND. CLAIRE McCASKILL, THANK YOU, AS WELL. WE APPRECIATE IT. STILL AHEAD ON \"MORNING JOE,\" STEVE KORNACKI BREAKS DOWN THE BIGGEST MIDTERM RACES THAT REMAIN UNCALLED AND WE'LL HEAD OUT TO THE BIG BOARD, PLUS REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN ADAM KINZINGER GIVES US HIS TAKEAWAYS FROM ELECTION NIGHT INCLUDING DONALD TRUMP'S IMPACT ON HIS PARTY AND WE WILL BE JOINED BY SENATOR CORY BOOKER OF NEW JERSEY. A BUSY MORNING STILL AHEAD. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK ON \"MORNING JOE.\" 20221110133507.083|20221110133920.003",

        "trs": "> THE PLAN ACCUSED OF VIOLENTLY ATTACKING HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI'S HUSBAND PAUL PELOSI HAS BEEN INDICTED BY A FEDERAL GRAND JURY ON ASSAULT AND KIDNAPPING CHARGES. IF CONVICTED, 42-YEAR-OLD DAVID DePAPE COULD FACE UP TO 30 YEARS IN PRISON FOR ASSAULT AND 20 YEARS FOR ATTEMPTED KIDNAPPING. DePAPE FACES A SERIES OF STATE CHARGES. HE HAS PLEADED NOT GUILTY TO ALL OF THEM. MEANWHILE, VIRGINIA GOVERNOR GLENN YOUNGKIN APOLOGIZED TO SPEAKER PELOSI FOR COMMENTS HE MADE HOURS AFTER THE ATTACK ON HER HUSBAND. GOVERNOR YOUNGKIN WAS AT A CAMPAIGN RALLY AT THE MORNING OF THE ATTACK SAID THERE'S NO ROOM FOR VIOLENCE ANYWHERE, BUT WE'RE GOING TO SEND HER BACK TO BE WITH HIM IN CALIFORNIA. TALKING ABOUT PAUL PELOSI. YESTERDAY, YOUNGKIN SAID HE SENT A PERSONAL HANDWRITTEN NOTE APOLOGIZING TO THE HOUSE SPEAKER.  THAT'S A GOOD THING. IT'S WHAT WE WANT.  A SECOND APOLOGY. HE SAID THE DAY AFTER THAT AFTER MAKING THAT TASTELESS AWFUL REMARK, I TRIED TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS, I DIDN'T DO A VERY GOOD JOB. THIS IS THE SECOND APOLOGY, HANDWRITTEN NOTE.  SPEAKING OF TASTELESS AND AWFUL, OTHER REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO MAKE JOKES ABOUT THAT BRUTAL ASSAULT, AGAIN, AN ATTACK WITH A HAMMER ON AN 82-YEAR-OLD MAN THAT FRACTURED HIS SKULL AND SENT HIM TO THE ICU IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. HERE'S WHAT ARIZONA CONGRESSMAN ANDY BIGS SAID ON TUESDAY NIGHT.  WE CAN'T WAIT TO GET BACK TO WASHINGTON, D.C. WITH SOME NEW ARIZONA CONGRESSMEN. AND WE'RE GOING TO SHOW NANCY PELOSI THE DOOR VERY SHORTLY. DON'T LET IT HIT YOU ON THE BACKSIDE, NANCY. YEAH, SHE'S LOSING THE GAVEL, BUT FINDING THE HAMMER. TOO SOON? IS THAT TOO SOON? I DIDN'T KNOW. I JUST DIDN'T KNOW.  WHO RAISED HIM. I WONDER WHAT HIS MOTHER OR FATHER WOULD THINK OF -- IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW OLD MY MOM OR DAD WERE, IF I'D SAID SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THANKSGIVING WOULD BE ROUGH, AND MY MOM WOULD SAY I'M ASHAMED OF YOU.  DOESN'T HE HAVE KIDS? HE GREW UP IN THE MORMON CHURCH. I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANYBODY IN THAT CHURCH WHO EVER TAUGHT HIM TO SPEAK OR THINK THAT WAY ABOUT ANOTHER PERSON. AGAIN, THIS INFECTION OF POLITICS. WITH THIS CONGRESSMAN, HE IS IN THAT MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE CAMP OF PEOPLE WHO SAY THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS THINGS THEY CAN SAY TO GET ATTENTION AND HAS VOTED AGAINST ALL KINDS OF THINGS. WE COULD GO DOWN THE LIST. WHERE DOES THIS -- YOU SIT THERE ON THE STAGE, MAYBE THAT JOKE IS BREWING IN YOUR MIND, THE DECISION TO MAKE IT COMES FROM WHERE? I THINK HE THINKS THERE'S SOME REWARD, THERE'S CHEERING IN THE ROOM, THE SAME CALCULATION THAT KARI LAKE MADE WHEN SHE MADE THE JOKE, IT'S GOING TO WORK IN THIS ROOM. IT WILL FIRE SOME PEOPLE UP. JUST DISGUSTING ON A HUMAN LEVEL.  I'VE BEEN IN THAT SITUATION, AND IT NEVER EVEN COMES INTO YOUR MIND.  IT SHOULDN'T.  THE FIRST THING YOU WOULD SAY IS, I DON'T CARE WHO IT IS. IF YOU BRING UP NANCY PELOSI, THE FIRST THING YOU SAY IS, FIRST OF ALL, LET'S -- BY THE WAY, WE'RE THINKING ABOUT PAUL PELOSI. AND WE'RE PRAYING FOR HIM. HE'S A GRANDFATHER. HE'S A HUSBAND. WE DON'T AGREE WITH NANCY ON EVERYTHING, BUT SHE'S A COLLEAGUE. JUST LIKE NANCY PELOSI DID WITH STEVE SCALISE. JUST LIKE WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE.  WE ARE ONE FAMILY.  AND STEVE SCALISE DID IN THIS CASE, RIGHT AWAY.  I HAD ASKED THE QUESTION, I HAD NOT SEEN THE TWEET. I'M GLAD YOU READ IT, BUT STEVE DID IN THIS CASE AS WELL. GOD BLESS HIM. WE'RE IN THIS, KATTY, TOGETHER. WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER. REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS, WE ARE AMERICANS. WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO WORK TOGETHER. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT COMES FROM, SOMEBODY SAYING SOMETHING LIKE THAT.  YOU'RE UP THERE, YOU'RE LOVING THE CROWD, I THINK THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED WITH KARI LAKE. SHE MADE THAT COMMENT AND IT WAS THE SMIRK, GENE SAID EARLIER, THERE'S THE SMIRK THAT GIVES PERMISSION TO THE AUDIENCE TO LAUGH AND SHE GETS THE ADDLATION OF A JOKE SHE'S MADE AND IT'S THAT FEELING OF WE ARE ALL OWNING THE LIBS TO GO, AND LOOK HOW OUTRAGEOUS WE CAN BE, AND LOOK HOW FAR WE CAN GO IN OWNING THE LIBS, AND WE DON'T CARE, THEY'RE GOING TO CRITICIZE US, BUT WE DON'T CARE. AS KARI LAKE SAID THE NEXT DAY, OH, I CAN'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING ANYMORE, IT'S LIKE A DELIBERATE ROLLOUT. YOU DO SOMETHING OFFENSIVE AND HIT BACK AT PEOPLE FOR CRITICIZING YOU FOR BEING OFFENSIVE IN A WAY THAT'S TOTALLY DISINGENUOUS, BECAUSE SHE STARTED REFERRING TO A WHOLE LOAD OF OTHER STUFF. I WAS WITH GLENN YOUNGKIN IN VIRGINIA. HE'S AN IMPRESSIVE CAMPAIGNER FOR THE REPUBLICANS. HE'S SOMEBODY WHO HAS MANAGED TO KEEP A KIND OF OPEN ARM TO EVERYBODY. HE HAS NOT TOTALLY DISSED TRUMP. HE DID SPEND TIME WITH KARI LAKE, IF HE'S TRYING TO BE A CENTRIST. I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT HE MADE THAT TIME TO SEND A HANDWRITTEN NOTE. TWO THINGS HAPPENED IN THE WEEK IN THE RUN UP TO THE MIDTERMS. ONE WAS THE PAUL PELOSI ATTACK AND THE REACTION FROM SOME OF THOSE EXTREMISTS TO THE PAUL PELOSI ATTACK AND THE OTHER WAS DONALD TRUMP BEING OUT AND MUCH MORE VISIBLE AND CALLING NANCY PELOSI AN ANIMAL, AND I THINK THOSE, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHETHER THOSE TWO THINGS IN THE RUN UP TO THE MIDTERMS, PEOPLE WENT INTO THE POLLS WITH THOSE RINGING IN THEIR HEADS AND THOUGHT, AS YOU SAID, JOE, THAT'S NOT HOW MY MOM RAISED ME, THAT'S NOT HOW MY PARENTS RAISED ME. IT'S JUST NOT NICE, AND YOU WONDER HOW MANY VOTES THAT SWAYED.  IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE HOW MANY VOTES IT SWAYED AND HOW MANY PEOPLE IT PULLED. THE DEMOCRATS, SEEING AGAIN, THIS SAVAGE, INHUMANE THING. I TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE CHURCH, ABOUT EVANGELICALS, IN MOST EVANGELICAL CHURCHES, THEY'RE STILL PREACHING THE BIBLE. THEY'RE STILL PREACHING THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, AND SO FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE CHURCH AND THEY'RE HEARING THE PREACHER EVERY WEEK. IT'S THE ANTITHESIS OF A SMIRK, A MOCKING, ABOUT AN 82-YEAR-OLD GRANDMOTHER. WE DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO THE HOUR OF POWER HERE, BUT YOU READ THE RED LETTERS IN THE GOSPEL, AND ALL IT IS IS JESUS TALKING ABOUT LOVING YOUR ENEMIES, PRAYING FOR THOSE WHO PERSECUTE YOU. IF YOU ONLY LOVE THOSE WHO LOVE YOU, WHAT GOOD ARE YOU DOING? EVEN SINNERS DO THAT. YOU KNOW, AND THE PARTIAL OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN, YOU KNOW, SOMEBODY WHO IS AN ENEMY IS BEATEN UP AND ATTACKED AND ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND A BUSINESSMAN RUSHES PAST HIM, AND A PRIEST RUSHES PAST HIM, AND YET, SOMEONE WHO IS AN ENEMY OF THE SAMARITANS, CONSIDER THEM IMMORTAL ENEMIES, STOPS, PICKS UP THE MAN, TAKES CARE OF HIS WOUNDS, TAKES HIM TO AN INN, TELLS THE INNKEEPER, I'M GOING TO PAY FOR THIS GUY. LET THIS GUY, NURSE THIS GUY BACK TO HEALTH. I'LL COME BACK AND PAY YOU FOR IT. THAT'S HOW JESUS TELLS US TO TREAT OUR ENEMIES. WHY DO I BRING THAT UP? BECAUSE ED, THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTING THE MOST HORRIFICALLY OUT THERE, YOU MATCH IT UP. THEY'RE WRAPPING THEMSELVES IN THE AMERICAN FLAG AND THEY'RE PUTTING A CHRISTIAN NATIONALIST CROSS IN FRONT OF THEM WHEN ACTUALLY THIS SORT OF LANGUAGE AND THIS SORT OF ACTION AND THE DECLARATION THAT JESUS WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN CRUCIFIED IF ONLY HE HAD AN AR-15. THIS IS THE ANTITHESIS OF EVERYTHING JESUS PREACHED IN HIS LIFE.  AND I HAVE TO SAY, SORT OF PICKING UP ON NICE SURPRISES FROM TUESDAY NIGHT. LAUREN BOEBERT POTENTIALLY LOSING SOMEBODY WHO HAD HER KIDS ON HER CHRISTMAS CARD WITH AR-15s. AS HER CHRISTMAS MESSAGE WOULD BE, I THINK, A NICE REBUKE FROM THE UNIVERSE. I WAS AFRAID YOU WERE GOING TO ASK ME ABOUT SORT OF JESUS THEOLOGICALLY. IN TERMS OF THE ELECTORAL IMPACT OF THIS, WE SPEND OUR TIME DAY AND NIGHT, ALL THE TIME, FOLLOWING POLITICS AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS. WE'RE VERY UNUSUAL. WE'RE LIKE STAMP COLLECTORS OR SOMETHING. MOST PEOPLE DON'T PAY THAT MUCH ATTENTION AND ONLY REALLY START TO FOCUS IN THE FEW DAYS BEFORE POLLING DAY. THIS ATTACK ON PELOSI, THE EXTRAORDINARY GRACELESSNESS, THE SORT OF MALEVOLENCE OF SOME OF THE REPUBLICAN RESPONSES I MEAN, THE BIGG S1 WAS ONE OF THE WORST. AND NOT JUST REPUBLICANS, ELON MUSK, YOU KNOW, DID THE EQUIVALENT OF A SMIRK ON TWITTER. WHICH RIGHTLY CAUSED MASSIVE BLOW BACK TO HIS CLAIM THAT HE'S GOING TO CREATE A FAIR DIGITAL PUBLIC SQUARE. I FEEL EXTREMELY BUOYED BY MOST PEOPLE'S REACTION. WE HAVE TAKEN THE PULSE OF MOST AMERICANS ARE. THEY'RE NOT LIKE THIS. AND THIS DOESN'T PAY, AND SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO JESUS AND THE GOOD SAMARITAN, YOU HAVE MADE THAT POINT VERY WELL, JOE, AND I THINK WHETHER YOU CALL THIS A RELIGIOUS FEELING OR A CHRISTIAN ONE THAN THE CHRISTIAN NATIONALIST ONE. THERE IS A SENSE OF DECENCY THAT I THINK HAS BEEN UPHELD OVER THIS REALLY NASTY EPISODE WITH PAUL PELOSI.  JEN PALMIERI, TO KATTY'S POINT, AND SOMETHING JOE SAID EARLIER, I THINK A LOT OF VOTERS DID LOOK AT THE ATTACK ON PAUL PELOSI, THE REACTION TO IT. I'M NOT SAYING IT WAS DETERMINATIVE IN THEIR VOTE, AND JUST SAID YUCK, I DON'T WANT OUR POLITICS TO BE LIKE THIS. I DON'T WANT TO LIVE IN THIS CULTURE. LET'S BE HUMAN, LET'S BE DECENT AND THEY DECIDED TO PULL BACK ON SOME CANDIDATES WHO WERE BEHAVING THIS WAY. SO NOW AS YOU LOOK AHEAD, AS YOU LOOK AT THE MAP, AS YOU LOOK AT ARIZONA, NEVADA, STILL TWISTING OUT THERE, AND IT MAY BE ANOTHER WEEK OR SO BEFORE WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON, WHICH WILL DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT GEORGIA GETS ALL THE ATTENTION OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. HOW ARE THINGS LOOKING AFTER THIS SURPRISINGLY UPBEAT NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS.  I FEEL LIKE THAT VOTERS ARE STARTING TO ERECT A NEW GUARDRAIL FOR DEMOCRACY. IT'S NOT PERFECT. IT'S NOT COMPLETE YET, BUT WHEN I THINK BACK TO WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 9th, 2016, TO WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 9th, 2022. AND, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF CARNAGE IN BETWEEN, A LOT OF EROSION OF RIGHTS, A LOT OF PAIN, A LOT OF TROUBLE BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RESULTS, YOU KNOW, LOOK AT THE RESULTS IN A STATE LIKE MICHIGAN, FOR EXAMPLE, SOMEPLACE I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN, THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR THERE NOT ONLY WON, SHE WON BY 10% POINTS, WHICH IS EVEN MORE THAN SHE WAS PROJECTED TO WIN. SHE GOT MORE VOTES THIS TIME THAN LAST TIME. MORE PEOPLE VOTED IN 2022 THAN VOTED IN 2018. THE FIGHT THERE TO PROTECT ABORTION RIGHTS PLUS FIGHT ON THE ECONOMY, PLUS PROTECT DEMOCRACY, THE CANDIDATES THERE FROM THE HOUSE, ELISSA SLOTKIN TO GRETCHEN WHITMER, TO MALLORY MORROW WHO'S SO GOOD ABOUT THIS, THEY MADE A COMPLETE ARGUMENT AND VOTERS REWARDED THAT. BUT LIKE, KARI LAKE MAY BECOME GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA TONIGHT, SO IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT A STRAIGHT LINE.  LET'S TALK ABOUT MICHIGAN FOR A SECOND. REPUBLICAN VIOLENCE, AND MAGA EXTREMISM. WHAT DID MICHIGAN VOTERS SEE AND HEAR FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS? EXTREMISTS TALKING ABOUT PLOTTING TO KIDNAP THE GOVERNOR. PUT HER ON TRIAL, AND POSSIBLY KILL HER. THAT EXTREMISM WAS THERE. MOST AMERICANS, THEY SUPPORT THE MISSISSIPPI LAW, WHICH IS 15 WEEKS. THAT'S WHERE MOST AMERICANS ARE. BUT WHERE GRETCHEN WHITMER'S OPPONENT WAS, WAS AGAIN, LITERALLY TALKING ABOUT A 14-YEAR-OLD RAPE VICTIM WHO WAS RAPED BY AN UNCLE BEING A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHY THAT GIRL AND HER FAMILY AND HER PASTOR AND HER DOCTOR AND HER MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR SHOULD HAVE NO SAY IN WHAT SHE DOES. THE EXTREMISM THERE LED AND THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" EDITORIAL PAGE THAT WILLIE'S BROUGHT UP TALKS ABOUT IT. THE EXTREMISM LED -- I WON'T EVEN CALL IT THE MICHIGAN MIRACLE. BECAUSE IT WAS JUST A RESPONSE TO THE CRAZY WEIRDOS, FREAKS AND INSURRECTIONISTS IN MICHIGAN, AND CAUSED A POLITICAL REVOLUTION. AGAIN, LET'S SAY THIS, IN AN OFF YEAR ELECTION THAT HISTORICALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN HORRIBLE FOR THEM, WITH INFLATION INCREDIBLY HIGH, WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN HORRIBLE FOR THEM, WITH FEARS OVER CRIME RISING AND YET IN ALL OF THAT, THEY WON EVERYTHING IN MICHIGAN, ONE OF THE BIGGEST STATES IN AMERICA.  BOTH HOUSES IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 40 YEARS. I TALKED TO WHITMER'S STAFF IN THE YEAR EARLIER, THEY SAID, MAYBE IN A FEW YEARS, AND IT JUST, IT'S A MAJORITY OF SEATS ON THE SUPREME COURT. IT'S, YOU KNOW, GOVERNORS, SECRETARY OF STATE, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. ALL WHICH HAPPEN TO BE WOMEN, BY THE WAY. IT'S THE, YOU KNOW, THE WOMEN THAT WON THE HOUSE RACES. ELISSA SLOTKIN, SHE PULLED IT OUT TOO. TALK ABOUT THE PERSONIFICATION OF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN AMERICA, COVID, ARMED PROTESTS, THE LOCKDOWN STARTED THERE, THE ASSASSINATION PLOT.  INSIDE THE LEGISLATURE, THEY'RE BRINGING AR-15s INSIDE THE LEGISLATURE. MEMO TO REPUBLICANS. YOU BRING AR-15s INSIDE OF LEGISLATURES AND YOU SCREAM AT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS, DOESN'T GO WELL, RIGHT?  I MEAN, I WAS THERE. I WAS THERE LATER IN SEPTEMBER WHEN MORE ARMED PROTESTERS SHOWED UP IN 2020. AND THEN DIXON, WHO THE REPUBLICANS WANTED. SHE WAS THE CANDIDATE THAT THEY WANTED, SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS GOOD. THAT ANSWER ON ABORTION JUST LIKE PUT HER IN THE BOX FROM THE BEGINNING. AND, YOU KNOW, SHE TRIED TO RECOVER FROM IT. SHE ACTUALLY ENDED UP BEING A GOOD CAMPAIGNER. I SPENT TIME WITH HER ON SUNDAY NIGHT. SHE WAS GOOD. SHE WAS GLENN YOUNGKIN KIND OF GOOD, BUT TO OVERCOME WHAT PEOPLE KNEW ABOUT HER ON ABORTION, PLUS THAT ATMOSPHERE IN MICHIGAN WAS JUST, YOU KNOW, IT WAS TOO MUCH. BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM HOW GOOD THE CANDIDATES WERE. THEY ARGUED THEIR CASE WELL, MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR VOTERS.  JEN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. ED LUCE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. ED, OF COURSE, THE SPONSOR OF BUBBLE BATH, HE'S GOING TO BE SOAKING IN IT FOR THE NEXT WEEK.  BUT IT BRINGS HIM NO JOY.  IT BRINGS HIM NO JOY.  THANK YOU, ED. CAN YOU PUT, TJ, THAT GRAPHIC UP AGAIN. LOOK AT THAT. LOOK AT THAT IN MICHIGAN. LOOK AT THAT. AND IT'S A PRETTY MODERATE, PRETTY CONSERVATIVE STATE.  IT'S A MODERATE STATE. ABORTION WAS ON THE BALLOT.  AND SO WHEN YOU'RE THE CANDIDATE WHO GOES OUT AND SAYS, WELL, HAVING THE BABY AFTER BEING RAPED CAN BE HEALING FOR A TEENAGE GIRL. WHEN YOU'RE THE CANDIDATE WHO MADE THE POINT YOU MADE EARLIER ABOUT A 14-YEAR-OLD, THE BEST EXAMPLE OF BEING RAPED BY AN UNCLE OF WHY WE HAVE TO STOP ABORTION, YOU'RE GOING TO LOSE IF THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE FOR ALMOST HALF OF THE VOTERS. REMEMBER THE ANALYSIS ON OUR SHOW AND OTHERS FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS, MAYBE ABORTION HAS RECEDE ED. MAYBE DOBBS HAPPENED TOO SOON TO BE BENEFICIALLY POLITICALLY. THERE IT IS IN MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA.  THE THREE MOST IMPORTANT STATES IN 2024 ARE GOING TO BE WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, AND PENNSYLVANIA. REPUBLICANS HAD A GREAT CHANCE OF ROLLING UP SOME GAINS THERE. McCORMICK, IF THEY PUT McCORMICK IN THE SENATE. IF THEY HAD GOTTEN SOMEBODY WHO WASN'T A CRAZY FREAK RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR THAT WASN'T AN INSURRECTIONIST, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, REPUBLICANS SOMETIMES WILL TUNE IN, AND WILL SAY TO ME, OH, YOU'RE BEING SO NEGATIVE. NO, I'M NOT, I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU WIN. IT'S JUST NOT THAT HARD. YOU BRING AR-15s TO STATE LEGISLATURES, THINKING YOU LOOK TOUGH, AND YOU SHOUT AT LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS THAT THEY'RE THE ENEMIES. YOU TRY TO KIDNAP THE GOVERNOR AND BLAME IT ON THE FBI. YOU SAY THAT 14-YEAR-OLD GIRLS THAT GET RAPED BY THEIR UNCLE IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF SOMETHING? THIS ALL ADDS UP. ME TELLING YOU THAT'S STUPID, THAT'S ME TRYING TO HELP YOU. ALL RIGHT. IF YOU HAD LISTENED TO A LOT OF THINGS WE SAID THROUGH THE YEARS, YOU WOULDN'T FIND YOURSELF IN THIS POSITION THIS MORNING. I'M SORRY. WE DON'T USUALLY TALK THAT WAY. IT'S JUST THE TRUTH. EXTREMISM DOESN'T WORK. AND, WILLIE, IN MICHIGAN, AGAIN A SWING STATE IN A YEAR THAT SHOULD HAVE BROKEN WILDLY FOR REPUBLICANS, AND NOW DEMOCRATS OWN MICHIGAN. DEMOCRATS OWN PENNSYLVANIA. DEMOCRATS OWN THE GOVERNORSHIP IN WISCONSIN. AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON THEY SHOULD HAVE WON ANY OF THOSE STATES.  REPUBLICAN PETER MEYER WHO DEFIED DONALD TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP PRIMARIED HIM WITH JOHN GIBBS. JOHN GIBBS, WHO'S CERTIFIABLY, WAY WAY OUT THERE.  BEYOND HERSCHEL.  YEAH, BEYOND HERSCHEL. DONALD TRUMP PUTS HIS HANDS ON JOHN GIBBS, YOU'RE THE NEXT CANDIDATE, HE GETS WIPED OUT.  GRAND RAPIDS, THIS IS NOT A DEMOCRATIC STATE, BELIEVE ME.  GERALD FORD.  JUST CLASSIC REPUBLICAN. AND, YOU KNOW.  DEMOCRAT NOW.  FOR THE FIRST TIME IN ALMOST 50 YEARS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US. > THE CHAIR OF THE DCCC LOST HIS RACE IN NEW YORK'S HUDSON VALLEY. IT APPEARS DEMOCRATS HAVE HELD ON TO ANOTHER CLOSELY WATCHED SEAT IN THE AREA. DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN, PAT RYAN WHOSE OPPONENT HAS CONCEDED THE RACE, JOINS US NEXT. HAS CONCED RACE, JOINS US NEXT. 20221110115819.828|20221110115956.857",

        "trs": "NORTH CAROLINA STATE SENATOR WYLIE NICHOLS MADE HIS NATIONAL TELEVISION DEBUT AS A CONGRESSIONAL DEBUT ON OUR PROGRAM. NOW HE IS A WINNER ON HIS WAY TO WASHINGTON.  THIS IS A WIN ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE. FOLKS ARE TIRED OF FAR-RIGHT EXTREMISTS. IF YOU RUN AS A HUNTER PERCENT PRO TRUMP IN A DISTRICT LIKE THIS, YOU'RE GONNA LOSE. THE MESSAGE WE SEND WITH THIS, A FAR-RIGHT EXTREMISTS ARE GOING TO BE REJECTED BY VOTERS BECAUSE THEY KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, AND WE GET TO SEND THAT MESSAGE WITH THIS WIN.  THAT IS DEMOCRATIC RESENTMENT REPRESENTATIVE ELECT WILEY NICKEL WHO'S CELEBRATING A DECISIVE VICTORY IN NORTH CAROLINA'S 13TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT. OVER REPUBLICAN BO HINES. THE NEW YORK TIMES SAID QUOTE BARRAGE HINES WAS SEEN AS A RISING STAR AND BY SOME IN THE TRUMP WING OF THE PARTY. BO HINES SAID ACCESS TO ABORTION FOR RAPE AND INCEST VICTIMS SHOULD BE DECIDED BY WHAT HE CALLED A COMMUNITY LEVEL REVIEW.  ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU WOULD ACCEPT AN EXCEPTION FOR RAPE OR INCEST IN NORTH CAROLINA?  I THINK IN CERTAIN CASES YES IN, A CASE LIKE THAT WERE A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL I SHOULD SAY, OBVIOUSLY SHE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH THAT PREGNANCY. THAT'S A HORRIFIC TRAGEDY THERE HAS TO BE EXCEPTIONS IN PLACE FOR.  SO IS IT MORE THE RAPE AND INCEST OR HER AGE?  I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF BOTH, BUT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL CASE, LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCE AND WHAT HAPPENS THERE.  JOINING US NOW IS REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT WILEY NICKEL OF NORTH CAROLINA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR RETURNING TO US AND JOINING US TONIGHT. IT'S A REAL PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU HERE. WAS THAT THE DECISIVE MOMENT IN YOUR CAMPAIGN WHEN HE SAID THAT ABOUT WHAT THE TEN YEAR OLD GIRL WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH AFTER BEING A VICTIM OF RAPE OR INCEST?  IT WAS CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT MOMENT FOR OUR CAMPAIGN BECAUSE IT SHOWED WHAT FAR-RIGHT EXTREMISTS WE WERE UP AGAINST. IT'S AN ISSUE WE KEEP CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT. BECAUSE WOMEN'S RIGHTS WERE ON THE BALLOT THIS ELECTION. CASE BY CASE COMMITTEE LEVEL REVIEW FOR VICTIMS OF RAPE WAS SOMETHING THAT IS FAR OUT OF STEP WITH VOTERS IN THIS DISTRICT.  IT WAS A VERY CLOSE RACE THAT YOU WON. YOU ARE A STATE SENATOR, YOU COULD'VE STAYED PRESUMABLY IN THE STATE SENATE. WHAT MADE YOU MAKE THE DECISION TO TAKE THIS RISK AND RUN FOR THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES?  I WANTED TO DO ALL I COULD THAT WE CONTINUE TO MAKE GAINS IN CONGRESS. THIS RACE WAS REALLY ABOUT SENDING A MESSAGE. I'M GLAD TO BE GOING TO CONGRESS TO REPRESENT THE 13TH DISTRICT, BUT WE WERE ABLE TO SEND A MESSAGE FOR ANY SWING DISTRICTS, THIS WAS A 50/50 SEE, THAT IF YOU STAND 100 PERCENT PRO TRUMP. SAY YOU WANT TO BE A MAGA WARRIOR, YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE AT THE BALLOT BOX. FOR ANYONE ELSE WHO STANDS WITH MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE, MADISON CAWTHORN, AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, THEY MADE TWO OKAY IN REPUBLICAN PLUS 20 DISTRICTS, BUT WE ARE GOING TO REJECT THEM AT THE BALLOT BOX IN SWING DISTRICTS LIKE THIS ONE.  DO YOU KNOW IF IT WAS HELPFUL IN YOUR RACE TO HAVE CHERI BEASLEY RUNNING AS STRONG A CAMPAIGN AS SHE DID STATEWIDE FOR SENATE?  I THINK ABSOLUTELY. WE WON AS YOU SAW THERE JUST BY LITTLE OVER TWO POINTS. A LOT OF PEOPLE CAME OUT TO VOTE FOR CHERI BEASLEY AND IF SHE HADN'T RUN SUCH A STRONG CAMPAIGN, THERE'S A CHANCE I MIGHT NOT HAVE WON THIS RACE. SO IN A CLOSE ELECTION LIKE THIS, EVERYTHING MATTERS, AND SHE DID A REALLY GOOD JOB, MAKING SURE THE PEOPLE GOT OUT TO VOTE.  WILEY NICKEL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US DURING THE CAMPAIGN SO THAT VOTERS COULD ACTUALLY HEAR FROM YOU DURING THE CAMPAIGN. REALLY APPRECIATE IT.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING. WE  THANK YOU. VOTERS IN MICHIGAN VOTED 57 TO 43 TO MAKE ABORTION A RIGHT BY ADDING IT TO THE STATE CONSTITUTION. MICHIGAN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER WAS REELECTED WITH MORE THAN 54% OF THE VOTE AND DEMOCRATS WON CONTROL OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 40 YEARS. JOINING US NOW IS DEMOCRATIC MICHIGAN STATE SENATOR MALLORY MCMORROW WHO WON REELECTION LAST NIGHT. SENATOR, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US AGAIN TONIGHT. WHAT WAS THE KEY, LET'S CONCENTRATE FOR THE MOMENT ON THE LEGISLATIVE VICTORY. WHAT WAS THE KEY ON WINNING THAT CONTROL OF THE LEGISLATURE?  THIS IS INCREDIBLE. LAST NIGHT SENT AN EARTHQUAKE THROUGH MICHIGAN AND THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, AND REALLY IT WAS ABOUT FOCUSING ON THE STATE LEGISLATURE WHICH I HAVE BEEN STRANDED SINCE APRIL, MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE RESOURCES EARLY. WE ARE ABLE TO RECRUIT AND CREDIBLE CANDIDATES ALL ACROSS THE STATE WHO FIT THEIR DISTRICTS PERFECTLY, WE WERE ABLE TO GET UP ON THE TV AND ON THE FIELD WITH POSITIVE MESSAGES, THAT SENT SUCH A STRONG REBUKE TO THIS POLITICS OF DIVISIVENESS THE POLITICS -- THAT VOTERS ARE TIRED OF.  WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION EARLIER TONIGHT IN OUR ELECTION COVERAGE BUT THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY NOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO WHAT YOU ACHIEVED IN MICHIGAN. NOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO STATE LEGISLATURES AND THE ELECTIONS THERE AND HOW IMPORTANT THEY ARE. WHAT IS YOUR FEELING ABOUT THAT THE NATIONAL PARTY'S ATTENTION TONIGHT?  I HOPE THAT THIS VICTORY AND IT'S A BIG ONE. MICHIGAN IS ONE OF THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL BATTLEGROUND STATES. WE NOW HAVE A BLUE TRIFECTA HEADING INTO 2024. I HOPE THAT THIS SENDS A MESSAGE THAT WITH THIS IS WHERE WE HAVE TO FOCUS OUR TIME, EFFORT ENERGY AND RESOURCES, WHERE THESE ARE RACES THAT ARE RUN WITH THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, NOT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. WE JUST NEED OUR CANDIDATES TO HAVE THE RIGHT RESOURCES. AND WITH THE ISSUE OF ABORTION, WE KNOW THAT ROLE FELL BECAUSE OF A DOWN BALLOT CLAPS IN STATE LEGISLATURES DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION THAT LED TO THESE EXTREME ANTI ABORTION LAWS BEING PASSED OUT OF STATE AFTER STATE AFTER STATE. SO IF WE REALLY WANT TO BUILD POWER BACK, WE HAVE TO START ON THE GROUND IN STATE LEGISLATURES AND WE DID HERE IN MICHIGAN.  THERE IS ANOTHER POINT ABOUT STATE LEGISLATURES THAT I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED WHY IT DOESN'T GET MORE ATTENTION, AND THAT THAT IS THAT BARACK OBAMA WHO IS A FORMER PRESIDENT TONIGHT BECAUSE HE RAN A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN TO BECOME PART OF THE ILLINOIS STATE LEGISLATURE. THAT'S HOW HE GOT STARTED AND ACTUALLY WINNING ELECTIVE OFFICE. WE JUST HAD A MEMBER OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN NORTH CAROLINA WHO WAS OUR GUEST WHO IS NOW GOING ON TO CONGRESS. WOULD HE BE GOING ON TO CONGRESS IF YOU HAD ME TO SUCCESSFUL STATE CENTER LIKE YOURSELF? IT'S MORE THAN A TRAINING GROUND FOR THESE OTHER OFFICES, BUT IT IS ALSO A GOOD TRAINING GROUND FOR OTHER OFFICES?  IT ABSOLUTELY IS AND BEYOND THAT, THIS IS WHERE WE BUILD ACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH VOTERS. YOU MAY NOT EVER SEE YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS OR U.S. SENATOR IN YOUR COMMUNITY EXCEPT FOR MAYBE AT A BIG EVENT. BUT YOU WILL SEE YOUR STATE LEGISLATOR, AT THE GROCERY STORE, AT A BAR, AT A RESTAURANT AND, A COFFEE HOUR ALMOST REGULARLY IN OUR DISTRICT. THIS IS WHERE WE AS A PARTY CAN BUILD REAL MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS WITH VOTERS THAT'S ALSO EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED TO BE BUILDING SO WE HAVE PEOPLE IN TOUCH WITH WHAT VOTERS ARE REALLY FEELING, AND THAT WE ARE SET UP TO HAVE A REALLY SUCCESSFUL ELECTION MOVING FORWARD.  LET'S CONSIDER THE GOVERNOR'S CAMPAIGN IN YOUR STATE. WE HAVE SEEN THE GOVERNOR GOING THROUGH SO MUCH FROM THE PLOT TO KIDNAP AND MURDER HER AND THIS INCREDIBLE THREAT THAT SHE'S BEEN UNDER WHILE IN OFFICE. NOT ONLY HAS SHE DEALT WITH THAT, BUT SHE ALSO HAD TO DEAL WITH THE PANDEMIC INTERSTATES RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. AND WE SEE THAT SHE ALSO HAD TO RUN A REELECTION CAMPAIGN. TALK ABOUT THE WAY YOUR GOVERNOR ACHIEVED THIS DECISIVE VICTORY. WHAT WAS THE KEY TO HER DECISIVE VICTORY?  NUMBER ONE, SHE IS AN INCREDIBLY RELATE-ABLE REPRESENTATIVE. SHE'S GOT TO HELL AND BACK SHE TALKS ABOUT IT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. SHE'S GONNA GET UP AND DUSTER SELF OFTEN KEEP ONGOING. PEOPLE COINED, OR DONALD TRUMP QUINTER THAT WOMAN FROM MICHIGAN, AND SHE TOOK IT AS A BADGE OF HONOR. IF YOU GO ACROSS THE STATE, EVERY WOMAN IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN FEELS LIKE THAT WOMAN FROM MICHIGAN. AND THIS ELECTION FELT LIKE A CHALLENGE, DON'T MESS WITH THOSE WOMEN FROM MICHIGAN. WE STOOD BEHIND HER, SHE WAS STRONG, SHE WANTS TO STAND WITH THIS THAT WOMEN'S WERE A BIT ACTIVE RIGHT IS A RIGHT LONG BEFORE DOBBS CAME DOWN, LONG BEFORE WE LOST OUR RIGHT. IT'S SENT THIS MESSAGE THAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY HUNGRY FOR THAT WE NEED REGULAR, RELATED PEOPLE WHO TALK ABOUT THEIR FAMILIES IN THEIR VALUES, AND WE NEED PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO FIGHT FOR YOU EVERY DAY SINGLE DAY, AND SHE DOES THAT BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE OUT THERE.  WHAT ACHIEVEMENTS ARE YOU HOPING THAT THE DEMOCRATIC -CONTROLLED LEGISLATURE WILL BE ABLE TO BRING TO VOTERS WHEN THE NEXT REELECTION CAMPAIGN OCCURS?  WE'VE GOT 40 YEARS OF AN AGENDA IN THE MAKING AND NUMBER ONE, ABORTION IS REALLY THE ISSUE, REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS THAT GOT US ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. SO EVEN THOUGH WE PASSED THREE AND IS THE RIGHT IN OUR CONSTITUTION INA, WE HAVE TO REPEAL THE 1931 ABORTION BAN TO SEND A MESSAGE TO VOTERS, WE HEAR YOU, WE'RE LISTENING. THAT'S PERFECT PROTECTING VOTING RIGHTS, IT'S MAKING SURE WE AMEND OUR STATE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT TO PROTECT THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY, AND THAT IS PROTECTING PUBLIC EDUCATION. THIS IS THE HOME OF BETSY ROSS, THE FIGHT AGAINST PROTECTING CLEAN WATER, THIS IS EVEN STATE, MAKING IT EASIER FOR VOTERS TO WORKERS TO ORGANIZE, MORE EXCITED TO GET THAT AGENDA.  MISSION STATE SENATOR MALLORY MCMORROW THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING. US REALLY APPRECIATED.  THANKS LAWRENCE.  COMING UP. WE WILL BE JOINED BY AND WHOLE HAVE DEMOCRATIC BEAT OR REPUBLICAN MEMBER OF CONGRESS. OUR LIST OF WINNERS CONTINUES HERE. REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT GREG LANDS AND JOINS US NEXT.

        "trs": "LAST NIGHT AND TODAY PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD A LOT OF PHONE CALLS TO MAKE TWO WINNERS.  HEY BUDDY, JOE BIDEN, CONGRATULATIONS MAN.  GRATULATION, JOE BIDEN.  CONGRATULATIONS.   I'M BETTER NOW THAT YOU WANT, I'LL TELL YOU.  CONGRATULATIONS, I'M SO HAPPY, I REALLY AM.  CONGRATULATIONS, AND SO EXCITED FOR YOU.  I THINK WITH THE GRACE OF GOD IN THE, GOODWILL OF NEIGHBORS, ALL THE STUFF WE DID IS ONLY GONNA COME TO FRUITION NEXT YEAR. BECAUSE THEY HEARD ABOUT IT BUT THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IT. I THINK THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO. IT'S REALLY, REALLY GOING TO MATTER.  I'M SO EXCITED. , GOD LOVE YOU. , I'LL SLEEP BETTER KNOWING YOU ONE. KEEP THE FAITH, MAN TALK TO.  JOINING US NOW AND ONE OF THE DEMOCRATS WHO FLIPPED A REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL SEAT REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT GREG LANDON, ONE OHIO'S FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT DEFEATING STEVE SHABBAT WAS FIRST ELECTED IN 1994. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. DID YOU GET A CALL FROM JOE BIDEN?  I DID. HE COULD'VE BEEN KINDER MORE EXCITED AND OBVIOUSLY IT WAS A REALLY EXCITING MOMENTS WINNING WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BUT GETTING A CALL FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS A BIG DEAL.  DID HE GET INTO THE DETAILS WITH YOU OF HOW YOU WANT? DID HE WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU PULL IT OFF IN WHOLE AISLE?  I THINK HE WAS PAYING VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING HERE AND IN OTHER RACES, SO WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT. THE FACT WAS THAT IT WAS A RACE WHERE WE HAD DEMOCRATS AND A LOT OF REPUBLICANS COMING TOGETHER TO BEAT BACK THE KIND OF CHAOS AND EXTREMISM THAT FOLKS ARE JUST FRUSTRATED WITH. SHABBAT WHO YOU KNOW HAS BEEN THERE FOR ALMOST THREE DECADES WAS SORT OF A DO NOTHING OR INNOCUOUS BACKBENCHER. BUT WHEN TRUMP GOT ON THE SCENE, HE REALLY DROVE ALL IN AND WAS PART OF THE GROUP TO TRY TO OVERTURN THE ELECTION ON JANUARY 6TH, AND THAT WAS JUST TOO MUCH FOR A LOT OF INDEPENDENTS AND A SURPRISING NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS WHO JUST WANT THAT TO AND. AND THEN HE'S ALSO, MY OPPONENT WAS VERY WELL KNOWN AS AN ANTI CHOICE EXTREMIST. THAT CAUGHT UP TO HIM WITH THE DOBBS DECISION. FOLKS JUST DON'T WANT WHAT HE WANTS WHICH IS THE FULL BAN ON ABOUT ON ABORTIONS WITH NO EXCEPTIONS. RAPE, INCEST, LIFE OF THE MOTHER, IT DOESN'T MATTER TO HIM. , SO I THINK THEY SENT A STRONG VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IF YOU'RE GONNA BE IN A COMPETITIVE DISTRICT LIKE THIS ONE AND IT'S VERY CAN COMPETITIVE THE BIG LIE AND EXTREMISM IS NOT GONNA FLY.  WHAT IS GOING TO BE YOUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES?  I THINK IT'S GOTTA BE ALL OF OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN THAT IS THE ECONOMY. NOT JUST DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF INFLATION, BUT REALLY FIXING THIS ECONOMY THAT IS BEING BROKEN FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S NOT NEW, IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES. WE'VE GOT TO GET WAGES UP, COST DOWN, ACROSS THE BOARD, NOT JUST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS BUT HOUSING AND CHILDCARE. I HOPE THERE IS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THE JOB TAX CREDIT WHICH WAS INCREDIBLY INFECTIVE IN HELPING MILLIONS OF FAMILIES PAY THEIR BILLS. I THINK THERE'S ALSO BEGUN TO BE CONSENSUS ON PUBLIC SAFETY, AFFECTING IN POLICE AND FIRE, AND HELPING COMMUNITIES WITH BUDGET SHORTFALLS SO THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH CRIME. AND IT FOR US LOCALLY, WE'VE GOT TO GET, WE'VE GOT A BIG BRIDGE THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED. THE MONEY IS THERE BUT WE NEED LEADERSHIP TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THE BRIDGE DONE AND DONE WELL.  REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT CHRIS LANDSMAN WHO IN THE HOUSE OF RESENT REPRESENTATIVES WILL BE MR. LANDSMAN OF OHIO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THANK YOU. JOINING US NOW IS REPRESENTATIVE ALIKE-ELECT AMELIA SITES WAS ELECTED TO TIM RYAN'S HOUSE SEAT IN OHIO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. YOU ARE RUNNING IN A SEAT THAT IT ALREADY BEEN OCCUPIED BY A DEMOCRAT BUT IT WAS A BIG MOVE FOR YOU TO GO FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE, HAS OF REPRESENTATIVES TO NOW TO THE HOUSE IN WASHINGTON. WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE TO MAKE THE RUN FOR CONGRESS?  I MADE THE DECISION TO RUN FOR CONGRESS BECAUSE OF MY COMMUNITY. WE DESPERATELY NEED A VOICE THAT IS GOING TO STAND UP FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN AFFORD THE EVERY EXPENSES IN THE COMMUNITY, GAS, MORTGAGE, HEALTH CARE, THAT PROTECTING OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AS WELL AS MAKING SURE WE HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY FOR DOUBLE HEALTH CARE INCLUDING ABORTION HERE IN OHIO 13. WHEN THIS DISTRICT WAS REDRAWN, WHICH WAS FAR MORE REPUBLICAN THAN WHEN TIM RYAN CURRENTLY HOLDS, I KNEW THAT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THIS COMMUNITY AND FOR THIS COUNTRY TO ENSURE THAT THERE WAS A FIGHTER FOR DEMOCRACY AS WELL. AND SO I WAS EXCITED TO BE THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE AND, EVEN MORE EXCITED AND I'LL BE REPRESENTING MY HOMETOWN, MY COMMUNITY IN CONGRESS NEXT YEAR.  NOW YOU HAVE AN UNUSUAL ELEMENT OF YOUR BIO THAT IS BOTH YOU AND YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR FATHER SERVED IN THE OHIO STATE LEGISLATURE. WHAT DID THEY TEACH YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE NOW DOING FOR A LIVING?  WELL, THEY TAUGHT ME THAT FIRST OF ALL, MY JOB IS TO SERVE THE PUBLIC, AND I COME FROM A LONG LINE OF PUBLIC SERVANTS INCLUDING MY SISTER WHO IS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM, MY BROTHER WHO IS A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER. MY HUSBAND WHO IS IN PUBLIC SERVICE. WE HAVE MADE IT OUR MISSION TO LIVE OUR LIVES TO GET BACK TO OTHERS. WE HAVE RECEIVED SO MUCH FOR THESE COMMUNITIES THAT WE LIVE IN, AND THE LEAST THAT WE CAN DO IS TO GIVE BACK. SO ORIGINALLY I WASN'T SURE IF ELECTED OFFICE WAS GOING TO BE MY PATH BUT CERTAINLY AND SO GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THIS COMMUNITY TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S FIGHTING FOR THEM, THINKING THOSE EVERYDAY ISSUES THAT CONTINUE TO PLAGUE THEM. I DO ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN THIS RACE AND THIS COMMUNITY TO VISIT MY WEBSITE. IT'S 1 MILLION SYKES FOR CONGRESS.COM, AND LEARN WHY WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR ME TO RUN FOR THE SEAT TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY AS WELL AS OUR COUNTRY.  DID YOU GET A WINNERS PHONE CALL FROM JOE BIDEN?  YES I DID GET A PHONE CALL. HE WAS VERY GRACIOUS AND COMPLIMENTARY. BUT I THINK THAT ONE THING I GOT FROM THAT PHONE CALL IS THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. THERE ARE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE COUNTING ON US TO PUT ASIDE OUR POLITICAL AND PARTISAN DIFFERENCES, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WORKING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ELECTED US, AND ENSURING THAT THIS IS THE BEST COUNTRY TO LIVE IN. I KNOW THAT NORTHEAST OHIO IS THE BEST PLACE TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY AND THE WORK THAT I WILL DO AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS WILL BE REFLECTIVE OF THEM AND I'M SO EXCITED. WE WERE ORIGINALLY COUNTED OUT IN THIS RACE, VERY MUCH SO. I THINK THAT REPUBLICANS THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD, HE WAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE RACE IN THE STATE, ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE COUNTRY, BUT ULTIMATELY OUR COMMUNITY SAID, WE WANT TO FIGHT, OR WE WANT SOMEONE WHO'S GONNA FIGHT FOR US AND THAT'S WHY THEY ELECTED ME. I LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING THEM.  WHAT IS YOUR TOP PRIORITY IN YOUR FIRST YEAR IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES?  MY TOP PRIORITIES MAKING SURE THAT MY COMMUNITIES TAKEN CARE OF. I HEARD ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL THAT THE ECONOMY WAS THEIR NUMBER ONE, SOMETIMES NUMBER TWO AND NUMBER THREE ISSUE. AND WANTED JUST TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD THOSE EVERYDAY EXPENSES AND BE SAFE AND SECURE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. PUBLIC SAFETY WAS VERY IMPORTANT. I'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK AROUND VICTIMS ASSISTANCE AND PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITY WHICH PEOPLE REALLY RESONATED WITH. I WAS A CHAMPION FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT REALLY HELPED RESONATE WITH THE FOLKS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. MOSTLY I SPENT A LOT OF TIME JUST LISTENING AND I WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT IS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE PEOPLE IN THE DISTRICT KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR THEM, AND I WILL MAKE SURE THAT I'M VISITING ALL PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY, ALL PARTS OF OHIO 13 IN MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE A FIGHTER IN ME AS SOMEBODY WHO'S READY TO WORK FOR THEM.  WHAT WE WILL WANT TO BE LISTENING TO YOU HERE ON THIS PROGRAM SO PLEASE COME BACK NEXT YEAR WHEN YOU ARE MEMBER OF THE YEAR. REPRESENTATIVE-ELECT AMELIA SYKES THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING. US  THANK YOU.  THANK YOU. COMING UP, MAXWELL ALEJANDRO FROST IT IS NATIONAL TELEVISION DEBUT AS A CONGRESSIONAL DEBUT ON OUR PROGRAM AND HE WILL NOW BE THE YOUNGEST MEMBER OF CONGRESS.

        "trs": "WELCOME BACK TO DAY TWO OF OUR COVERAGE OF THIS WILD ELECTION, WITH SO MANY RACES STILL UNDECIDED, WITH A LOT OF EXPECTED TO COME IN AT A COURSE AT THIS NEXT HOUR. WHILE WE HAVE BEEN WAITING TO FIND OUT WHO ULTIMATELY WILL CONTROL CONGRESS AND THE U.S. SENATE, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS FLOWN MORE UNDER THE RADAR IS THAT DEMOCRATS ARE HAVING A PHENOMENALLY GOOD ELECTION AT THE STATE LEVEL, AND STATE LEGISLATORS AROUND THE COUNTRY. IN PENNSYLVANIA, DEMOCRATS THINK THEY'VE DONE IT THERE. THEY DIDN'T THEY GAINED CONTROL OF THE HOUSE IN PENNSYLVANIA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN A DECADE. IF THAT HOLDS UP, PENNSYLVANIA DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE MUCH MORE LEVERAGE WHEN IT COMES TO ENACTING THE POLICY AGENDA OF INCOMING GOVERNOR THERE, JUST SHAPIRO. IN MICHIGAN, IT'S MORE STARK THAN THE. THIS WAS THE FIRST ELECTION IN MICHIGAN SINCE THE DISTRICTS THERE WERE DRAWN UP BY A BIPARTISAN CITIZENS COMMISSION INSTEAD OF A PARTISAN SCRUM. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED. MICHIGAN DEMOCRATS FLIP THE STATE HOUSE AND THEY FLIPPED THE STATE SENATE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 40 YEARS, AND BECAUSE MICHIGAN DEMOCRATS ALSO KEPT THE GOVERNORSHIP, WHEN GRETCHEN WHITMER WAS REELECTED, THAT MEANS STILL HAVE A GOVERNING TRIFECTA. DEMOCRATS WILL BE IN CHARGE IN MICHIGAN FOR A CHANGE. THEY'LL HAVE ALL STATEWIDE OFFICES AND THE STATE LEGISLATOR IN BOTH HOUSES. ALSO MINNESOTA, DEMOCRATS AND MINNESOTA, KEPT THEIR MAJORITY IN THE STATE HOUSE, AND THEY FLIP THE STATE SENATE AWAY FROM THE REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE IN MINNESOTA, THEY ALSO KEPT THE GOVERNORSHIP, DEMOCRATS WILL ALSO BE IN CHARGE IN MINNESOTA AS WELL, FULLY IN CHARGE OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT. WHEN I SAY DEMOCRATS AT THE STATE LEVEL HAVE BEEN HAVING A REALLY GOOD ELECTION, I DON'T JUST MEAN WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN ON OFFENSE LIKE IN THE STATES I JUST DESCRIBED. ALSO, IT'S TRUE, IN PLACES WHERE THEY WERE PLAY DEFENSE, FRANKLY, CHECK OUT WHAT HAPPENED IN WISCONSIN, WHERE REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS HAVE BEEN KEPT IN CHECK, JUST BARELY. THIS TIME AROUND, WISCONSIN REPUBLICANS SET THEIR SIGHTS ON TRYING TO GET A VETO PROOF SUPERMAJORITY IN THE STATE LEGISLATOR, WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY RENDER THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR THERE IRRELEVANT. THEY DID NOT GET THEIR SUPERMAJORITY IN WISCONSIN, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THAT STATE IS GERRYMANDERED BEYOND THE POINT OF LIVING DEMOCRACY. THEY FELL SHORT BY TWO SEATS THANKS TO EXCELLENT DEFENSE PLAYED BY THE DEMOCRATS IN WISCONSIN. IT WAS EVEN CLOSER IN NORTH CAROLINA. REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS THEIR THOUGHT THEY WOULD ALSO GET A VETO PROOF SUPERMAJORITY, WHICH AGAIN, WOULD RENDERED THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR THERE EFFECTIVELY IRRELEVANT. NORTH CAROLINA REPUBLICANS DID GET THAT IN THE STATE SENATE, BUT THEY WERE STOPPED IN THE STATE HOUSE. REPUBLICANS FOR SURE IN THE STATE HOUSE BY ONE VOTE, BY THE SLIMMEST OF MARGINS, NORTH CAROLINA DEMOCRATS WERE ABLE TO HOLD A LINER. THAT IS WHY IF WE SAY YOU HAVE TO WATCH EVERY RACE, YOU REALLY DO MEAN EVERY RACE.  I WANT TO TALK ABOUT MICHIGAN FOR A SECOND, BECAUSE LAST NIGHT, THE FIRST THING HAPPENED. I THINK VOTERS EARLY COUNT HAS A WEIRD EFFECT ON ELECTION NIGHT.  IT'S LIKE A JOKE. IT  COMES BACK EARLY, WE GET RESULTS EARLY, AND IT'S BEEN TURNING REPUBLICAN. LAST NIGHT, IF THERE WAS A FLORIDA AT THE DEMOCRATS -- IF THERE IS A GOVERNOR LIKE RON DESANTIS FOR DEMOCRATS IN TERMS OF -- ITS GRETCHEN WHITMER. THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE INTO, NOT JUST WHITMER. THIS IS A TIGHT STATE. THIS IS A SWING STATE. WHITMER WINS BY TEN, 11 POINTS, IT LOOKS LIKE. THEY SWING THE STATEWIDE OFFICES, THEY WIN BOTH HOUSES. THIS IS A GOVERNOR IN GRETCHEN WHITMER THAT WAS TARGETED BY THE RIGHT FROM DAY ONE. SHE HAD DONALD TRUMP LOOKING AT HER. SHE HAD A PLOT BUSTED BY THE FBI TO LITERALLY KIDNAP OR. THEY HAD ARMED PEOPLE SHOWING UP AT THE STATE HOUSE, AT HER HOUSE, AND SHE STUCK TO HER GUNS. SHE NEVER LOST SIGHT OF WHERE THE ELECTORATE WAS. SHE HAS COVERED AND A PROGRESSIVE FASHIONED HAS ALSO BEEN A BROADLY APPEALING FIGURE DESPITE HOW THEY TRIED TO PULL OURS ARE. I JUST THINK THE PERFORMANCE FOR MICHIGAN DEMOCRATS AND WHITMER IN PARTICULAR LAST NIGHT, SECURING THE TRIFECTA, WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE.  THANK YOU FOR SAYING THAT. WE SAID THIS IN THE COURT TODAY, FOR THE SHOW, THAT I AGREE WITH YOU, SHE HAS BEEN ECLIPSE. THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS AT THIS, BUT I CONSIDER HER THE BIG WINNER LAST NIGHT. SHE NOW SHOULD BE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL CONVERSATION, IF BIDEN DOES NOT RUN. BIG GROUCH, AS THEY CALL HER DOWN THERE. -- SHE'S EMERGED AS A POPULAR GOVERNOR, AS A WOMAN, AS SOMEBODY WHO I THINK SHOULD BE NATIONAL FIGURE. MUCH MORE IN THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE GENERALLY -- WE'REAS SOMEONE WHO'S RECENTLYG PLAYING A ROLE IN NATIONAL POLITICS, WHAT IS THE VIEW OF DEMOCRATS RUNNING THE TABLE IN A STATE LIKE MICHIGAN? WHAT IS THE VIEW OF THE IMPORTANCE, NOT JUST OF THE POLICY STUFF THEY CAN HAPPEN WITH THOSE LEGISLATIVE CONTROLS, BUT WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF POLITICS.  INVESTMENT IS KEY HERE, AND YOU CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE THE EFFECT, THE NUMBER OF, EVENTS THESE T-SHIRTS, SHE WORE A NOVEMBER T-SHIRT. SHE WAS A GOVERNOR THAT PLANNED ON THE ISSUE OF ABORTION, AND THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY SPEND OVER $20 MILLION ON ABORTION THE CYCLE, WHICH MADE A DIFFERENCE. I ALSO THINK THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATIVE CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE, WHICH IS USUALLY GETTING NO MONEY, AND THEY DIDN'T GET ANY THIS CYCLE FROM THE DNC, EVEN THOUGH THAT THEY GOT MONEY ELSEWHERE. THEY DON'T GET IT FROM THE DNC, BUT THEY RAISE THEIR OWN FUNDS, THEY WERE FACING HEADWINDS, IN COLORADO, MAINE, VERMONT, YOU NAME IT. THEY HELD THE LINE, AND THAT'S IN A TESTAMENT TO THE LASER FOCUS OF HER TEAM ON THE STATE SIDE.  AND JUST TO THAT POINT IN MICHIGAN SPECIFICALLY, THERE IS A BALLOT MEASURE ON ABORTION, WHICH WAS TO IN SHRINE ABORTION RIGHTS IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION WHILE DEMOCRATS REIGN THE TABLE IN MICHIGAN, THAT ABORTION MEASURE ALSO WENT IN A LANDSLIDE, 14 POINTS.  WE ALSO NEED TO NOTE AND UNDERSTAND AT THE BIG PICTURE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AFTER 2010, REPUBLICAN SET THEIR SIGHTS ON STATE LEGISLATURES. THEY FOCUSED ON DOWN BALLOT RACES, AND UNDERSTAND THAT STATES ARE THE LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY. WE ARE FINALLY AT THE POINT WHERE DEMOCRATS EQUALLY UNDERSTAND THAT MESSAGE, AND THEY'RE REALLY COVER STORIES ABOUT WISCONSIN BEING A SUPER MAJORITY IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE. WE ARE NOW ALL VERY AWOKE TO THIS. VOTERS UNDERSTAND IT IN A WAY THAT THEY HAVE TO.  I THINK IT'S TALKED ABOUT THE MISSION MEDIA, AND AT SOME POINT --  DEMOCRATIC PARTY OPERATIVE HAS TO COME UP AND FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO MORE THAN JUST TALK ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE TO GET MONEY, INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND IT. YOU HAVE TO NOT KNOW SPECIFICALLY.  BY THE, WAY IRONICALLY, THE REPUBLICANS DO THINGS LIKE CULTURE WAR OVER CRITICAL RACE THEORY, OR WHETHER KIDS BE TAUGHT ABOUT LGBT IN SCHOOL. ALL OF THAT CULTURE WHERE STUFF IS HYPER FOCUSED FOR A LOT OF DEMOCRATS IN STATES, AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO GO ALL THE WAY DOWN THE BALLOT. AND HONESTLY, TO COME BACK TO ROW, WE REALLY CAME TO AND UNDERSTAND THIS SIMPLE LESSON THAT NOW YOUR STATE ESSENTIALLY CONTROLS WHETHER YOU HAVE FREEDOM, WHETHER YOU HAVE -- DEPENDING ON WHO RUNS YOUR STATE, THAT MEANS YOU'RE, YOUR CHIEF LAWMAKERS IN YOUR OFFICE, THE PROSECUTORS IN YOUR OFFICE, IT GOES TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE REPRESENTATIVES. YOU NEED TO CONTROL WHO IS THERE.  TOTAL CONTROL IN WASHINGTON.  WHEN I THINK --  THE CONSTITUTIONAL THING THAT HAPPEN IN CALIFORNIA, IT MADE A DIFFERENCE.  THE LAST POINT WE WASTE IN WISCONSIN, HE'S GOING TO WIN THAT RACE BY ABOUT TWO AND A HALF POINTS. THE STATE VOTED FOR THE DEMOCRATIC COMMITTEE BY ABOUT TWO AND A HALF POINTS. THEY ALMOST GOT SUPER MAJORITY OF BOTH HOUSES, THINK ABOUT THAT GERRYMANDERING. THERE WERE TWO --  BUT THEY DIDN'T.  THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR --  THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN CAME OUT AND SAY, WHO DO WE WANT TO GOVERN THIS STATE? BY TWO POINTS, THE PEOPLE IN WISCONSIN SAID THAT WE WOULD LIKE THE DEMOCRAT TO GOVERNORS STATE. WHEN THOSE VOTES WERE FED INTO THE MAPS, THE REPUBLICANS THEMSELVES HAD WRITTEN, WHEN IT'S BAD OUT WAS NEAR SUPER MAJORITIES IN BOTH THE HOUSE AND SENATE. FOR THE REPUBLICANS WITH THE SAME VOTES, IT GOT TONY EVER'S ELECTED BY A SLIGHT MARGIN.  WE HAVE RAISED -- IT IS THE MOST GERRYMANDERED STATE OF EVER SEEN.  IN STATES WHERE THE GERRYMANDERING PROCESS HAS BEEN UNDONE SO THAT IT DOES NOT ADVANTAGE EITHER PARTY, THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED MICHIGAN.  DEMOCRATS RUNNING THE TABLE WITH FUND GERRYMANDERING. IT TURNED OUT THE PEOPLE IN MICHIGAN WANTED DEMOCRATS. AND WHEN ASKED TO DO SO IN A FAIR PROCESS, A TRANSPARENT, NONPARTISAN PROCESS, THAT WAS THE RESULT. THAT'S WHAT REPUBLICANS WERE SO AFRAID OF WHEN IT COMES TO GIVING UP ON GERRYMANDERING. NOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING DEFINITIVE TO TELL, YOU BUT I DO HAVE TO TELL YOU A BUNCH OF VOTES THAT JUST CAME IN. YOU SEE HOW STEVE IS HUNCHED OVER, HE IS RECEIVING NUMBERS.  HOW MUCH WE LOVE THE KORNACKI CAMP?  THE TAIL FEATHERS GO UP LIKE THAT. YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO POP OUT, HE'S GONNA GIVE YOU THAT INFORMATION.  AND SO ANY SECOND NOW WE'RE GOING TO SEE THIS POPULATION IN THE BORDER, YOU CERTAINLY SHOULD. BUT THIS MARICOPA COUNTY END|20221110015955|2022-11-10_0100_US_MSNBC_All_In_With_Chris_Hayes ",

        "trs": "> AND WOMEN THEY'RE VOTING AND THEY'RE PRIMARILY VOTING BECAUSE OF ROE BEING OVERTURNED, AND I THINK A LOT OF THEM ARE GOING TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES THAT SUPPORT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE BECAUSE ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE.  VOTERS SPENT A MIGHTY REBUKE TO JUSTICE ALETO AND HIS SENATE ACCOMPLICES SENDING THE MESSAGE LOUD AND CLEAR THAT CHOICE AND FREEDOM WILL NOT GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT. ABORTION WAS ON THE BALLOT IN FIVE STATES WHERE VOTERS SAID A RESOUNDING NO TO REPUBLICAN'S HANDMADES TALE FANTASIES OF MAKING THE GILLIAD REAL. IN KENTUCKY VOTERS DENIED -- CALIFORNIA, VERMONT AND BATTLEGROUND MICHIGAN ENSHRINED ABORTION RIGHTS IN THEIR STATE CONSTITUTIONS WHILE IN MONTANA VOTERS WERE ASKED WHETHER TO REQUIRE MEDICAL CARE FOR INFANTS BORN ALIVE AFTER AN ATTEMPTED ABORTION EVEN THOUGH THAT'S NOT HOW ABORTION WORKS AND NOT A THING THAT EVER HAPPENS. NBC NEWS PROJECTS THE REFERENDUM WILL NOT PASS. JOINING ME NOW DEMOCRATIC POLITICAL STRATEGIST AND CEO OF TARGET SMART, AND THE PRESIDENT OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD. I'M GOING TO HAVE TOM PAUSE ON YELLING I TOLD YOU SO FOR THE NEXT SIX MINUTES, AND I'M GOING TO GO TO YOU FIRST, ALEXIS. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR THE PROTECTION OF ABORTION RIGHTS, LAST NIGHT'S VOTE?  LOOK, WE TOLD YOU SO, TOO.  YOU DID.  WE DID. WE TOLD YOU THAT WHEN ABORTION WAS ON THE BALLOT PEOPLE WILL VOTE FOR FREEDOM, AND THAT'S WHAT WE SAW AGAIN AND AGAIN NOT ONLY THE BALLOT MEASURES BUT ALSO WE RECOGNIZE ABORTION ALSO MADE THESE MID-TERMS MORE COMPETITIVE. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY COMPETITIVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS A COLLECTIVE OF MOVEMENT LEADERS MAKING THIS CASE. AND EVERYWHERE WE WENT WE SAW THE ENERGY, WE HEARD THE STORIES. WE KNEW THAT PEOPLE WERE GOING TO SHOW UP BECAUSE THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME OTHER THAN KANSAS THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY DEMONSTRATE THEIR OUTRAGE, THEIR FRUSTRATION, QUITE FRANKLY THEIR BETRAYAL FROM THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNING ROE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT.  YEAH, AND TOM, YOU SAW SOMETHING IN THE DATA NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE I GUESS SAW OR DIDN'T WANT TO SEE. CAN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT. BECAUSE YOU WERE ON OUR SHOW A FEW TIMES AND SAID NOTHING HAS CHANGED, THE DATA HASN'T CHANGED OVER TIME. WHAT WERE YOU SEEING IN THE DATA SOME OF THE POLLING AVERAGES WERE MISSING?  YEAH, JOY, I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY MISSED IT. YOU HAVE BEEN REPORTING ON THIS FROM THE BEGINNING BUT GOING BACK TO THE DOBBS DECISION. JUST ALETO HAS SAID IF THEY DON'T LIKE THIS THEY SHOULD VOTE. YOU SAW IT IN KANSAS AS YOU REPORTED, SURGES, WOMEN REGISTERING AT RECORD SETTING RATES, BIG GENDER GAPS. AND THEN WE SAW IN THE EARLY VOTE, AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE PLACE WE WEREN'T SEEING IT, THESE ABSURD POLLS THAT WERE SUGGESTING SOMEHOW WOMEN HAD FORGOTTEN WHEN IN THE END THE DATA WAS SHOWING OTHERWISE AND FRANKLY AND NOT COINCIDENTLY THE STATES WHERE WE SAW THE BIGGEST GENDER GAPS IN REGISTRATION, THE STATES WHERE DEMOCRATS HAVE HAD THE BIGGEST VICTORIES. WE TALK ABOUT MICHIGAN AND PENNSYLVANIA, THOSE ARE TWO BIG ONES.  WELL, YOU AND SIMON ROSENBERG WE HAD YOU GUYS ON AND WE WERE PING-PONGING THE TWO OF YOU BECAUSE YOU WERE SAYING THE SAME THINGS AND I FOUND IT INTERESTING. ALEXIS, ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT LAST NIGHT A POINT NICOLLE WALLACE MADE I THINK IS REALLY SMART IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU CAN'T SEE IN POLLS IS WHEN WOMEN ARE DELETING THE APP THEY USE TO THE WATCH THEIR PERIODS, AND I KNOW A LOT OF WOMEN WHO ARE ARE DOING THAT. YOU DON'T SEE IT IN THE POLLS IF WOMEN ARE HESITATING ON ENCOURAGING THEIR DAUGHTERS TO GO TO SCHOOL IN TEXAS, TO GO TO COLLEGE IN TEXAS OR, YOU KNOW, SOUTH CAROLINA BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED IF THEY'RE IN A STATE LIKE GEORGIA, THESE STATES WITH THESE MASS ABORTION BANS AND GOD FORBID SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THEM, THEY WILL THEN BE TRAPPED OR PREGNANT WOMEN THINKING I WILL MOVE OUT OF TEXAS. THAT'S THE KIND OF STUFF NOT POLLABLE. GIVE SOME ADVICE TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO THESE DATA KIND OF BEFORE THESE ELECTIONS. HOW CAN THEY BE TALKING TO WOMEN DIFFERENTLY SO THEY UNDERSTAND THE ISSUES THAT ARE IMPORTANT?  YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS WE SAW ON THE GROUND IN MICHIGAN IN PARTICULAR WHEN WE WENT AND SAT IN ROUND TABLES OF, YOU KNOW, IN DETROIT AND SUBURBAN INDEPENDENT LARGELY REPUBLICAN COMMUNITIES WAS HOW CONSISTENT THE FEAR AND THE STORIES WERE THAT PEOPLE WERE EXPRESSING, YOU KNOW, THEIR PREGNANCIES HAD ALL BEEN DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE AS THEY ALL ARE. AND THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY WENT BACK TO 1931 LAW AND THE STORIES THAT WERE COMING OUT OF TEXAS WHERE PATIENTS WERE LITERALLY BEING SENT ALMOST INTO SEPSIS IN ORDER TO GET ABORTION CARE. SO ALL OF THOSE STORIES I THINK HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY REAL. WHAT WE SAW YESTERDAY, JOY, THERE WAS A STORY OF A YOUNG MICHIGAN WOMAN WHO LITERALLY VOTED ON HER HOSPITAL BED WHEN SHE WAS 8 SENT METERS DILATED BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO MAKE SURE HER VOICE WAS HEARD. SHE WANTED TO GET HER VOTE IN FOR GOVERNOR WHITMER AND PROPOSITION 3. IT WAS JUST THAT IMPORTANT. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT WE DON'T SEE THAT IN THE POLLING, AND I THINK WE DEFIED THE POLLS AND THERE'S TIME TO SIT DOWN WITH PEOPLE.  YOU KNOW, TOM, TARGET SMART DOES A REALLY GREAT JOB AT ACCUMULATING DATA AND OBVIOUSLY YOU GUYS ARE GOOD AT CHOOSING SAMPLES. BUT HOW GOING FORWARD DO YOU -- ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT LOOKING AT THE STATES THAT DID NOT VOTE IN FAVOR OF FREEDOM? I MEAN I THINK ABOUT NORTH CAROLINA WHERE TED BUDD WHO WILL BE THE NEW UNITED STATES SENATOR IS A COSPONSOR OF A NATIONAL ABORTION BAN. YOU HAVE IN SOUTH CAROLINA LINDSEY GRAHAM, THE SPONSOR OF A NATIONAL ABORTION BAN. THIS ISN'T GOING TO END AND WE'RE GOING TO START -- YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE LOCAL NEWS A LOT OF WOMEN IN THESE SOUTHERN STATES HAVE A SOLID ANTI-ABORTION SOUTH IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT'S GOING TO MEAN A LOT OF WOMEN IN THAT REGION ARE GOING TO DIE OR GET REAL SICK OR HAVE REAL PROBLEMS. HOW DO YOU PLAN TO GO FORWARD IN TERMS OF MONITORING THAT KIND OF DATA ON WHAT THAT MEANS?  WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS THIS FALSE DICHOTOMY PUSHED FROM THE POLLS AS IF VOTERS WERE GOING TO BE CONCERNED ONLY ABOUT THE ECONOMY OR CHOICE. AND THE RESULTS WE'VE SEEN AND THE ISSUES THAT PUT THIS IN THE FOREFRONT AND THESE BALLOT INITIATIVES AGAIN WE SEE THE BIGGEST OVERPERFORMANCE. SO I THINK THE LESSON HERE IS NOT THAT DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGNS SHOULD BE RUNNING AWAY FROM THE ISSUE OR LEANING INTO THIS. AND DO BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE OF THAT. AND REMEMBER IN KANSAS A MAJORITY OF THE VOTERS WHO VOTED IN KANSAS THAT 18-POINT PRO-CHOICE MARGIN WERE REPUBLICANS. 52% OF THEM WERE REGISTERED REPUBLICANS. THERE IS A PROL-CHOICE MAJORITY ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT'S THE DATA WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT, MAMODELING THOSE VOTERS. FINDING THOSE COMMON SENSE REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO CROSS OVER AND VOTE PRO-CHOICE.  YOU KNOW, ALEXIS, IT WAS KIND OF FRIGHTENING. I FELT WHEN I WAS IN TEXAS BEFORE THE ELECTION IN FORT WORTH WHEN I LEFT IT REALLY HIT ME THERE ARE FREE STATES AND LOOMING SLAVE STATES NOW. THOSE OF US WHO ARE MODERN AND THINK WOMEN SHOULD HAVE RIGHTS OVER OUR BODIES IT'S EASY TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED SO MANY OF OUR SISTERS IN THE SOUTH OR MISSOURI OR SO MANY OF THESE OTHER PLACES THEY'RE IN TROUBLE. WHAT DO WE DO?  YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AND I THINK THAT IS THE CONTRAST WE WERE ABLE TO DRAW SO CLEARLY DURING THIS ELECTION CYCLE, RIGHT, TO BE ABLE TO -- NOT ONLY WERE MANY OF THESE 18 STATES ALSO BANNING ACCESS TO ABORTION SO QUICKLY POST-DOBBS THEY'VE ALSO INTRODUCED OTHER EXTREME MEASURES LIKE, YOU KNOW, RIGHT TO TRAVEL ACROSS STATE BOUNDARIES. SO LITERALLY SAYING A STATE COULD HOLD YOU HOSTAGE IN YOUR STATE SO THAT YOU COULDN'T GET THE HEALTH CARE YOU NEED. AND I THINK THAT ACTUALLY MADE THE DIFFERENCE. SO EVEN IN A STATE WHEREAS HEART BREAKING AS A LOSS IN NORTH CAROLINA TO NOT HAVE SHERYL BEASLEY COMING INTO THE SENATE, I DO THINK HER ABILITY TO RAISE THIS ISSUE AND HAVE THE CONVERSATION IS WHAT MADE THE RACE AS CLOSE AS IT WAS AND MADE IT COMPETITIVE, AND I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE AND TRAU THIS CONTRAST WITH THESE CANDIDATES WHO HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THEY'RE GOING TO SIGN-UP FOR A NATIONAL BAN AND DO THINGS EVEN MORE EXTREME.  I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS DEMOCRATS ARE A GOOD POSITION TO HOLD THE SENATE. A LOT OF DEMOCRATS WOKE UP AND SAID YOU WANT TO PUT THEM IN THE SENATE AND DON'T THOING THEY'RE NOT COMING FOR CONTRACEPTION, TOO, BECAUSE THEY ALREADY SAID THEY ARE. > UP NEXT, VOTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA THEY SAID NO TO CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM AND TO TRUMP'S HAND PICKED CROSSWALK TV DOCTOR.

        "trs": "> WE ARE BACK NOW HEADING UP HOUR TWO OF OUR SPECIAL ELECTION COVERAGE. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. I'M HAILLY JACKSON AT OUR ELECTION HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK WITH ANDREA MITCHELL AND KATY TUR. TOP OF THE HOUR, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND DEVELOPED IN THE LAST 60 MINUTES OR SO, RIGHT. BIG PICTURE HERE, HOUSE PROJECTION IS PRETTY MUCH WHERE IT'S BEEN FOR MOST OF THE MORNING HERE. KIND OF AN OPEN QUESTION. PLUS OR MINUS 10 SEATS WITH DOZENS OF RACES YET TO BE CALLED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. IN THE LAST 7 MINUTES WE SAW FROM OUR FRIEND OF THE SHOW JAKE SHERMAN, KEVIN McCARTHY ANNOUNCING HIS BID FOR THE SPEAKERSHIP. THE SENATE AS WE LOOK AT THAT BOARD, LISTEN, WE DON'T KNOW. SENATOR RON JOHNSON KEEPING REPUBLICANS IN THE RUNNING WITH MAYBE THE MAJORITY WITH THE PROJECTED WIN OVER MANDELA BARNES AND THEN THAT BIG NEWS IN THE LAST HOUR, THE GEORGIA RACE NOW ADVANCING TO A RUNOFF BETWEEN INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT RAPHAEL WARNOCK AND REPUBLICAN HERSCHEL WALKER AS WELL.  AND ARIZONA IS STILL TOO EARLY TO CALL WITH DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MARK KELLY HOLDING A LEAD OVER BLAKE MASTERS. IN NEVADA, A POTENTIAL BRIGHT SPOT FOR SENATE REPUBLICANS ADAM LAXALT IS LEADING INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO BUT THERE'S STILL A CHUNK LEFT TO BE COUNTED OUT THERE. THE BIG NEWS IN THE HOUSE, DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGN CHAIRMAN SEAN PATRICK MALONEY, HE CONCEDED HIS RACE IN A BIG PICK UP FOR REPUBLICANS.  AND THIS HOUR WE'LL ALSO HAVE REPORTS FROM KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES THAT HAVE BIG UNCALLED RACES. THE LATEST FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AHEAD OF PRESIDENT BIDEN'S REMARKS AT 4:00 THIS AFTERNOON, 4:00 EASTERN, AND WE WILL LOOK AHEAD TO A POTENTIAL 2020 PRIMARY MATCHUP BETWEEN FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AND FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DeSANTIS. A MATCHUP THAT'S ALREADY DIVIDING THE PARTY  LET'S GET INTO IT HERE. WE ARE JOINED BY OUR PANEL MICHAEL STEELE, FORMER RNC CHAIR, ROBERT GIBBS, FORMER MARYLAND CONGRESSWOMAN EDWARDS AND YOU USED TO WORK FOR KEVIN McCARTHY AS WELL, I THINK, WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT, MARIA, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF VOTE LATINO IS HERE AND NBC'S ELLISON BARBER ON THE GROUND IN GEORGIA FOR US. BRENDON, LET ME START WITH YOU, THE NEWS WE'RE GETTING IN, I DON'T SEE BRENDON, DO WE HAVE HIM.  THE GHOST OF BRENDON.  THERE HE IS.  OH, MAN, GANG, THIS IS REALLY GOING OFF THE RAILS. WE'RE STILL ON TRACK. THANK GOODNESS. THE NEWS IN THE LAST COUPLE MINUTES HERE, YOU KNOW, AS EXPECTED, KEVIN McCARTHY, NOW ACCORDING TO JAKE SHERMAN, ANNOUNCED HIS BID FOR THE HOUSE LEADERSHIP AND RIGHT BEFORE THE BREAK, SENATE MINORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL NOT DEALING IN FEELINGS, HE'S GOING TO SEE HOW THE VOTE COUNT COMES IN SEVERAL RACES STILL TO COME. TALK US THROUGH HOW YOU'RE SEEING THE LANDSCAPE AS IT STANDS JUST AFTER 1:00 EASTERN?  YEAH. THE DIVIDE IS NOT GREAT. A LOT OF FRUSTRATION A LOT OF ANXIETY A LOT OF SHOCK, FRANKLY. MEMBERS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WENT WRONG, THE CONFIDENCE THEY HAD, HOW IT SLIPPED AWAY. KEVIN McCARTHY DOESN'T HAVE ROOM TO SIT AROUND AND WAIT AND HE'S MOVING FORWARD. I GET WHY HE'S DOING IT. THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE LEADERSHIP ELECTIONS NEXT WEEK. IT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW IT GOES. A LEADERSHIP ELECTION INSIDE THE CONFERENCE DOESN'T MATTER A WHOLE LOT. HE NEEDS 50% OF HIS COLLEAGUES TO NOMINATE HIM TO BE SPEAKER, BUT ULTIMATELY HE HAS TO GET 218 VOTES ON THE HOUSE FLOOR IN JANUARY. HE COULD EASILY SLIDE THROUGH AN ELECTION INSIDE THE CONFERENCE, BUT TWO MONTHS FROM NOW, WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GO TO THE FLOOR, THAT'S AN ETERNITY. WHAT I WILL BE LOOKING FOR, ARE THERE THE FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBERS, FAR RIGHT OF THE CONFERENCE R THEY GOING TO TRY TO EXTORT ANYTHING OUT OF KEVIN McCARTHY FOR THEIR VOTE TO BE SPEAKER? I THINK HE HAS THE INSIDE TRACK TO BE THE NEXT SPEAKER. I THINK MEMBERS WANT HIM TO BE THE NEXT SPEAKER, BUT ONLY TAKES -- A MARGIN OF THREE OR FOUR OR FIVE SEATS IT ONLY TAKES THAT MANY FOLKS TO SAY I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE MY VOTE TO YOU UNLESS, WHAT THOSE ARE WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE OUT, BUT I EXPECT THERE WILL BE CONFLICT FROM NOW TO JANUARY WHEN THE REAL VOTE IS  I KNOW YOU HAD PAINFUL EXPERIENCE AT TIMES WORKING WITH SPEAKERS WHO WERE REALLY FRUSTRATED BY THE FREEDOM CAUCUS AND OTHERS AND HAS BECOME FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE AND THEIR EXTREME MEMBERS, MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE AND OTHERS THAT DIDN'T CROP UP AT THAT TIME. TALK ABOUT THE EFFECT OF DONALD TRUMP? BECAUSE HASN'T DONALD TRUMP BEEN DISCREDITED TO A CERTAIN DEGREE BY LAST NIGHT'S RESULTS? IT WAS McCARTHY'S EMBRACE OF DONALD TRUMP THAT BROUGHT HIM TO THIS LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE FIRST PLACE  SURE. IT GOES -- CUTS BOTH WAYS. OBVIOUSLY, KEVIN McCARTHY HAS HAD A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH DONALD TRUMP AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT STRENGTHENED HIM WITHIN THE CONFERENCE AND WHY KEVIN McCARTHY HAS BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THE FREEDOM CAUCUS AT BAY. I THINK WE ALL AGREE DONALD TRUMP HAS SOME BLAME TO TAKE FOR THIS ELECTION. HIS BRAND IS HURTING THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THE PARTY PROBLEM IS, WE'RE NOT A VERY INTROSPECTIVE PARTY. I DON'T THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF DEREFLEX AMONG REPUBLICANS RIGHT NOW. I'M SURE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED, BUT WHAT THEY WON'T SAY OUT LOUD IS THAT DONALD TRUMP WAS THE PROBLEM. UNTIL SOMEONE IS WILLING TO SAY IT OUT LOUD I DON'T THINK MUCH WILL STAY.  MICHAEL STEELE.  I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.  YOU SHOULD SEE THE FACES HE'S MAKING.  YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN MY FACE, YOU NAILED IT. THERE IS NO GEEZ, WHAT DO WE DO, HOW DID THIS HAPPEN? THAT'S NOT HOW WE LOOK AT THESE THINGS. IT'S COLD, CRITICAL CALCULATIONS THAT ARE MADE ALONG THE POLITICAL SCALE AND KEVIN McCARTHY IS RIGHT MAKING THE MOVE HE'S MAKING, IRRESPECTIVE OF WHERE THE VOTE IS IN THE HOUSE, IT'S SENDING A SIGNAL HE'S GOING TO PUT THINGS IN PLAY. HE WANTS TO PUT THINGS IN MOTION TO SET THE TABLE BEFORE IT'S SET BY MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE AND OTHERS. THE BACKSIDE OF THIS ARE TWO PIECES. ONE, IS DONALD TRUMP. I STILL DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A CLEAN, SMOOTH TRANSITION FOR KEVIN McCARTHY.  YOU THINK?  WHEN YOU GET TO LATE DECEMBER, EARLY JANUARY, DONALD TRUMP MAY HAVE A THING OR TWO TO SAY ABOUT WHO THE NEXT SPEAKER IS GOING TO BE.  IF PAST IS PRESS DEPARTMENT HE WILL USE SOCIAL MEDIA.  HOW MANY YEARS HAVE WE BEEN TALKING ABOUT KEVIN McCARTHY HOW HE WORKED WITH DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE. THIS IS LIKE FOR HIM, YEARS IN THE MAKING.  AND ALL THE ARROWS HE'S TAKEN.  ALL THE ARROWS. BUT THE SECOND PIECE IS, YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD SOME OF THE TELL FROM THE FREEDOM CAUCUS FOLKS WHO LIKE A JIM JORDAN OR SOMEONE ELSE, TO BRENDAN'S POINT HOW DO THEY LEVERAGE TO GET AND EXTRACT SOMETHING. KEEP IN MIND, WHEN WE HAD A MORE SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE, REPUBLICANS TOOK OUT NOT ONE, BUT TWO REPUBLICAN SPEAKERS IN PAUL RYAN AND JOHN BOEHNER.  I THINK HE REMEMBERS THAT.  YOU HAVE A NARROW MAJORITY HERE. THE POWER SHIFTS INSIDE THAT CAUCUS TREMENDOUSLY.  TO JAKE SHERMAN, CO-FOUNDER OF PUNCH BOWL NEWS AND MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR AND NO ONE BETTER TO ASK THIS QUESTION ABOUT KEVIN McCARTHY AND, PERHAPS, HIS NEXT VERY SLIM MAJORITY.  YEAH. GOD, I HAVE A LOT OF THOUGHTS. DO WE HAVE THE HOUR? I THINK --  WE HAVE A COUPLE HOURS.  THERE IS A LOT TO UNPACK HERE. NUMBER ONE, THE QUESTION I TOLD THIS TO KATY EARLIER WHEN WE SPOKE NOT ON TELEVISION, BUT THE QUESTION ISN'T WHETHER KEVIN McCARTHY IS ABLE TO BECOME THE SPEAKER. THERE ARE -- THE HOUSE IS AN INSTITUTION IN WHICH THERE IS TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LEEWAY TO DO THINGS TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT DOES HE HAVE TO GIVE UP TO BECOME SPEAKER? JOHN BOEHNER AND PAUL RYAN, BOTH WHO BRENDON WORKED FOR BOTH OF THOSE MEN, HAVE HAD TO GO THROUGH THIS AT VARIOUS TIMES IN THEIR CAREER AS WELL. THE DEMANDS THAT RIGHT IS PUTTING ON KEVIN McCARTHY ARE RIDICULOUS AND HE SHOULD -- HE WOULD BE CRAZY TO ACCEPT THEM. WHY WOULD HE BE CRAZY? BECAUSE ONCE HE STARTS GIVING IN TO THE RIGHT ON ANY ISSUE HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO GIVE IN TO THEM ON EVERY ISSUE AND IT'S NOT A PRECEDENCE HE WANTS TO SET. I SPOKE TO HIM THIS FALL WHEN HE THOUGHT HE WOULD WIN 25 TO 30 SEATS AND SAID I DON'T DEAL WELL WITH LEVERAGE. I AGREE WITH BRENDAN. HE HAS THE INSIDE TRACK, BUT IT IS AN ETERNITY UNTIL JANUARY AND I THINK HE WILL BECOME SPEAKER. JIM JORDAN CANNOT GET 218 VOTES, I DON'T THINK, NOR DOES HE WANT TO. I DON'T KNOW HOW McCARTHY IS GOING TO GET THERE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T THINK HE WILL. HE WILL. IT'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY BUMPY AND THERE ARE JUST TONS OF SPEED BUMPS IN THE WAY BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY 3rd.  THERE'S ALSO A QUESTION OF HOW DO YOU RUN THAT CONFERENCE WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU'VE GOT TO TRY TO WIN AGAIN IN '24 AND WHAT DO YOU GO AFTER AND PURSUE AND HOW MUCH GRIDLOCK DO YOU ALLOW THAT MIGHT END UP HURTING YOU AND WHAT SORT OF, I DON'T KNOW, HEARINGS YOU MIGHT ALLOW JIM JORDAN TO CONDUCT? I WANT TO ASK YOU A CURVEBALL ABOUT GEORGIA. SAY IT COMES DOWN TO GEORGIA, CONTROL OF THE SENATE, WHICH IT LIKELY COULD AND THERE'S A MONTH NOW BEFORE WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS IN THAT RUNOFF, HOW DOES A LAME DUCK CONGRESS FUNCTION WITH THAT HANGING OVER ITS HEAD?  THIS IS JUST THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION, KATY, THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US IN WASHINGTON FOR THE NEXT EIGHT OR SO WEEKS. BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT RUNS OUT OF MONEY ON DECEMBER 16th. THE GEORGIA RUNOFF IS RIGHT THEN. YOU HAVE A MATTER OF DAYS TO FUND THE GOVERNMENT, POTENTIALLY RAISE THE DEBT LIMIT AND DO A HOST OF SERIOUS HEAVY LIFT LEGISLATING WITH VERY LITTLE TIME ON THE CLOCK AND FURTHERMORE, THESE DEALS ARE TYPICALLY CONDUCTED BETWEEN THE FOUR CORNERS, THE SPEAKER, MINORITY LEADER, SENATE MAJORITY LEADER SENATE MINORITY LEADER. THERE IS NO CHANCE, I THINK BRENDAN WOULD AGREE WITH ME, VIRTUALLY NO CHANCE KEVIN McCARTHY COULD BE PART OF ANY OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS EVEN IF HE SUPPORTS THEM. NO WAY. BECAUSE HIS CONFERENCE IS GOING TO BE VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED. THIS PUTS JUST A MASSIVE, MASSIVE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE ON THE REST OF THE INSTITUTION GOING INTO THE END OF THIS YEAR.  JAKE SHERMAN, THANKS SO MUCH. ALL OVER THIS LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE AND CONGRESS, OF COURSE. THANK YOU. > I WANT TO BRING IN NBC'S CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT KRISTEN WELKER OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. SO, KRISTEN, GEORGIA, YOU COVERED HERSCHEL WALKER AND INTERVIEW HIM IN HIS HOMETOWN. WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON HOW THIS RUNOFF WILL SHAPE UP?  WELL, ANDREA, FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THAT ALL SIDES WERE ANTICIPATING THIS. I JUST HEARD FROM SOMEONE WITHIN THE WALKER CAMPAIGN WHO SAID THAT AS SOON AS THIS SEEMED TO BE WHERE THINGS WERE HEADING OVERNIGHT, THAT THEY STARTED TO LAUNCH THE RUNOFF CAMPAIGN. SO ALL SIDES WERE BRACING FOR THIS. THIS IS A SENIOR BIDEN AIDE WHO SAID THIS, THIS IS WHAT WE EXPECTED. WE ARE FEELING UPBEAT, A RUNOFF WITHOUT BRIAN KEMP ON THE TICKET HELPING WALKER IS A GREAT SHOT FOR WARNOCK. THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT CONTROL OF THE SENATE COULD COME DOWN TO GEORGIA, AS IT DID TWO YEARS AGO, SO THIS IS CERTAINLY FAMILIAR TERRAIN FOR ALL SIDES. THE QUESTION I THINK, ANDREA, THAT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING, WILL WE SEE PRESIDENT BIDEN CAMPAIGN FOR SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK? HE WAS NOT THERE DURING THE FIRST PART OF THIS RACE, AND, OF COURSE, YOU SAW WARNOCK KIND OF TRYING TO DISTANCE HIMSELF. WHAT WE SAW OVERNIGHT WERE SOME VICTORIES FOR SOME CANDIDATES WHO EMBRACED PRESIDENT BIDEN, INCLUDING JOHN FETTERMAN, WHO, OF COURSE, WAS LOCKED IN THAT VERY TOUGH RACE IN PENNSYLVANIA. THAT REMAINS AN OPEN QUESTION, AS WE'VE BEEN REPORTING, THOUGH, PRESIDENT BIDEN IS EXPECTED TO SPEAK TODAY IN JUST A FEW HOURS FROM NOW AND EXPECTED TO TAKE QUESTIONS AS WELL. THOSE WILL BE I THINK AMONG THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING TO GET ANSWERS TO. THEN MORE BRADLEY SPEAKING, ANDREA, THE WHITE HOUSE REALLY RELIEVE, FEELING SOMEWHAT EMBOLDENED TODAY BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID THERE WOULD BE THE RED WAVE THAT DID NOT MATERIALIZE, BUT THE QUESTION BECOMES WHERE CAN THEY FIND COMMON GROUND WITH REPUBLICANS IF, IN FACT, REPUBLICANS DO TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? HOW WILL THEY RESPOND TO THOSE INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE POTENTIALLY LOOMING? WE ARE TOLD THAT PRESIDENT WILL TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE OF ABORTION, THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT, IN THESE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. SO A LOT AT STAKE WHEN WE EXPECT TO HEAR FROM PRESIDENT BIDEN IN JUST A FEW HOURS FROM NOW.  AND KRISTEN, 2024 IS ALREADY HAPPENING, EVEN THOUGH IT'S 2022. YOU KNOW, DON'T EVERYBODY YELL AT ONCE. BECAUSE OF DONALD TRUMP'S, YOU KNOW, ANTICIPATED ANNOUNCEMENT AND RON DeSANTIS' HUGELY SUCCESSFUL FLORIDA VICTIM AND THE RIVALRY BREWING ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE AND NOW WHAT DOES PRESIDENT BIDEN DO? HOW DOES HE CALCULATE IT?  TWO-THIRDS OF THOSE IN THE EXIT POLLS DID NOT WANT HIM TO SEEK RE-ELECTION AND THAT -- YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A REJECTION OF HIS POLICIES OVERALL AND PEOPLE THINKING THAT HIS POLICIES ARE TAKING US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION? HOW DOES HE FRAME THIS DECISION?  THAT IS GOING TO BE THE KEY QUESTION, ANDREA, AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE STAGGERING AND THAT PRESIDENT HAS TO BE TAKING A HARD LOOK AT THAT. I SPOKE WITH ONE OF HIS TOP ADVUZERS WHO SAID LOOK, HE'S ALWAYS SAID HE INTENDS TO RUN FOR RE-ELECTION. THAT HAS NOT CHANGED AS OF TODAY AND YET HE HAS NOT MADE A FINAL DECISION. HE WILL HUDDLE WITH FAMILY MEMBERS TO REACH THE FINAL DECISION ULTIMATELY. THE PRESSURE IS GOING TO BE ON HIM TO MAKE THAT FINAL DECISION BECAUSE IF HE DECIDES TO BOW OUT, AT THIS POINT IN TIME NO SIGNS HE WILL DO THAT, HE WILL WANT TO MAKE WAY FOR SOMEONE ELSE. THAT, OF COURSE, ON THE TABLE AS WELL TODAY AS WE PREPARE TO ADDRESS THE PRESIDENT IN JUST A FEW HOURS FROM NOW.  KRISTEN WELKER, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. > I WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT SOMETHING WE SAW IN THE NBC NEWS EXIT POLLS, IT SHOWED THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SEE JOE BIDEN RUN FOR PRESIDENT AGAIN OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF PEOPLE SAID NO. YOU LOOKED IN THE CROSS TABS, WHAT DO YOU DO IF YOU'RE THE WHITE HOUSE?  WELL TWO THINGS. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK, AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS, KROTSS TABS. 83% OF DEMOCRATS SAY THEY DO WANT TO SEE A BIDEN RUN. I THINK WHAT THAT DOES IS GIVES HIM THE POLITICAL SPACE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE A PERSONAL DECISION. YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT KRISTEN SAID, WHAT WE'VE HEARD, EVEN JOE BIDEN SAYING IN INTERVIEWS HE INTENDS TO RUN. EVERY PRESIDENT INTENDS TO RUN. NOW THEY HAVE TO MAKE THIS INTENTIONALLY PERSONAL DECISION ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A MEETING THERE. WE'LL SEE WHAT THE FAMILY DECIDES, WE'LL SEE WHEN THEY SET UP A LEGAL APPARATUS, WHEN DO THEY START HIRING PEOPLE. I THINK THE THIS NUMBER IN THE EXIT POLL GIVES THEM A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE TO MAKE THAT DECISION.  DOES IT MATTER IF IT'S TRUMP RUNNING OR IF IT'S DeSANTIS RUNNING? DOES THAT MAKE THE DECISION FOR HIM?  PROBABLY HARD, GIVEN WHAT I THINK THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY WILL BE LIKE, TO UNDERSTAND WHO THAT PERSON IS GOING TO BE WHEN HE HAS TO MAKE HA DECISION. I THINK THE THE ONE THING JOE BIDEN CAN TAKE OUT OF THIS EXIT POLL OF ALL VOTERS IS, I'M -- I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER IN FRONT OF ME, BUT MY GUESS IS THAT NUMBER IS LOWER FOR PEOPLE THAT WANT TO SEE DONALD TRUMP RUN. IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT THINKING IF GET THE NOMINATION I'M A 50/50 SHOT, RIGHT. IF I'M RUNNING AGAINST TRUMP I'M PROBABLY BETTER THAN A 50/50 SHOT. THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO ANIMATE PART OF THAT DECISION MAKING. ONE OF THE THINGS, IT'S A VERY EASY DECISION ABOUT WHETHER HE GOES TO GEORGIA OR NOT. YOU ASK THE WARNOCK CAMPAIGN, AM I HELPFUL, IF THE ANSWER IS YES, YOU GAS UP. IF THE ANSWER IS NO, YOU CALL BARACK OBAMA AND BILL CLINTON OR SOMEBODY ELSE AND -- LOOK, I REMEMBER BEING IN THE WHITE HOUSE WHEN WE HAD TO MAKE SOME OF THESE DECISIONS AND HAD TO TALK ABOUT THEM. I'M HAPPY TO TAKE A COUPLE BAD QUESTIONS IN THE BRIEFING ROOM WHY MY BOSS ISN'T GOING GO AND THEN SIX WEEKS LATER WIN THAT RACE. THAT'S FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SPIN OF THAT DAY.  ON GEORGIA LET'S GO TO ELLISON BARBER TO GIVE US THE VIEW ON THE GROUND IN GEORGIA. SHE IS JOINING US NOW. TALK TO US ABOUT THE LAST HOUR AND A HALF OR SO, NOT EVEN, SINCE WE'VE SEEN THE PROJECTION FOR THE GEORGIA RUNOFF. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING?  YEAH. A LOT CHANGING, A LOT VERY QUICKLY CHANGING, BUT NOT UNEXPECTED BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE POLLING. KRISTEN WELKER REPORTING HERSCHEL WALKER'S CAMPAIGN HAVE TOLD HER, THEY HAVE TOLD US IN THE PAST THEY VERY MUCH KNEW THIS COULD BE A POSSIBILITY, SO DID WARNOCK'S CAMPAIGN, BUT IT WAS A POSSIBILITY BOTH CAMPAIGNS WERE HOPING THEY COULD AVOID. WE DO EXPECT TO HEAR FROM GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE ON THE ELECTION RESULTS IN ABOUT AN HOUR. THIS MORNING WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THE TWO CAMPAIGN MANAGERS GOING BACK AND FORTH ON TWITTER WITH WARNOCK'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER TWEETING AT HERSCHEL WALKER HE UNDER PERFORMED TRUMP'S VOTE SHARE IN RURAL SUBURBAN AND URBAN COUNTIES. HE ENDED UP CALLING LAST NIGHT A GOOD NIGHT FOR HIS CANDIDATE, INCUMBENT SENATOR WARNOCK AND BAD ONE FOR WALKER. WALKER'S CAMPAIGN MANAGER REPLYING SAYING 50% VOTED AGAINST THE INCUMBENT THAT SPEND MORE THAN $100 MILLION. THIS HAS BEEN A FASCINATING RACE. YOU HAD TWO CANDIDATES WHO HAD VERY WELL LIKABILITY, NAME RECOGNITION IN THE STATE. HERSCHEL WALKER BECAUSE HE IS A LEGENDARY FOOTBALL PLAYER IN THE STATE. SENATOR WARNOCK, SOMEONE WELL-KNOWN, GIVEN HIS POSITION AT EBENEZER BAPTIST CHURCH AND ALSO WELL LIKED. I THINK BACK TO ONE OF THE VERY FIRST CAMPAIGN ADS WE SAW HERE FROM NATIONAL REPUBLICANS THAT ESSENTIALLY STARTED BY SAYING, HEY, WE KNOW THAT YOU THINK SENATOR WARNOCK IS A GOOD GUY, BUT HE VOTES WITH PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN X AMOUNT OF TIME. WE STARTED WHERE BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES HAD HIGH NAME RECOGNITION, BOTH RELATIVELY WELL LIKED AS PEOPLE. THEN WE SAW THIS RACE JUST GET MORE AND MORE INTENSE, MORE AND MORE MESSY. YOU HAD A LOT OF ALLEGATIONS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT REPUBLICAN HERSCHEL WALKER'S PERSONAL LIFE IN THIS RACE. HE WAS ACCUSED BY TWO WOMEN OF PAYING FOR AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO HAVE AN ABORTION. HE IS A STAUNCH ANTI-ABORTION CANDIDATE. HE DENIED THOSE ALLEGATIONS. BUT FROM SOME REPUBLICAN LEANING VOTERS WHO I SPOKE TO, THAT GAVE THEM A BIT OF PAUSE HERE AND YOU DO HAVE THE FACT THAT WARNOCK SPENT A TON OF MONEY, OUTSPENT HERSCHEL WALKER BY $78 MILLION BUT THEY ARE STILL GOING TO A RUNOFF. THIS IS A STATE THAT SEEMS INCREDIBLY POLARIZED, MORE POLARIZED THAN PURPOSE.  ELLISON BARBER IN ATLANTA, THANK YOU. > BRENDON BUCK, TALK TO US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU SEE GEORGIA GIVEN THE NUMBERS THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING AND THE EXIT POLLING AND WHERE THIS RACE IS HEADED HERE?  YEAH. BRIAN KEMP NOT BEING ON THE BALLOT IS GOING TO BE A HUGE DEAL IN GEORGIA. BRIAN KEMP IS A VERY POPULAR GOVERNOR BUT DOESN'T HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP WITH HERSCHEL WALKER. OBVIOUSLY, WE KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP AND KEMP HAD A BIT OF A FIGHT AND HERSCHEL WALKER WAS DONALD TRUMP'S CANDIDATE. AND IN THE PRIMARY, WHEN BRIAN KEMP WAS FACING A CHALLENGE, HERSCHEL WALKER DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO HELP HIM AND BRIAN KEMP REMEMBERS THAT. WHILE HERSCHEL WALKER WAS STRUGGLING THROUGHOUT THIS GENERAL ELECTION TO GET TO THAT 50%, BRIAN KEMP DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO LIFT A FINGER FOR HIM. I WILL BE CURIOUS TO SEE WHETHER THE KEMP APPARATUS, POPULAR IN GEORGIA, COMES OUT TO TRY TO SAVE HERSCHEL WALKER AT THIS POINT. I HAVE TO THINK JUST THE TWO OF THEM HEAD TO HEAD WITH SO MUCH AT STAKE AND A LOT OF FRANKLY MOMENTUM FOR DEMOCRATS RIGHT NOW, THAT THE RUNOFF IS GOING TO FAVOR WARNOCK. WE SAW THIS TWO YEARS AGO. WE SAW A LOT OF DEMOCRATIC ENERGY COME IN AND STEAL AWAY A REPUBLICAN SEAT IN THE DEEP SOUTH, SO IF I'M THE WALKER CAMPAIGN I'M NERVOUS GOING INTO A RUNOFF.  STACY ABRAMS LOST THE GOVERNORSHIP BUT THERE'S NO DOUBT HER CAMPAIGN TRANSFORMED GEORGIA. > LET'S GO OUT WEST AND GET AN UPDATE FROM OUR REPORTERS STILL IN THOSE NOT YET CALLED RACES. JOINING ME FROM PHOENIX IS VON HILL LARD AND LAS VEGAS GUAD VENEGAS. GIVE US AN UPDATE ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN ARIZONA?  I THINK THAT WE JUST GOT SOME NEW NUMBERS HERE FROM THE MARICOPA COUNTY RECORDERS OFFICE AND WHAT THESE NUMBERS ARE ULTIMATELY GOING TO BE TELLING US IS THE FACT THAT WE WILL NOT LIKELY KNOW THE RESULTS OUT OF ARIZONA UNTIL THURSDAY NIGHT. YOU CAN SEE THE GOVERNOR'S RACE, A 12,000 GAP NOW SEPARATING KATY HOBBS FROM KARI LAKE AND BLAKE MASTERS, HE IS A LARGER GAP, MORE ROOM HE HAS TO MAKE UP HERE. THERE IS A PARTICULAR BATCH OF ABOUT 275,000 BALLOTS THAT WE DO NOT KNOW THE TREND LINES, WHETHER THEY WILL FAVOR KATIE HOBBS OR KARI LAKE. THESE ARE MAIL BALLOTS INSTEAD OF MAILING THEM BACK THEY WALKED INTO THE POLLING PLACES AND HAND DELIVERED THEM. MARICOPA OFFICIALS SAY THAT THEY WILL NOT TABULATE THOSE BALLOTS UNTIL TOMORROW AND WILL NOT RELEASE THE RESULTS OF SEVERAL TENS OF THOUSANDS UNTIL TOMORROW NIGHT PROBABLY AROUND 9:00 EASTERN. EVERYBODY SHOULD TAKE A PAUSE HERE OVER THE NEXT 36 HOURS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT MORE TABULATING OF VOTES TO DO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN MARICOPA 400,000 BALLOTS.  TAKE A BREATH IS THE LESSON HERE. FROM YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT STATE, DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF WHO IS MORE LIKELY, WHAT POLITICAL AFFILIATION IS MORE LIKELY TO GET A BALLOT IN THE MAIL AND WALK TO DROP IT OFF?  RIGHT. THIS IS THE DIFFICULTY ASPECT OF IT. IN 2018 I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU BACK HERE, ELECTION NIGHT MARTHA McSALLY HAD THE LEAD AND IT WAS THIS BATCH OF VOTES, MAIL BALLOTS THAT ACTUALLY, SURGED KEERSON CINEMA TO SERVING A TERM IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. 2020, IT WAS THOSE BALLOTS THAT BENEFITTED DONALD TRUMP. WHAT WE SAW HIS -- WHAT WAS A LARGE GAP BETWEEN HIM AND JOE BIDEN ULTIMATELY COME DOWN TO 10,500 VOTES HE WON THOSE BALLOTS BY 55% TO 45%. SO THAT IS WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTION MARKS. I THINK WE SHOULD NOTE ALSO IF I MAY, TONIGHT WE'RE GOING TO BE GETTING MORE RESULTS HERE OUT OF MARICOPA COUNTY AND OVER THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT WE SAW KARI LAKE SHRINK THE MARGIN AND MAY AND COULD BE ANTICIPATING THOBS RE-EXPAND HER LEAD TONIGHT. THOSE WERE BALLOTS RECEIVED SATURDAY, SUNDAY, MONDAY AND HOBBS HAS OVERWHELMINGLY WON VOTES MAILED BACK. YOU SHOULD SEE THE 12,000 MARGIN BALLOON BACK UP BEFORE TOMORROW LIKELY SHRINKING AGAIN. MATTER OF WHETHER KARI LAKE IS ABLE TO ELLIPSE KATIE HOBBS. FOR BLAKE MASTERS IT'S TOUGHER, GUYS.  YOU HAVE A LOT OF WAITING TO DO AS THEY COUNT THE BALLOTS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. > QUAD IS IN NEVADA, THE OTHER STATE TOO CLOSE TO CALL. REPUBLICANS ARE UP IN THE SENATE AND GOVERNOR'S RACES, THOUGH. WHEN WILL WE KNOW?  WE ARE TOLD IT COULD BE A FEW DAYS UNTIL THEY COUNT THE MAIL-IN BALLOTS. I WAS LISTENING TO VON, A LOT OF THE SAME IS HAPPENING HERE EXCEPT HERE, WE'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO TWO COUNTIES, THE SECOND LARGEST, WE HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW MANY MAIL-IN BALLOTS CAME IN. LESS THAN 20,000. THAT'S GOOD TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHEN YOU SEE HOW CLOSE THE RACES ARE. THE OTHER COUNTIES CLARKE COUNTY WHERE THE VAST MAJORITY OF VOTERS ARE IN NEVADA WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY MAIL-IN VOTES CAME IN ON ELECTION DAY. THE RACE FOR THE U.S. SENATE, THE INCUMBENT AND ADAM LAXALT THE CHALLENGER UP BY 23,000 VOTES. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. IT'S NARROW. WE NEED AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MANY MAIL-IN VOTES CAME IN, HOW MANY BALLOTS CAME IN HERE TO CLARKE COUNTY TO SEE WHAT THIS LEAD MEANS FOR ADAM LAXALT. HE'S UP BY 22,000. SAY CLARKE COUNTY HAS 100,000 BALLOTS THEY STILL HAVE TO COUNT CORTEZ MASTO HAS A CHANCE OF CATCHING UP. BUT WE WON'T FIND OUT UNTIL MAYBE AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR NOW WHEN THEY'RE SPEAKING TO THE PRESS. THAT'S WHEN WE'LL GET ANSWERS AND TELL US HOW MANY MAIL-IN BALLOTS THEY HAVE. MORE DETAILS TO SEE HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO HAVE SOME MORE INFORMATION HERE.  IT'S NOT JUST, QUAD, THE NEVADA SENATE RACE WHERE WE STILL DON'T A PROJECTION, WE'RE WAITING FOR THE VOTE COUNT TO COME IN, BUT THE NEVADA GOVERNOR'S RACE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN AT PLAY, CRIME, AS YOU KNOW, FORMER SHERIFF, AGAINST THE INCUMBENT DEMOCRAT, THE ECONOMY WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INFLATION NUMBERS NEVADA IS SEEING.  IN THAT RACE, YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE, LOMBARDO THE CHALLENGE IS ABOUT 40,000 VOTES UP FROM GOVERNOR STEVE SISOLAK. TALKING TO NONPARTISAN VOTERS AND WHAT COULD HAPPEN HERE FROM WHAT THEY TOLD US, YOU CAN SEE SOME SPLIT TICKETS FROM THESE NONPARTISANS. A LOT TOLD US WHEN I VOTE AND I MENTIONED THE NONPARTISANS BECAUSE THERE'S A LARGE NUMBER OF NONPARTISAN VOTERS IN NEVADA TOLD US, I MIGHT BE VOTING FOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO AND JOE LOMBARDO. WE COULD SEE SPLIT TICKETS. THINGS LOOK BETTER FOR JOE LOMBARDO WITH THE 40,000 VOTES FOR LOMBARDO AND LAXALT, THE TWO REPUBLICANS UP, THEY'RE WAITING TO SEE HOW MANY VOTES STILL HAVE TO GET COUNTED HERE IN CLARKE COUNTY TO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF LEAD. ONLY THEN WILL WE HAVE AN IDEA WHAT OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD US, IS THAT IT COULD BE A FEW DAYS UNTIL THEY ARE DONE COUNTING ALL OF THESE VOTES. WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE HOW MANY VOTES THEY HAVE INSIDE THE PROCESSING CENTER.  WE WILL SET OUR ALARMS FOR 2:30 TODAY FOR THAT NEWS CONFERENCE OUTING OF CLARKE COUNTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. > LET'S BRING IN MARIA TERESA COMAR TO GET INTO THIS. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING FOR?  RIGHT NOW, IN NEVADA SPECIFICALLY IN ARIZONA, WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR WHAT IS THE TURNOUT OF YOUNG LATINOS. YOUNG LATINOS, FOLKS MAY NOT REALIZE, THE LARGER SHARE OF THE LATINO VOTING POPULATION IN THE STATES AND THEY HAVE BEEN LAGGING BEHIND IN -- SINCE LAST RESULTS ON MONDAY. THAT IS GOING TO HELP DETERMINE WHO IS GOING TO CONTROL THE SENATE. IN GEORGIA ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FOLKS DIDN'T REALIZE BUT IN GEORGIA BETWEEN THE LAST -- BETWEEN ELECTION DAY AND THE SPECIAL RUNOFF DAY, BACK WHEN WARNOCK WON, THERE WERE 50,000 YOUTH THAT TURNED 18 DURING THAT FOUR WEEK, SIX WEEK PERIOD. VOTER LATINO REGISTERED 15% OF FOLKS AND THAT IS A SILVER LIGHTNING FOR THE DEMOCRATS IF THEY ARE ABLE TO RUN A ROBUST VOTER EFFORT ON TOP OF THEIR MOBILIZATION EFFORT.  THANK YOU SO MUCH. GOOD TO SEE YOU. LISTEN, THERE IS A QUESTION TODAY, I KNOW WE'RE TALKING 2022, I KNOW WE ARE, BUT ALSO SIMULTANEOUSLY TALKING 2024 BECAUSE THERE ARE IMPLICATIONS WHAT HAPPENS THIS WEEK AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN A COUPLE YEARS. IS THAT ANNOYING TO YOU? MAYBE. LET'S BE REAL, WE GOT TO TALK ABOUT IT, RIGHT. SPECIFICALLY, WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE DONALD TRUMP FACTOR. LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN FLORIDA AND NOW CALL THE RON DeSANTIS FACTOR THERE, LET'S TALK ABOUT IT. RYAN NOBLES JOINING US FROM WEST PALM BEACH AND FILL, DEPUTY EDITOR FOR THE \"WASHINGTON POST.\" ALI, LET ME START WITH YOU, IF YOU LOOK AT WHO HAD A STRONG NIGHT, GOVERNOR RON DeSANTIS WITH PEOPLE CHANTING TWO MORE YEARS INSTEAD OF FOUR, BAUFRS BECAUSE OF THE SPECULATION AROUND A 2024 RUN. \"THE NEW YORK POST\" I THINK WE HAVE THAT GRAPHIC. NOT DeSANTIS, BUT DEFUTURE. TALK US THROUGH.  YEAH. THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT REPUBLICANS, CLEVER, YES, HAVE BEEN HAVING OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. EVERY TIME I HAVE GONE TO A CPAC GATHERING OR OTHER CONSERVATIVE CONFERENCE THERE HAVE BEEN STRAW POLLS DOWN THAT SHOW DONALD TRUMP LEADING THE PAC BUT RON DeSANTIS RIGHT THERE SEEN AS THE HEIR APPARENT TO THE TRUMP MANTLE IF YOU TAKE TRUMP OUT OF THE STRAW POLLS. EVERYTHING IS UNOFFICIAL BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT'S A GOOD GAUGE OF HOW THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THINKING WHAT ITS FUTURE MIGHT LOOK LIKE. STILL IN THE TRUMP IMAGE, BUT MAYBE NOT WITH TRUMP HIMSELF AS THE STANDARD BEARER. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT THE FORMER PRESIDENT'S MINDSET IS TOO BECAUSE HE'S OUT GIVING NICKNAMES AND VOICE TO THE SCHISM THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE BETWEEN DeSANTIS A FORMER ALLY OF HIS AND TRUMP. THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT FROM SOURCES BUT THE FACT IT'S BEING LITIGATED PUT THE NICKNAME OUT FOR DeSANTIS A FEW DAYS BEFORE DeSANTIS' RE-ELECTION HERE, A DAY BEFORE TRUMP CAME TO THE STATE AND CAMPAIGNED, NOT WITH DeSANTIS, BUT WITH SENATOR MARCO RUBIO, IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE'S SOME BAD BLOOD BREWING HERE ALREADY, AND IT'S ANNOYING TO TALK ABOUT PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS WHEN IT'S 2022, BUT FIRST OF ALL, WE LOVE THIS STUFF AND WE DO IT SO THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS TO BUT THIS IS WHAT THE REALITY IS. THE DAY AFTER THE MIDTERMS ARE OVER, IT'S WHEN WE IMMEDIATELY PIVOT TO WHAT'S NEXT BECAUSE ALL THE CANDIDATES ARE DOING THAT. OPERATIVES ARE DOING THAT AND DONORS ARE DOING THAT. THEY'RE READY TO START SEEING WHAT THE FIELD MIGHT LOOK LIKE. AGAIN, IT'S NOT JUST RON DeSANTIS WHO IS PROBABLY THINKING ABOUT THIS. IT'S TRUMP BUT ALSO PEOPLE LIKE NIKKI HALEY, RICK SCOTT, MIKE POMPEO. WE KNOW THE NAMES PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT IT. NOW IS THE TIME WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT IT  CONSIDERING HOW MANY TAILOR SWIFT LYRICS YOU CAN WORK IN TO DISCUSSING THESE RACES.  SO MANY.  THE STANDOFF BETWEEN THE MEN. THE BAD BLOOD.  RYAN, GLAD YOU EXPLAINED IT.  I'M NOT A TAYLOR SWIFT PERSON.  YOU DIDN'T GET IT.  SORRY.  THAT WAS BRILLIANT.  TRUMP WAS A DRAG ON LOTS OF CANDIDATES LAST NIGHT. HE'S STILL CLAIMING VICTORY. HIS LAST POST ON TRUTH SOCIAL, QUOTE, 174 WINS AND 9 LOSSES. GREAT EVENING. AMAZING JOB BY SOME REALLY FANTASTIC CANDIDATES. HE ALSO HAD SERIOUSLY HIGH PROFILE DEFEATS LIKE DR. OZ, DOUG MASTRIANO IN PENNSYLVANIA, TUDOR NIXON IN MICHIGAN, BOLDUC IN NEW HAMPSHIRE. THE PUBLIC MESSAGING PUT WHAT ARE THE PRIVATE WHISPERS IN TRUMP WORLD RIGHT NOW?  FIRST OF ALL, THANKS FOR NOT PUTTING ME ON THE SPOT WITH TAYLOR SWIFT LYRICS. I COULD HAVE GONE THERE IF YOU ASKED ME. I'M GLAD I DIDN'T TO TAKE THAT CHALLENGE.  I'M GOING TO GET LYRICS IN AND THROW YOU ALL OVER THE BRIDGE.  BUT TO GET BACK TO THE THOUGHTS IN TRUMP WORLD THIS IS NOT THE NARRATIVE THAT THEY WERE EXPECTING WHEN DONALD TRUMP CALLED ALL OF THIS CLOSEST ADVISORS TO MAR-A-LAGO LAST NIGHT FOR WHAT HE EXPECTED TO BE THE TYPE OF PARTY WHERE HE COULD TAKE CREDIT FOR EVERYTHING AN THE FACT THAT NOW THEY'RE BEING FORCED TO DEAL WITH THIS NARRATIVE THAT PERHAPS HE WAS A DRAG ON SOME OF THESE CANDIDATES, THAT HE HAD HOPED WOULD WIN, AND MAYBE COULD BE PREVENTING THE REPUBLICANS FROM TAKING CONTROL OF THE SENATE, AND A MUCH NARROW, MUCH MORE NARROW MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE, IS A BIG PROBLEM FOR TRUMP AS HE MAKES THE CASE THAT HE IS THE MOST DOMINANT CANDIDATE IN THE 2024 ELECTION. TRUMP IS ALREADY DOING WHAT TRUMP DOES, RIGHT. FINDING A WAY TO SPIN THESE RESULTS IN HIS -- TO HIS BENEFIT. HE'S FOCUSING ON THE FACT THAT HE DID PUT OUT A TON OF ENDORSEMENTS OVER THE COURSE OF THE 2022 CAMPAIGN AND JUST FOCUSING ON THOSE LARGELY NONCOMPETITIVE RACES WHERE HIS CANDIDATES WERE SUCCESSFUL AND HE'S EITHER IGNORING THE RESULTS IN PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA OR FINDING BLAME. FOR INSTANCE, IN THE RACE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, WHERE HE CLAIMED THAT DON BOLDUC, THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE THERE, DIDN'T FOCUS ENOUGH ON THE 2020 ELECTION IN HIS RACE AGAINST THE INCUMBENT MAGGIE HASSAN WHICH HASSAN WON EASILY. THIS IS ALL AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF WHAT ALI WAS TALKING ABOUT. HE'S ALREADY ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT NEXT WEEK HERE IN PALM BEACH AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT IS STILL GOING TO BE TO ANNOUNCE A RACE FOR PRESIDENT WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. THIS IS NOT THE NARRATIVE THAT TRUMP AND HIS TEAM WERE EXPECTING TO COME OUT OF THE RESULTS FROM LAST NIGHT.  IF TRUMP DOES ANNOUNCE, WHICH I THINK IT LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING TO, AND IF DeSANTIS SAYS LISTEN, LOOK WHAT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO AND WHAT TRUMP IS NOT ABLE TO DO, I'M ALSO GOING TO GET IN THIS RACE, MY QUESTION IS, HOW UGLY DOES IT GET AND DAMAGING DOES IT GET? WE HAD TRUMP YESTERDAY SAYING HE KNOWS SECRETS ABOUT RON DeSANTIS AND ONLY HIS WIFE KNOWS. REMINDED ME OF STUFF HE WENT AFTER TED CRUZ WITH IN 2016  YEAH. KATY, IT COULD CERTAINLY GET UGLY. WE KNOW HOY NASTY THE CAMPAIGNS CAN BE WHEN TRUMP IS ONE OF THE CANDIDATES. WE SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THE ATTACKS CAN GO EACH WAY AND SEEN TRUMP FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BE THE DOMINANT FORCE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, BUT HE'S BEEN UNCHALLENGED LARGELY WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. HE'S NEVER HAD A FLORIDA GOVERNOR COMING OFF A MASSIVE RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN THE WAY RON DeSANTIS IS AS A POTENTIAL RIVAL TAKE IT TO HIM AND GO TO THE VOTERS AND SAY I KNOW HOW TO WIN AND BROADEN THE COALITION OF VOTERS TO GET BACK THE WHITE HOUSE BUT I CAN GET THINGS DONE AND GOVERN. THAT'S THE MESSAGE YOU COULD SEE A RON DeSANTIS TAKE TO TRUMP AND I THINK WE'D BE FOOLINGING OURSELVES TO THINK TRUMP RUNS THROUGH AS THE FAVORITE. I THINK IT COULD BE DIFFICULT FOR HIM TO NAVIGATE THE ENVIRONMENT AND LAST NIGHT SHOWED THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO THE BREATH OF APPEAL THAT TRUMP HAS ACROSS THE BROAD ELECTORATE  AS --  MICHAEL STEELE ABOUT THAT, IF DeSANTIS AND TRUMP FIRING BACK AT EACH OTHER, HOW DAMAGING IS THAT FORT PARTY IN '24?  I THINK IN ONE RESPECT YOU COULD SAY IT'S HUGELY DAMAGING BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT THIS DYNAMIC WHERE CLEARLY DeSANTIS IS GENERATING A LOT OF ENERGY AROUND HIS EFFORTS IN FLORIDA THAT HAVE EXPANDED ACROSS THE POLITICAL UNIVERSE INSIDE THE GOP BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT THE -- THE TRUMP FACTOR, WHICH IS, AN UNKNOWN. I'VE BEEN SAYING FOR SOME TIME NOW, I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS IN THE PRESS AND CERTAINLY A LOT OF PEOPLE IN POLITICS AREN'T REALLY CATCHING ON IS, TRUMP HASN'T ENGAGED YET. TRUMP IS JUST SITTING THERE SAYING I'M VERY, VERY MUCH CONSIDERING POSSIBLY DOING.  PROBABLY.  PROBABLY. WHEN HE DECIDES TO DO IT, IT CHANGES THE WAY PEOPLE LOOK AT HIM AND RESPOND TO HIM REAL TIME INSIDE THE PARTY. THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN PLAY OUT IN THE PAST.  SO YOU THINK DeSANTIS DOES NOT DO IT?  I'M NOT 100% CONVINCED. I'VE TALKED TO SOME DeSANTIS PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE, THEY'RE LOOKING TO '28 BECAUSE THEY THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE MORE OF A HOT MESS.  IS THAT A CHRIS KRISTI MISTAKE.  YOU ALSO HAVE SOME OF THE DeSANTIS PEOPLE LIKE HE'S READY TO PLAY, DEPENDING ON HOW WHAT I JUST SAY, PLAYS OUT.  HE CAN'T JUMP IN TOO FAST. HE'S JUST BEEN RE-ELECTED AND HE COULD TAKE CREDIT ARGUABLY, CHUCK TODD WAS POINTING THIS OUT FOR SEVERAL NEW CONGRESSIONAL HOUSE SEATS BECAUSE OF THE WAY HE GERRYMANDERED AND FORCED THROUGH THE REDISTRICTING IN FLORIDA. SINGLE HANDEDLY REALLY. AND ADDED TO THE LIST OF HOUSE SEATS.  HE CAN'T TAKE CREDIT FOR ANYTHING BEYOND FLORIDA. AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT METRIC HERE. TRUMP ARGUABLY CAN. YOU KNOW, IF -- YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A GOVERNORSHIP IN ARIZONA, HE CAN TAKE CREDIT FOR THAT. YEAH, HE LOST PENNSYLVANIA, BUT YOU LOOK AT WHERE ELSE TRUMP HAS INFLUENCED AND HAS SOME IMPACT AND THAT IS THE COMPETING INTEREST RATES RIGHT NOW.  I THINK IT COMES BACK TO SOMETHING YOU SAID AT THE TOP OF THE SHOW, WHAT ARE VOTERS SAYING. ALI AND RYAN KNOWS IT, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIKE HEY, I DIG DONALD TRUMP, I LOVE SOMETHING FRESH.  LET'S TALK ABOUT NUMBERS NOW BECAUSE AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING CONTROL OF THE SENATE STILL HANGS IN THE BALANCE WITH KEY RACES IN ARIZONA AND NEVADA. THEY'RE STILL TO BE CALLED, GEORGIA RACE HEADED FOR A RUNOFF. I WANT TO BRING IN TOM, THE CEO OF TARGET SMART POLITICAL DATA ANALYTICS COMPANY. TOM, LOOKING AT WHAT'S OUT THERE IN MARICOPA COUNTY AND CLARKE COUNTY, HOW ARE YOU READING THOSE RACES AND WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE LIBERTARIAN VOTES GOING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER OR DIVIDING BETWEEN WALKER AND -- BETWEEN WALKER, YOU KNOW, AND WARNOCK OR STAYING SNOEM.  THESE ARE THE KEY QUESTIONS WE'RE EXPECTING AND THESE THINGS CHANGE ON A MOMENT BY MOMENT BASIS. WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR FROM CLARKE COUNTY, NEVADA WHERE ALMOST 75% OF THE VOTES ARE COMING FROM AND THE STATE IS COMING FROM ABOUT HOW MANY VOTES. RIGHT NOW, DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THEY'RE ABOUT 100,000 VOTES STILL TO BE COUNTED FROM CLARKE COUNTY, NEVADA. THOSE ARE OVERWHELMINGLY MAIL VOTES WHICH WERE OVERWHELMINGLY DEMOCRATIC VOTES. IF THOSE NUMBERS BEAR OUT THAT'S A GOOD SIGN FOR CORTEZ MASTO AND THE OTHER THING WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND, SOMETHING WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER STATES, MAIL BALLOTS CAN KEEP COMING IN AND WE HAVE TO KEEP WATCHING FOR A WHILE HERE. SIMILARLY, IN ARIZONA, MARICOPA COUNTY AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF VOTES IN ARIZONA. WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR IN ARIZONA IS THAT MARK KELLY, WHAT WE'VE BEEN REPORTING THROUGH THE EARLY VOTING PERIOD MARK KELLY WAS OVER PERFORMING WITH THE EARLY VOTES. THIS IS ONE THAT'S LOOKING TO BE VERY CLOSE. AT THIS POINT THERE ARE CERTAINLY A LOT OF THINGS THAT THE KELLY CAMPAIGN HAS TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT IN GEORGIA IN THE RUNOFF ANOTHER BIG QUESTION IS THE TIME PERIOD. WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IT'S ONLY A FOUR-WEEK RUNOFF. THAT MEANS MAIL BALLOTS WHICH WERE A BIG ADVANTAGE FOR DEMOCRATS NOT JUST IN GEORGIA BUT AROUND THE COUNTRY, WON'T BE AS BIG OF A FACTOR IN GEORGIA IN THE RUNOFF. THAT SAID, SENATOR WARNOCK AND HIS TEAM KNOW HOW TO WIN IN THESE SITUATIONS AND DID IT TWO YEARS AGO AND THEY WILL BE LOOKING TO DO IT AGAIN NEXT MONTH.  AND TOM, WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE SENATE ACCIDENT NOS YOU'RE -- SCENARIOS WHICH ONE GOES WHICH WAY AND GEORGIA BECOMES THE ALL-IN RACE?  WE'LL KNOW MORE IN TERMS OF THE LANDSCAPE, RIGHT, AND THAT REPUBLICANS NEED TO WIN AT THIS POINT TWO OF THOSE THREE REMAINING SEATS TO BE CALLED. ARIZONA IS ONE THAT I DON'T THINK THEY FEEL AS GOOD ABOUT RIGHT NOW. IF THAT GOES THEY HAVE TO RUN THE TABLE AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO WIN NEVADA AND THEN WIN GEORGIA IN A RUNOFF. THAT'S DIFFICULT. AGAIN, IF THESE NUMBERS WE'RE HEARING OUT OF CLARKE COUNTY THAT WE'RE SEEING POTENTIALLY ANOTHER 100,000 VOTES COMING IN, AND WE SHOULDEN FINDING OUT ABOUT THAT MOMENTARILY, THAT MAKES NEVADA LOOKS DIFFICULT FOR THEM TOO. THEY'RE FACING AN UPHILL BATTLE. IT'S NOT THAT IT CAN'T BE DONE BUT THEY ARE FACING A SCENARIO IF THEY DON'T WIN ARIZONA OR NEVADA, THEN THE RUNOFF ISN'T FOR CONTROL ANYMORE.  WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. > WE HAVE NEWS FROM STEVE SCALISE MAKING IT OFFICIAL NOT GOING TO BE CHALLENGING KEVIN McCARTHY, WILL BE RUNNING FOR MAJORITY LEADER, THOUGH, OFFICIALLY. THAT IS IF THE REPUBLICANS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE. > OVER TO COLORADO, IT WAS A GOOD NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS THEY TOOK THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION, THE SENATE, AG'S OFFICE AND FOUR OUT OF SIX HOUSE RACES CALLED SO FAR. TWO INCLUDING THE SURPRISING RACE THAT HAS LAUREN BOEBERT TRAILING, ARE STILL UNCALLED AT THIS HOUR. YOU CAN SEE HOW CLOSE THE MARGIN IS RIGHT THERE. LET US BRING IN COLORADO DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MICHAEL BENNETT WHO WON AGAIN LAST NIGHT, WON HIS RE-ELECTION. SENATOR, ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE YOU. WHAT DO YOU CHALK THIS UP TO?  I CHALK THIS UP TO A RELENTLESS ECONOMIC MESSAGE ABOUT HOW 40 YEARS OF WASHINGTON CONSENSUS, ABOUT OUTSOURCING AND ABOUT TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS ISN'T WORKING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND IT WAS A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN ME AND MY OPPONENT ON THAT. IT'S A REPUDIATION OF DONALD TRUMP'S CHAOS AND RECOGNITION THAT WE ACTUALLY MADE PROGRESS CAPPING DRUG PRICES FOR SEASON, FOR EXAMPLE, REQUIRING MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THE OVERTURNING OF ROE VERSUS WADE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS -- MADE PEOPLE FURIOUS. THAT COMBINATION OF THE THREE THINGS MADE IT A VERY GOOD NIGHT IN COLORADO.  SENATOR BENNETT, IT'S HALLIE. I WONDER HOW MUCH YOU SEE THE TRUMP FACTOR AT PLAY IN YOUR RACE. I SPOKE WITH YOUR OPPONENT A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION AND ASKED ABOUT THAT AND HE WAS CLEAR AS HE SAID BEFORE, HE IS HIS OWN MAN. WE KNOW THE FORMER PRESIDENT WENT AFTER HIM IN COLORADO. HOW MUCH DO YOU SEE THAT AS BEING A FACTOR IN YOUR VICTORY AND RETURN TO THE SENATE?  YEAH. I DON'T THINK IT WAS A HUGE FACTOR BECAUSE I DON'T THINK MY OPPONENT WAS EVER VERY PERSUASIVE ON THAT SUBJECT. HE VOTED TWICE FOR DONALD TRUMP, AND HE GOT RELIGION THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION DAY, BUT I DO THINK IT'S FASCINATING TO SEE COUNTIES, YOU KNOW THESE COUNTIES WELL, LIKE DOUGLAS COUNTY WHERE I ONLY LOST BY 6 POINTS LAST NIGHT, EL PASO COUNTY WHERE I ONLY LOST BY 6 POINTS LAST NIGHT, THOSE ARE PLACES DEMOCRATS HISTORICALLY, INCLUDING MYSELF, YOU KNOW, EXPECT TO LOSE BY AS MUCH AS 20 POINTS. WHAT WE SAW IN RED IN RURAL COLORADO WAS SOMETHING VERY DIFFERENT THIS YEAR.  SENATOR, LOOKING AHEAD TO 2024, THAT'S PAINFUL, WE'RE BARELY SURVIVING AFTER BEING UP ALL NIGHT ON 2022, BUT OUR EXIT POLLING SHOWS TWO-THIRDS OF VOTERS DO NOT WANT PRESIDENT BIDEN TO RUN AGAIN. YOU ALIGN WITH THE PRESIDENT CERTAINLY BEFORE THE MIDTERMS. WHERE DO YOU STAND ON WHETHER BIDEN 2024 SHOULD BE THE CANDIDATE? THE STANDARD BEARER AFTER SEEING THESE RESULTS?  LET ME SAY I DO THINK WE'RE GOING TO WIN IN NEVADA AND IN ARIZONA AND THAT'S GOING TO GIVE US A REAL SHOT AT GEORGIA AS WELL WHICH I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT BEFORE WE GO TO '24. I'M GOING TO SAY WHAT YOU WOULD PROBABLY EXPECT, THIS IS UP TO PRESIDENT BIDEN TO DECIDE. HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO CONSIDER A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS IN MAKING THIS DECISION. HE WAS THE ONE PERSON OUT OF 330 MILLION PEOPLE THAT BEAT DONALD TRUMP AND I THINK THAT IF THERE WERE A REMATCH BASED ON THE RESULTS WE SAW LAST NIGHT, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT THAT HE WOULD BEAT DONALD TRUMP AGAIN.  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE LAUREN BOEBERT RACE?  IT'S AMAZING. I TALKED TO HER OPPONENT TODAY. THE RACE IS VERY, VERY CLOSE AND I THINK SHE'S GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING UP HER DEFICIT AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TREAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS WITH CONTEMPT AND SPEND ALL OF YOUR TIME ON NATIONAL TELEVISION INSTEAD OF DOING THE HARD WORK THAT PEOPLE OF THE WESTERN SLOPE OF COLORADO DESERVE IN PUEBLO COLORADO DESERVE OUT OF THEIR CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVE. WE SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING LATER TODAY.  IS COLORADO A PURPLE STATE OR WOULD YOU SAY THAT COLORADO IS A BLUE STATE?  I WOULD SAY IT'S A PURPLE STATE. KATY, WE HAVE THE LARGEST REGISTRATION BY FAR IN COLORADO ARE UNAFFILIATED VOTERS AND WHY ANYBODY IN ONE OF THESE JOBS IS SMART TO TRY TO RUN LIKE YOU'RE 20 POINTS BEHIND, WHICH IS HOW I TREATED THIS RACE AND I TREATED EVERY ONE OF MY RACES. I DON'T -- I THINK COLORADO WILL BE A PURPLE STATE FOR A LONG TIME TO COME.  LET'S TALK IF THE SENATE IS AS TIGHT AS WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE, IT'S GOING TO BE TIGHT, RIGHT, HOW DO YOU SEE THE ROLE OF ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES, FOR EXAMPLE, LISTEN, THIS IS HYPOTHETICAL, SENATOR JOE MANCHIN? WHAT ARE YOUR GOVERNING PRIORITIES IN THE SENATE IF THE HOUSE DOES END UP WITH A HOUSE SPEAKER KEVIN McCARTHY LOOKING TO RECONCILE BILLS ON THAT FRONT FROM A GOVERNING PERSPECTIVE?  I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE HONESTLY VERY DIFFICULT WITH THE HOUSE LED BY KEVIN McCARTHY. I HAVE NOT HAD TROUBLE FINDING REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE TO WORK WITH, BUT I MEAN, McCARTHY IS SO -- SO BEHOLDEN TO DONALD TRUMP, MAYBE THAT WILL CHANGE. I DOUBT IT WILL, WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW, THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF FRICTION IN THE AIR. THE SENATE CAN CONTINUE TO APPROVE JUDGES AND I THINK WE SHOULD PASS BILLS THAT SHOW WHAT WE STAND FOR COMPARED TO WHAT McCARTHY AND THE REPUBLICANS STAND FOR AND THAT NEEDS TO BE, AS I SAID, A VERY EXPLICIT ECONOMIC MESSAGE THAT IS GOING TO RESONATE WITH WORKING PEOPLE IN RED AND BLUE PARTS OF AMERICA. THE DEMOCRAT -- LONG OVERDUE FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE'VE BEGUN TURNING THE PAGE, BRINGING THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY BACK, FIGHTING AND WINNING THOSE WINS OVER PHARMA WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR FOR GENERATION, BUT THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO. WE CAN PASS BILLS TO REVERSE TRUMP TAX CUTS FOR THE RICH AND EXTEND MY TAX CUTS FOR WORKING PEOPLE THAT I WROTE WITH SHERROD BROWN. I THINK THERE'S WAYS OF CREATING DISTINCTIONS AND LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK TOGETHER IF WE CAN FIND PLACES WHERE WE CAN GET STUFF DONE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SENATOR BENNETT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US AND CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR EVICTORY.  UP NEXT, THE MISINFORMATION FLOODING SOCIAL MEDIA, AS THE RIGHT'S HOPES OF A RED WAVE FALLS SHORT. BEN COLLINS JOINS US ON OUR COVERAGE OF THE 2022 MIDTERMS. THIS IS MSNBC. RAGE OF THE 2022 .

        "trs": "> HISTORY WAS MADE LAST NIGHT. FIRST WOMAN TO REPRESENT VERMONT IN THE HOUSE WAS ELECTED LAST NIGHT. BELIEVE IT OR NOT, SHE'S THE FIRST WOMAN, ALSO THE FIRST OPENLY LGBTQ PERSON TO REPRESENT VERMONT. SHE JOINS US NOW. CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT, HOW ARE YOU FEELING?  I AM FEELING TREMENDOUS. I FEEL SO HONORED THAT I'M GOING TO GET TO REPRESENT THIS STATE THAT I LOVE SO MUCH. IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE FOR ME.  ALSO, YOUR STATE VOTED TO ENSHRINE PROTECTIONS FOR ABORTION AS WELL. WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?  SO MUCH GOOD NEWS HERE IN VERMONT. YES, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON OUR REPRODUCTIVE LIBERTY AMENDMENT FOR FIVE YEARS. TO HAVE VERMONT COME OUT SO STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF REPRODUCTIVE FREE DON'DOMS WAS CONFIRMATION OF THE WORK I DID IN THE STATEHOUSE. IT WAS AN AMAZING RACE BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID WE COULDN'T DO WHAT WE DID. I'M THE CHILD OF AN IMMIGRANT, A WORKING CLASS MOM. AS YOU SAID, I'M OPENLY GAY. FORMER SCHOOLTEACHER. SO MANY REASONS WHY PEOPLE DIDN'T THINK WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PULL THIS OFF. WE REALLY TAPPED INTO THIS FEELING THAT VERMONTERS HAD THAT THEY WANTED A MESSAGE OF COURAGE AND KINDNESS AND REALLY TRYING TO PULL OUR COMMUNITIES BACK TOGETHER. IT WAS A BROAD COALITION THAT WE PUT TOGETHER. I COULDN'T BE MORE PROUD OF THE RACE THAT WE RAN.  WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE HOUSE YOU ARE LIKELY TO ENTER, WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE RED? WE DON'T KNOW BY WHAT MARGIN. THERE'S GOING TO BE AN OUTSIZED INFLUENCE BY ALL OF THE ELECTION DENIERS IN THAT GROUP, SOME VERY CONSERVATIVE AND EXTREME MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW IN THE REPUBLICAN MAJORITY, POSSIBLY LED BY KEVIN McCARTHY.  ABSOLUTELY. THAT'S BEEN ON MY MIND IN ERNEST FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS, OF COURSE. I'M WAKING UP TO A MUCH BETTER MAP THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD WAKE UP TO. I'M FEELING HOPEFUL, MUCH LIKE I THINK MANY PEOPLE WITHIN THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. IT DID NOT END UP BEING A REPUTATION OF THE BIDEN PRESIDENCY. THERE WAS NOT A RED WAVE. I SEE MANY SIGNS OF HOPE. LOOKS LIKE BOEBERT LOST HER SEAT, SOME OTHER EXTREMISTS THAT WENT DOWN. I THINK TRUMP DID NOT PERFORM AS WELL WITH HIS CANDIDATES AS PEOPLE THOUGHT HE WOULD. I'M FEELING LIKE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE FOR US TO ACTUALLY GET WORK DONE, BECAUSE THE ISSUES THAT IMPACT RURAL AMERICA ARE VERY SIMILAR WHETHER YOU ARE IN VERMONT OR WHETHER YOU ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY. WE REALLY HAVE TO GET BACK TO THINKING ABOUT WHAT WORKING PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY NEED. SO I'M GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR THOSE PARTNERS WHEREVER I CAN. I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH. IT IS.  CONGRATULATIONS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING YOU WHEN YOU BECOME A NEW MEMBER OF THE HOUSE. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. IT WAS A TOUGH NIGHT FOR SOME REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES WHO DENIED THE 2020 ELECTION RESULTS. LOOK AT THIS. SOME OF THE CANDIDATES WHO REFUSED TO ACCEPT PRESIDENT BIDEN'S WIN AND WHO LOST THEIR RACES LAST NIGHT. JOINING ME NOW IS JEH JOHNSON, FORMER DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, FORMER HEAD OF THE -- SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AND BEFORE THAT TOP OFFICIAL AT THE PENTAGON. FIRST OF ALL, WHAT MESSAGE DOES IT IS SEND THAT SO MANY OF THE PROMINENT ELECTION DENIERS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR LOST?  FIRST, I'M SORRY I'M NOT THERE IN PERSON. I'M IN COVID QUARANTINE IN NEW JERSEY. I'M SORRY I'M NOT THERE, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE YOU ARE AT 30 ROCK ACROSS FROM MY OFFICE. I'M FEELING FINE. I WILL BE OUT AND ABOUT IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. FINE, OUT IN A COUPLE DAYS. ANDREA N ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION, IF HISTORY IS A GUIDE, WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY FALLS FAR SHORT OF REPUBLICAN EXPECTATIONS, AND WHETHER THE REPUBLICANS EEK OUT A MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE, MY HOPE IS THAT WHAT COMES OUT OF THIS IS REPUBLICAN OFFICE HOLDERS, REPUBLICAN POLITICIANS, THOSE WHO ARE RUNNING ON A REPUBLICAN LINE, CONCLUDE THAT THE TRUMP-LAUREN BOEBERT STYLE OF BEING OUTRAGEOUSLY OFFENSIVE IN POLITICS IS GOING OUT OF STYLE, IS RUNNING OUT OF STEAM, IS SOMETHING MAYBE WE NEED TO RETHINK. MOCKING VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE, REMAINING SILENT IN THE FACE OF AN ATTACK LIKE THE ONE ON SPEAKER PELOSI'S HUSBAND, MY HOPE IS THAT COLLECTIVELY, REPUBLICANS BEGIN TO THINK THAT THIS STYLE OF POLITICS REALLY ISN'T WORKING VERY WELL AND THAT WE NEED TO MOVE ON TO BASIC COMMON DECENCY IN OUR POLITICAL DIALOG.  SECRETARY JOHNSON, IT'S HALLIE, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT, ONE OF THE STORY LINES WHAT HAPPENS WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE QUESTIONED THE 2020 ELECTION OR OUTRIGHT DENIED IT, RIGHT. WE'VE BEEN TRACKING THIS AT NBC NEWS. I WANT TO SHARE THE NUMBERS BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE INTERESTING HERE. 150 HOUSE RACES, 60 LOST. WE SAW SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN THE OTHER RACES. IN THE SENATE, BY THE WAY, 8 ELECTION DENIERS WINNING THEIR RACES ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, FIVE LOSING. LOOK AT GOVERNOR AND SECRETARY OF STATE. THESE ARE ARGUABLY, AS YOU KNOW, AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE STATEWIDE RACES FOR GOVERNOR, SECRETARY OF STATE, I WOULD ADD, FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL AS WELL, ARE SO CRITICAL IN DETERMINING THE MECHANISMS BY HOW PEOPLE VOTE. THEY HAVE A SAY IN YOUR STATE AND HOW YOU GO AND CAST YOUR BALLOT. TEN OF THE GOVERNORS, WE SHOWED THAT GRAPHIC ON THE SCREEN V LOST THEIR RACE, OR PROJECTED TO LOSE. ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE FIVE LOST, THREE WON, AND WE HAVE A NUMBER OF SEVERAL OUTSTANDING PROJECTIONS THAT ARE YET TO COME IN HERE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE HERE, LOOK AHEAD TO WHAT THIS MEANS FOR 2024, WHEN YOU LOOK AT STATE LIKE ARIZONA, RIGHT, OR MICHIGAN, WHERE ALL THREE OF THOSE STATEWIDE RACES HAD ELECTION DENIERS ON THE BALLOT, ALMOST A CLEAN SWEEP IN MICHIGAN, WE KNOW THAT THE GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE AND SECRETARY OF STATE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE LOST. IN ARIZONA IT'S STILL AN OPEN QUESTION. HOW MUCH DOES THAT CONCERN YOU AS YOU'RE LOOKING AHEAD TO 2024 AND FAITH FROM AMERICAN VOTERS ON THE LEGITIMACY OF OUR ELECTIONS?  HALLIE, ONE OF THE LAST THINGS I DID WHEN I WAS IN OFFICE AS SECRETARY OF DHS IN 2017 WAS TO DECLARE THAT OUR ELECTION INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT A LOT MORE ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO ELECTION INTEGRITY, BALLOT INTEGRITY. THE OTHER GOOD NEWS IS, EXAMPLES LIKE YOU CITED A NUMBER OF ELECTION DENIERS, BUT AMONG REPUBLICANS, YOU'VE GOT THE GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE WHO STOOD UP FOR THAT ELECTION RESULT, YOU'VE GOT RUSTY POWERS IN ARIZONA, REPUBLICAN WHO STOOD UP FOR THE ELECTION RESULT IN ARIZONA, KRENS SERRED BY THE LOCALLY REPUBLICAN PARTY AS A RESULT, BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS WHO TOOK THEIR OFFICE SERIOUSLY, TOOK THEIR OATH OF OFFICE SERIOUSLY, BUT WE'RE RIGHT TO FOCUS ON THIS PARTICULAR POINT OF CONCERN, STATE LEVEL, SECRETARIES OF STATE, SOME CASES ATTORNEYS GENERAL, WHO MAY TRY TO CAST DOUBT ON THE FUTURE ELECTIONS. YOU KNOW, THE REALITY IS, THAT THIS ELECTION CYCLE IN 2020 TURNOUT IS GROWING. THIS MAY WELL BE THE LARGEST MIDTERM TURNOUT IN HISTORY. 2018 AT THAT POINT CERTAINLY WAS. AND IN THE FACE OF COVID, WE'VE DONE A REMARKABLE JOB AT HAVING REMARKABLY SAFE AND SECURE ELECTIONS WITH THE VAST NUMBER OF MAIL-INS. THE NEAREST ROUND NUMBER PERCENTAGE IN TERMS OF VOTER FRAUD IS ZERO, AND SO THE FACTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES HERE.  JEH, I WANT TO CORRECT A COUPLE THINGS, NOT CORRECT BUT CLARIFY, LAUREN BOEBERT WE HAVE NOT CALLED TA RACE. IT'S CONSIDERED TOO CLOSE TO CALL BUT THE FACT THAT IT IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL IS SURPRISING CONSIDERING SHE WAS SAFE. NEWS FROM OUR FRIEND JAKE SHERMAN, KEVIN McCARTHY ANNOUNCED HE WILL BE RUNNING FOR SPEAKER. NO SURPRISE. HE RELEASED A LETTER TALKING ABOUT HOW HE EXPECTS THE REPUBLICANS WILL FLIP THE HOUSE. I CAN CONFIDENTLY REPORT WE WILL JOIN THE LIST BUILDING ON OUR SIGNIFICANT GAINS FROM LAST CYCLE TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF TAKING BACK THE HOUSE CAREFULLY WORDED. AND THAT'S WHY HE'S RUNNING. HE'S GOING TO BE IN CHARGE OF A CONFERENCE FULL OF ELECTION DENIERS. A LOT OF THE KEY ONES DIDN'T WIN, AS HALLIE POINTED OUT, BUT A LOT OF ELECTION DENIERS WERE IN SAFE RACES AND DID WIN AND THEY ARE GOING TO CONGRESS. SOME OF THEM ARE ALREADY THERE. HOW -- I MEAN THIS IS NOT -- INTO THE HE'S GOING TO LISTEN TO YOU, BUT IF YOU WERE GOING TO GIVE KEVIN McCARTHY ADVICE WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE HIM TO DO?  KEVIN McCARTHY IS ABOUT TO FIND OUT IT'S MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO BE THE MAJORITY LEADER, SPEAKER, THAN IT IS TO BE THE MINORITY LEADER. NANCY PELOSI, IN MY JUDGMENT, HAS BEEN THE MOST PHENOMENAL SPEAKER IN MODERN TIMES, SIMPLY BECAUSE OF HER ABILITY TO HOLD HER CAUCUS TOGETHER WHETHER IN THE MINORITY OR MAJORITY. KEVIN McCARTHY, IF HE'S ELECTED SPEAKER, IS ABOUT TO INHERIT A THIN MAJORITY WITH A VERY, VERY CRANKY MAJORITY WITH SOME REAL OUTLIERS IT WITHIN HIS CAUCUS. I KNOW FROM PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH PAST REPUBLICAN SPEAKERS WHILE I WAS IN OFFICE THAT IS A FRUSTRATING, DIFFICULT JOB, TO THE EXTENT HE LISTENS TO ME, MY ADVICE IS TO TRY TO, YOU KNOW, GOVERN FROM A CENTER POINT OF RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT JUST PLAY TO THE EXTREME BASE OF YOUR CAUCUS.  SECRETARY JEH JOHNSON, GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. SORRY YOU CANNOT BE ON SET. HOPEFULLY A QUICK COVID RECOVERY AND OUT OF QUARANTINE.  GET WELLEN.  FOR SURE. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE NEW DEVELOPMENTS. OFFICIALLY NOW IN THE RUNNING FOR KEVIN McCARTHY TO BE THE HOUSE SPEAKER AND HEARING FROM SENATE MINORITY LEADER MITCH McCONNELL ASKED ABOUT HOW HE'S FEELING ABOUT THINGS. I DON'T DEAL IN FEELINGS. HE SAID LET'S LOOK AT THE VOTE COUNT. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT JUST AFTER THE BREAK.  THAT INDICATES A LOT OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE.  WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT COMING UP. STAY WITH US IN JUST A COUPLE MINUTES. WE'LL BE BACK. COUPLE MINUTES. WE'LL BE BACK. 20221109175826.001|20221109175956.456",

        "trs": "> HE ALLOWED $4 TRILLION TO GO OUT AND THAT CAUSED INFLATION, AND WHAT REALLY CAUSED INFLATION IS ENERGY, AND MITCH McCONNELL ALLOWED $4 TRILLION TO BE WASTED BY THE DEMOCRATS, AND SO I COULD SEE SOMEBODY FIGHTING -- YOU KNOW, I KNOW HIM WELL, HE'S A GREAT GOVERNOR AND A GOOD SENATOR, SO WE WILL SEE.  THAT WAS DONALD TRUMP SLAMMING MINORITY LEADER, MITCH McCONNELL. AND PRAISING RICK SCOTT OF FLORIDA.  BE NICE.  HE NEEDS TO EAT VEGETABLES.  YEAH, MIX IN A SALAD.  ANYHOW, WITH US, WE HAVE CUPCAKE.  WE ALL LOVE CUPCAKE.  AND WITH US WE HAVE COLUMNIST FOR THE WASHINGTON POST, EUGENE ROBINSON, AND BEST-SELLING AUTHOR -- SHE JUST JOINED US AND SHE'S THE VICE CHAIR OF THE FORBES, AND MORE ON THAT COMING UP. VERY EXCITING.  YOU GOT THE BIGGEST APPLAUSE, SO I WILL GO TO YOU.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU.  I AM NOT AN IDIOT. WHAT HAPPENED, MAN?  SO I KEEP THINKING OF AN OLD STORY I HEARD WHEN I WAS A REPORTER IN CALIFORNIA A LONG TIME AGO, HIS NAME WAS DICK TUCK, AND HE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE ELECTED AND TOSSED OUT OF OFFICE, AND HE DECIDED TO RUN FOR SOMETHING HIMSELF, AND HE GOT CREAMED. HE CAME OUT TO GIVE A CONCESSION SPEECH THAT NIGHT, AND HE SAID, THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN, PAUSE, THOSE BASTARDS, AND I THINK OF THAT WHEN I THINK OF KARI LAKE.  I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS. JUST A COUPLE THINGS I WANT TO SAY. ONE, I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE A SHOUT-OUT TO MY SOUTH CAROLINA HOMEBOY, JAMIE HARRISON, THE DEAD OF THE DNC. EVERYBODY SAID THE DNC IS NOT DOING THIS OR THAT, AND IN THE END, NOT TOO SHABBY. YOU SAID HE HAD A 50-STATE STRATEGY, AND THAT'S WHAT HE DID. HE SAID HE WAS WORKING AT THE GRASSROOTS. THAT'S WHAT HE DID. HE DID REALLY WELL IN GOVERNORSHIPS. LET'S GIVE HIM A BIT OF CREDIT.  BIG TIME.  THE OTHER -- ONE OF THE OTHER CLEAR MESSAGES TO ME IS WHAT DOES THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOT NOW UNDERSTAND ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WANT THEM TO DO OR NOT DO ON ABORTION? RIGHT, THE ABORTION REFERENDUM IN PLACES LIKE KANSAS, AND CERTAINLY IN MICHIGAN, PEOPLE, WHETHER THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF ABORTION OR DISAPPROVE OF IT OR WHATEVER DO NOT WANT THAT FUNDAMENTAL PRIVACY RIGHT TAKEN AWAY. THEY WANT IT GUARANTEED. I JUST WONDER IF ANYBODY IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS GOING TO HEAR THAT MESSAGE.  AND ABORTION WAS ON THE BALLOT IN MICHIGAN AS WELL, AND WE HAD CANDIDATES TELL US A COUPLE MONTHS AGO THE DOBBS DECISION ENERGIZED VOTERS AND BROUGHT OUT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT OTHERWISE MIGHT NOT HAVE VOTED, AND IT LOOKS LIKE SHE COULD WIN BY A SLIM MARGIN.  AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO KNOW, ELECTION NIGHTS ARE KIND OF TRIGGERING FOR ME, AND I WISH I WOULD NOT HAVE EATON ALL THE CHINESE FOOD AND ALL THOSE SLICES OF PIZZA, BUT IT FEELS LIKE TO ME THE DOBBS DECISION WAS THE STRAW THAT BROKE THE CAMEL'S BACK, AND THE IDEA OF HOW MUCH WAS TOLERABLE. I SPOKE TO JOE AND MIKA ABOUT THIS, AND I SPENT THE BETTER PART OF THE YEAR OUTSIDE THIS COUNTRY TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT AMERICA, AND WHAT I COME BACK AND TELL MY FELLOW AMERICANS IS TO LIVE IN A DEMOCRACY IS A PRIVILEGE, THAT SOMEBODY LIKE ME, I DID NOT GROW UP IN A DEMOCRACY. TO COME AND GO TO THE POLLS AND DO IT SAFELY IS REALLY A PRIVILEGE, AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE REMINDED OF LAST NIGHT, AND WE TALK ABOUT TIM RYAN BEING A HERO, AND I AM SAD TIM DID NOT WIN THE OHIO SENATE RACE, AND HE SHOWED WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO BE A LEADER. I AM GLAD YOU HAD BOB WOODWARD AND MEACHAM ON EARLIER, AND I REMEMBER GETTING THE CALL FROM THEN VICE PRESIDENT, AL GORE, AND CALLING AND SAYING I WILL NOT CHALLENGE, AND I WAS THE ONE THAT TOOK THE CALL WHEN BARACK OBAMA CALLED HILLARY CLINTON IN 2016, AND MEANWHILE PEOPLE WERE CALLING HILLARY AND SAYING DON'T CONCEDE. AND THAT WAS BACK IN THE DARK AGES, AND WAIT, THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE NUMBERS NOT MAKING SENSE AND THE POLLS ARE OFF, AND SHE TOOK THE CALL AND AGREED AND THAT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER, AND WITH ABORTION, I THINK PEOPLE DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WOULD MEAN FOR BOTH, DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS.  LET'S SHOW TIM RYAN AND HOW IMPORTANT WHAT HE DID LAST NIGHT WAS. HERE IS HIS CONCESSION.  I HAVE A PRIVILEGE, A PRIVILEGE, AS SOMEBODY THAT WAS THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE, I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO CONCEDE THIS RACE TO J.D. VANCE, BECAUSE THE WAY THIS COUNTRY OPERATES IS THAT WHEN YOU LOSE AN ELECTION, YOU CONCEDE. [ APPLAUSE ] AND YOU RESPECT -- YOU RESPECT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE, RIGHT? WE CAN'T HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE IF YOU WIN IT'S A LEGITIMATE ELECTION AND IF YOU LOSE SOMEBODY STOLE IT. THAT IS NOT HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD IN THE UNITED STATES.  YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CALL THAT GUY? YOU CALL THAT GUY A WINNER. YOU CALL THAT GUY A WINNER. HE'S GOT A GREAT FUTURE IN POLITICS. I JUST GOT TO SAY HEARING UMA TALKING ABOUT GORE IN 2000, WHICH BY THE WAY, AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT.  IT WAS.  REMINDS ME ON THAT MOMENT ON \"MORNING JOE\" WHERE WE ASKED PAT BUCHANAN, AND WE WERE LIKE, PAT, YOU KNOW, AND NIXON KNOWS THAT SAM AND THE DEMOCRATS STOLE ILLINOIS, WHY DIDN'T YOU CHALLENGE IT?  BECAUSE WE STOLE KENTUCKY.  HE THREW A COUPLE OTHER ONES IN.  THE DARK AGES. THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY PAT'S LAUGH AND EVERYTHING. AND DAVID IGNATIUS FROM \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,\" AND HE HAS A GREAT SAYING YOU GO ALL OVER THE WORLD AND TALK TO PEOPLE, AND TWO THINGS ARE TRUE. ONE, THEY LOATHE THE UNITED STATES, AND TWO, MOST OF THEM WANT TO MOVE THERE, RIGHT? THEY STILL LOOK AT US AS THAT CITY SHINING BRIGHTLY ON THE HILL FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE. I DON'T WANT TO GET TOO MELLOW DRAMATIC, AND IT'S NOT THAT THEY CELEBRATE WHEN REPUBLICANS WIN AND DEMOCRATS LOSE, BUT WE ALL KNOW, IN CAPITALS ACROSS EUROPE, IN UKRAINE TODAY, THIS AFTERNOON -- AND I MUST SAY THEY ARE CELEBRATING THIS VICTORY. A GUY IN MOSCOW, AND A LEADER IN BEIJING ARE NOT, BECAUSE THIS IS AMERICA RETURNING TO FORM -- NOT IDEOLOGICALLY, BUT JUST SHOWING WE ARE STILL A DEMOCRACY AND WE ARE GOING TO VOTE OUT ELECTION DENIERS.  GIVES ME CHILLS.  IT WAS A GOOD NIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY, AND A GOOD NIGHT FOR DEMOCRACIES AROUND THE WORLD. AS PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYS THERE'S A CONTEST GOING ON AROUND THE WORLD, BY DEMOCRACIES WHERE YOU GO TO THE POLLS AND SOLVE OR PROBLEMS, AND THEN AUTOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS LIKE CHINA, AND AMERICAN VOTERS, THERE WAS NOT RIOTS AT THE POLLS AND NOT A LOT OF VIOLENCE AT THE POLLS AND PEOPLE TOOK THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES SERIOUSLY, AND GENERALLY MADE GOOD CHOICES. ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING CHOICES IS THE EXIT POLLS SHOW 3 OUT OF 5 AMERICANS THINK WE SHOULD BACK DOWN ON THE SUPPORT OF UKRAINE, AND THEY WERE STEADY. THE WORLD HAS BEEN LOOKING AT US RECENTLY, WONDERING, IS THIS COUNTRY GOING TO CRACK UP? ARE THEY HEADING TOWARDS A CIVIL WAR? AND THINK OF ALL THE ARTICLES YOU READ IN OUR MEDIA, CIVIL WAR IS LOOMING AND VIOLENCE AT THE POLLS?  NOPE.  AND THE WORLD WATCHED CAREFULLY LAST NIGHT AND SAID, YOU KNOW, THIS AMERICA MAY BE A LITTLE STEADIER THAN WE THOUGHT.  YEP, YEP.  AND IN THIS BATTLE AGAINST THE AUTOCRATS, AND MAYBE THE DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES ARE STRONGER THAN WE THOUGHT. THAT'S MY TAKEAWAY.  THAT'S A GREAT TAKEAWAY. I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TO CIRCLE BACK ON SOMETHING, AND WE HAVE NOT TALKED ENOUGH ABOUT JOE BIDEN AND THE WHITE HOUSE, BECAUSE IF DEMOCRATS HAD THE NIGHT WE ALL EXPECTED, EVERYBODY WOULD BE KICKING HIM, THEY WOULD SAY TOO OLD, TOO OUT OF TOUCH AND MADE TOO MANY MISTAKES.  THEY ALWAYS UNDERESTIMATE HIM.  YOU HAVE BEEN UP CLOSE, AND WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING FOR 15 YEARS HERE, WE HAVE BEEN SPORTS ANALYZING --  CHEAP SHEETS. YEAH.  WE DID IT WITH BUSH AND OBAMA. IT'S WHAT WE DO, RIGHT? YOU'VE BEEN THERE. IT'S SO MUCH -- I -- MY PROFESSOR, HE WAS A TENNIS PLAYER AND I WAS CRITICIZING SOMETHING ON TV, AND HE SAID DO YOU KNOW HOW FAST THAT BALL COMES AT THESE PLAYERS, AND UNTIL YOU ARE ON THE FRONT ROW, YOU PROBABLY SHOULD KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO YOURSELF. YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS TO JOE BIDEN THIS MORNING, BECAUSE YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE HEAP CRITICISM BECAUSE VOTERS GO A DIFFERENT WAY. TALK ABOUT JOE BIDEN, WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THIS WHITE HOUSE.  WELL, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE TONE OF THE CONVERSATION ON AIR FORCE ONE, AS IT SHOULD BE, AS THEY HEAD TO CAMBODIA AND GO TO THE G20, BECAUSE WHAT I THINK WHAT EVERYBODY WAS BRACING FOR AND PEOPLE WALKING INTO THE ROOM AND PEOPLE HAVING QUESTIONS IF THIS WAS A LAME DUCK PRESIDENT, AND EVERYTHING HAS NOW CHANGED. EVERYTHING HAS NOW CHANGED. YOU KNOW, I HAVE SO MUCH ADMIRATION FOR THE FACT THAT THESE PEOPLE JUST DID THEIR JOB, AND THEY DIDN'T CARE -- I THINK WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE WE LIKE POLITICIANS WHO ENTERTAIN US AND WHO ARE CHARISMATIC AND DYNAMIC, AND I DON'T DISMISS THE REALLY HISTORIC CANDIDATES WHO WON LIKE WES MOORE, FOR EXAMPLE, AND WE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD THE COALITION TO SUPPORT UKRAINE IF JOE BIDEN WOULD HAVE BEEN OUR PRESIDENT. NOT TO ADD A LITTLE RAIN ON WHAT I THINK IS OTHERWISE A GOOD DAY, AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN -- I THINK CONSEQUENCES ARE IMPORTANT FOR YEARS AND DECADES, AND THIS COUNTRY HAS LED BY EXAMPLE, AND SO NOW THE JANUARY 6th HEARINGS, AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WAS SO SHOCKING TO THE WORLD. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY COULD NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND THE ABORTION ISSUE, AND IT'S SUCH A UNIQUELY AMERICAN THING. YOU GO TO THE MIDDLE EAST WHERE I GREW UP, AND FRANKLY, I KNOW WOMEN WHO HAD ALL KINDS OF THINGS THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE OVER, BUT THEY CAN FULLY GO TO THEIR DOCTOR AND MAKE A CHOICE ABOUT THEIR BODIES, FULL STOP, PERIOD. FOR THEM I THINK THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT -- BUT NOW I HOPE THERE IS SOME WAY TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE.  AND TO FOLLOW-UP ON WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT JOE BIDEN AND THE WAY PEOPLE LOOK AT JOE BIDEN. JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO THE G20 AND THERE WILL BE BAD PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM WITH HIM.  YOU THINK?  THERE ARE GOING TO BE PEOPLE READY TO SNEER AT JOE BIDEN, AND I DON'T WANT TO OVERSTATE THIS, AND REPUBLICANS, IF YOU ARE A TRUMPISTS AND YOU ARE WATCHING AND ANGRY, TOO BAD. THIS IS A REALITY. JOE BIDEN WALKS INTO THAT ROOM, PUTIN, XI, NBS, AND THEY ARE GOING TO LOOK AT A GUY AND GO WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS GUY FOR A COUPLE MORE YEARS BECAUSE HE JUST KICKED DONALD TRUMP'S ASS.  YOU COULD HAVE USED A DIFFERENT WORD.  I COULD HAVE USED -- SORRY PREACHER. I COULD HAVE USED A DIFFERENT WORD, SORRY PRESIDENT --  OH, MAN, SHE'S RIGHT THERE.  HE'S BEEN UP ALL NIGHT.  I CAN'T OVERSTATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT. TALK ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE WHEN BIDEN WALKS INTO THAT ROOM, THESE TYRANTS --  I WISH I COULD SAY YOUR 40s IN RUSSIAN OR CHINESE. I WOULD LOVE TO THINK HOW VLADIMIR PUTIN WILL SAY THAT. IT'S TRUE. THERE'S A PERCEPTION IN THE WORLD THAT CHANGES A LITTLE BIT LAST NIGHT THAT JOE BIDEN IS WEAK, AND THE UNITED STATES IS WEAK, THAT WE'RE UNRELIABLE, AND I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THE LEADERS THAT HAVE TO RECALCULATE THAT, AND THEY HAVE TO SEE THIS PRESIDENT AND THE PARTY HE LEADS AND THE COUNTRY THAT HE LEADS ARE NOT QUITE AS FRAGMENTED AND IN SUCH DISARRAY AS THEY THOUGHT.  AND IMAGINE THE CONVERSATION WE WOULD BE HAVING TODAY IF BRAZIL WOULD HAVE WON --  IT ALSO COMES AT A TIME --  WE SHOULD HAVE HAD A PARTY.  -- THE RUSSIANS ARE STARTING TO CONSIDER TALKING TO US. THEY ARE STARTING TO SAY WAIT A SECOND, MAYBE WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. THEY WILL BE DOING THAT WITH JOE BIDEN HOLDING A VERY STRONG HAND.  EXACTLY, BECAUSE REALITY IS REALITY AND JOE BIDEN IS THE PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT FOR TURNING, HE'S NOT GOING TO SWIRL FROM THIS POLICY.  THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR BEING ON THIS MORNING.  THANK YOU, GUYS.  WE HAVE A LOT TO GET TO.  WE ARE JUST PAST THE TOP OF THE HOUR, AND WE WILL GET BACK TO THE BIG BOARD, AND STEVE KORNACKI IS THERE. STEVE, GIVE US AN UPDATE.  THE BIGGEST OUTSTANDING THING HERE IS THE HOUSE AND SENATE, AND THIS IS THE NBC NEWS PROJECTION ON THE HOUSE RIGHT NOW. YOU CAN SEE WE HAVE IT AT REPUBLICANS LANDING AT 220 SEATS. YOU NEED 218 TO GET A MAJORITY, BUT THE KEY HERE IS THAT IS PLUS OR MINUS TEN SEATS, MEANING THERE'S STILL ROOM FOR REPUBLICANS TO BUILD ON THAT 220 TO GET UP TO 225, TO GET MORE OF A MEATY MAJORITY. TO GET A LOOK AT THE OUTSTANDING ACTION HERE ON THE HOUSE, AND THERE'S AN IRONY TAKING SHAPE AND IT HAS TO DO WITH NEW YORK STATE. WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IN GRAY IS UNCALLED. I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE STATE OF MORNING. WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AS A POSSIBILITY YESTERDAY. IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE IN NEW YORK, KATHY HOCHUL IS ELECTED, AND LEE ZELDIN, WHAT HE DID WAS RUN UP HUGE NUMBERS ON LONG ISLAND, AND ONCE HE GOT NORTH OF WESTCHESTER COUNTY, HE RAN UP BIG NUMBERS IN THE HUDSON VALLEY AND CATSKILLS, AND THIS IS WHERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VULNERABLE DEMOCRATIC HOUSE SEATS, AND ZELDIN HAS JEOPARDIZED UP TO FIVE DEMOCRATIC HELD HOUSE SEATS, AND SOMETHING EXTREMELY IRONIC, I WILL SHOW YOU, JUST GIVE ME A SECOND HERE, AND LONG ISLAND, THE REPUBLICAN IS LEADING HERE, AND THIS SEAT VOTED FOR JOE BIDEN, AND ROBERT ZIMMERMAN CONCEDED THIS RACE, AND THIS IS A DISTRICT THAT VOTED FOR JOE BIDEN BY EIGHT POINTS. THESE ARE TWO REPUBLICAN PICKUPS. THIS IS WHERE IT GETS REALLY INTERESTING. THE 17th DISTRICT, AND NOW YOU ARE IN THE HUDSON VALLEY, AND THIS IS MALONEY, HE'S THE CHAIRMAN OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE AND RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING AND RUNNING DEMOCRATIC CAMPAIGNS FOR THE HOUSE NATIONALLY, AND HE IS WITH ALMOST ALL THE VOTE IN HIS DISTRICT, GOING DOWN TO DEFEAT, AND THIS IS ALMOST THE FIRST TIME IN 42 YEARS THAT A CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE LEADER LOST HIS OR HER OWN DISTRICT, AND THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC LOSS. PAT RYAN WON THE SPECIAL ELECTION IN NEW YORK OVER THE SUMMER, ONLY A FEW VOTES LEFT HERE, BUT A REPUBLICAN AREA STILL TO REPORT, SO A POSSIBILITY THERE FOR THE REPUBLICANS. AND THEN IN THE 19th DISTRICT, THAT REPUBLICAN OVER 6,000 VOTES AHEAD OF THE DEMOCRATS. WHAT I AM SAYING, DEMOCRATS HAVE A CHANCE OF HOLDING THE HOUSE, AND THE DEMOCRATS COULD EVEN END UP GOING DOWN, AND THIS STATE STANDS OUT FROM EVERY OTHER STATE WHERE DEMOCRATS WERE OVER PERFORMING AND WINNING HOUSE RACES THEY WERE NOT EXPECTED TO WIN, AND SUDDENLY IT SEEMS TO HAVE HIT A WALL IN NEW YORK STATE. THESE RACES ARE NOT CALLED YET, BUT POTENTIALLY, THE IRONY OF IRONIES, THAT STRONG ZELDIN RACE COULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO WIN BUT COULD BE ENOUGH TO GIVE REPUBLICANS A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF GAINS IN NEW YORK AND THAT COULD COMPLICATE THE DEMOCRAT'S CHANCE OF RETAINING THE HOUSE. THEY STILL HAVE A CHANCE TO DO THAT. CAN THEY PULL OUT A COUPLE NEW YORK RACES, AND THEN IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE A WHOLE BUNCH OF DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA IN PLAY, AND THERE ARE SIX REPUBLICAN-HELD SEATS IN CALIFORNIA THAT DEMOCRATS ARE TARGETING, AND FOUR OF THEM ARE REPUBLICANS THAT REPRESENT DISTRICTS THAT JOE BIDEN WON IN 2020, AND TWO OTHER THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE A CHANCE IN, AND THE COUNTING IN CALIFORNIA IS SLOW AND IT COULD TAKE WEEKS. WE HAVE ABOUT 30, 40, 50% OF THE VOTE IN THOSE DISTRICTS RIGHT NOW, AND THERE ARE OTHER RACES YOU CAN SEE ARE UNCALLED. DEMOCRATS MAY INBOUND A POSITION WHERE THEY MAY BE HAVING TO RUN THE TABLE, ESSENTIALLY, IN CALIFORNIA. THEY COULD BE -- THEY COULD BE POISED TO TAKE A HIT HERE IN NEW YORK. IT COULD BE IRONIC. THEY HAVE A NIGHT SO MUCH BETTER THAN THEY EXPECTED TO HAVE, AND THEN THE MORNING AFTER WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS CONTROLLING THE HOUSE AND IF THEY DON'T END UP GETTING IT AND FALLING SHORT, IT COULD BE THE HOME OF THE CHAIR IN THE NATIONAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE FROM DOING IT.  IT MAY NOT HAPPEN, BUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE NEXT DAY THE DEMOCRATS HOLDING ON TO THE HOUSE. AND THEN TWO KEY STATES, ARIZONA AND NEVADA, THEY ARE STILL COUNTING THE VOTES OUT THERE. WHAT DOES IT LOOKS LIKE?  IT'S VERY IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THE SENATE MATH BECAUSE THE DEMOCRATS GOT THE PICKUP IN PENNSYLVANIA, AND THAT MEANS THE REPUBLICANS NEED TO GET TWO DEMOCRATIC SEATS. RON JOHNSON IS AHEAD IN WISCONSIN, SO IF RON JOHNSON WERE TO HANG IN THERE, REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE THAT, AND TAKE A LOOK AT ARIZONA AND NEVADA, AND IF GEORGIA GOES TO A RUNOFF, MARK KELLY, THE DEMOCRAT WITH ABOUT 70% OF THE VOTE, HIS MARGIN IS NORTH OF 100,000 VOTES OVER BLAKE MASTERS. WE HAVE THE SAME-DAY VOTE OUT OF MARICOPA COUNTY, AND THAT'S WHERE 60% OF THE VOTES COME FROM, AND OVERNIGHT THEY COUNTED UP THE SAME-DAY VOTES, AND IT BROUGHT MASTERS WITHIN SINGLE DIGITS IN KELLY. WHAT IS STILL TO COME IN MARICOPA COUNTY, AND THE NEXT UPDATE WILL PROBABLY COME TONIGHT AND WE WILL GET NIGHTLY UPDATES IN MARICOPA, AND THIS COULD COME UP TO FIVE DAYS.  OH, COME ON.  AND YOU ARE GOING TO GET INCREMENTAL UPDATES OF THE LATE-ARRIVING EARLY VOTE, AND THAT IS VOTES THAT CAME IN ON SUNDAY, MONDAY AND THE DAY OF THE ELECTION, AND THESE WILL BE REPORTED OUT IN BATCHES. THE SUSPENSE IN ARIZONA IS THIS, IN 2020, THOSE LATE ARRIVING BALLOTS SKEWED HEAVILY REPUBLICANS IN 2018, THERE WAS A DIFFERENT CHARACTER AND FLAVOR TO THE LATE-ARRIVING BALLOTS AND THAT'S WHY KYRSTEN SINEMA WAS ABLE TO GET THAT RACE. WHAT IS THE FLAVOR OF THOSE BALLOTS? ARE THEY LIKE 2020 BALLOTS WHERE THEY FAVOR REPUBLICANS? IF SO MAYBE THERE'S A WORLD WHERE MASTERS CAN COME BACK AND CATCH KELLY IN THIS RACE. HE NEEDS SOMETHING MONSTROUS. BUT ARE THEY MORE LIKE 2018, IN WHICH CASE DEMOCRATS ARE IN FANTASTIC SHAPE IN THE SENATE RACE, AND MASTERS NEEDS TO MAKE UP A LOT SLEEPER HILL TO CLIMB THAN TRUMP FACED IN 2020. IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE, KARI LAKE ONLY NEEDS TO MAKE UP 30,000. A DIFFERENCE OF 75,000 VOTES. LAKE OVER PERFORMING MASTERS. THAT SAME SCENARIO I JUST TOOK YOU THROUGH, IF THOSE ARE REPUBLICAN-FAVORING BALLOTS, MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO GET MASTERS OVER THE TOP, BUT IF THEY ARE REPUBLICAN FLAVORED, THEY COULD GET KARI LAKE OVER THE TOP IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE.  STEVE, BUT IT DEPENDS, LIKE YOU SAID, IF WE FOLLOW WHAT HAPPENS IN 2020 WHEN TRUMP WAS ON THE BALLOT, THIS IS GOOD NEWS FOR KARI LAKE. GOOD NEWS FOR MASTERS, AND HE'S HAVING A HARD TIME CATCHING UP REGARDLESS. IF IT LOOKS LIKE THE LAST OFF-YEAR ELECTION, THOUGH, A DEMOCRATIC YEAR, THEN MAYBE GOOD NEWS FOR KATIE HOBBS, RIGHT?  ABOUT 9:00, WE WILL GET A BIG BATCH -- HOPEFULLY A BIG BATCH FROM MARICOPA, AND THE FIRST OF SEVERAL NIGHTS OF THIS, AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR.  CAN WE GO BACK TO THE SENATE RACE FOR A SECOND, AND YOU SAID FOR PEOPLE WAKING UP TO THE WEST COAST AND MOUNTAIN TIME AND WHATEVER OTHER TIME ZONES ARE OUT THERE, CENTRAL -- I GREW UP IN CENTRAL, SO CENTRAL, AND YOU BROUGHT UP A GREAT POINT. KELLY HAS 106,000 VOTES, AND MASTERS HAS TO MAKE THAT UP. TRUMP MADE UP A LOT OF VOTES BUT HE HAD A MUCH BIGGER ELECTORATE IN 2020 THAT HE COULD DRAW FROM, LIKE MASTERS IS REALLY GOING TO HAVE TO DRAW AN INSIDE STRAIGHT HERE, AND THE NATURE OF THE BALLOTS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE SO REPUBLICAN-LEANING, AND HE'S GOING TO HAVE TO OUT PERFORM TRUMP BECAUSE HE'S OPERATING FROM A MUCH SMALLER UNIVERSE OF VOTERS, RIGHT?  YEAH, AND I AM JUST LOOKING HERE. I CAN GIVE YOU THE NUMBER FROM EXACTLY THIS MOMENT WHERE WE STOOD IN 2020 WHEN WE GOT ALL OF THAT SAME-DAY REPORTED OUT IN MARICOPA COUNTY, AND WE WERE WAITING ON THE EXACT KIND OF THING THAT I AM TALKING ABOUT RIGHT HERE, AND AT THAT POINT IN 2020, JOE BIDEN HAD AN ADVANTAGE OF 94,000 VOTES OVER DONALD TRUMP.  RIGHT.  IT CAME DOWN TO ABOUT 9,700. AGAIN, THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT LEAD FOR KELLY, BUT, AGAIN, THIS IS'S JUST A VARIABLE -- IT'S AN UNKNOWN VARIABLE, UNTIL MARICOPA GIVES US A SENSE OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE. WE HAVE SEEN TWO ELECTIONS NOW, AND IT LOOKED DIFFERENT IN 18 THAN IN 20, AND IT COULD LOOK DIFFERENT THAN '22 THAN IT LOOKED IN '20 OR '18. WE ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO LEARN MUCH MORE IN ARIZONA TODAY. IT WILL BE TONIGHT WHEN MARICOPA SENDS OUT THAT BATCH OF VOTES, AND THAT WILL GIVE US AN IDEA IF MASTERS COULD COME BACK.  BOTTOM LINE FOR MASTERS REGARDLESS, IT'S A VERY STEEP CLIMB. NOT AS STEEP FOR KARI LAKE. IF IT LOOKS LIKE THE 2020 BALLOTS, KARI LAKE MAKES THIS VERY COMPETITIVE. IF IT LOOKS LIKE THE 2018 BALLOTS, THEN DEMOCRATS PROBABLY WIN THE GOVERNORSHIP THERE, RIGHT?  YEAH, IF IT LOOKS LIKE 2020, KARI LAKE WILL WIN THE GOVERNORSHIP, AND IF IT LOOKS LIKE 2018, THE DEMOCRATS WIN BOTH OF THESE THINGS. AND IT COULD BE SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN 2022, BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN TWO DIFFERENT THINGS IN TWO ELECTIONS, BUT THAT'S WHAT WE ARE WAITING ON IN ARIZONA, THE LATE-ARRIVING EARLY BALLOTS. AND THEN IN NEVADA, OVERALL, THAT'S THE CLARK COUNTY VOTE, AND OVER ALL THE REPUBLICAN TOOK THE LEAD OVERNIGHT, AND WHAT WE ARE WAITING ON COMING OUT OF CLARK COUNTY AND WHERE RENO IS, WE ARE WAITING ON LATE-ARRIVING EARLY BALLOTS, AND ALSO DROP BOX VOTES, VOTES PUT IN DROP BOXES YESTERDAY, AND WE ARE TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON HOW MANY VOTES THAT REPRESENTS EXACTLY. WE SUSPECT WHATEVER IT IS IS LIKELY TO FAVOR THE DEMOCRATS, SO THERE COULD BE A PATH THERE FOR CORTEZ AND MASTERS. THERE ARE SOME REPORTS OUT THERE, AND WE HAVE NOT CONFIRMED THEM, BUT THERE'S SOME REPORTS THAT THERE'S A VOLUME OF UNCOUNTED MAIL AND DROP BOX VOTES TO LIFT CORTEZ MASTO. IF YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN, YOUR HOPES ARE MORE ON NEVADA THAN ARIZONA. A BIG PICTURE ON THE SENATE SIDE FOR REPUBLICANS, IF GEORGIA GOES TO A RUNOFF AND JOHNSON HOLDS ON IN WISCONSIN, THEY HAVE TO GET ONE OF THESE TWO, THE REPUBLICANS, THEN THE SENATE CONTROL WOULD COME DOWN TO GEORGIA. IF REPUBLICANS CAN SWEEP ARIZONA AND NEVADA, AND WE STILL MAY HAVE A RUNOFF IN GEORGIA, DEMOCRATS WOULD LOCK UP THE SENATE WITH THOSE TWO.  STEVE, THANKS FOR YOUR GREAT WORK ALL NIGHT LONG. [ APPLAUSE ]  DONNY DEUTSCH, AND MR. MATTHEWS -- CHRIS MATTHEWS, YOU ARE OUR PENNSYLVANIA GUY. WHAT HAPPENED?  WELL, IT'S AN OLD BOBBY KENNEDY EXPRESSION ABOUT YOU HANG A LANTERN ON YOUR PROBLEM, AND HE ASKED FOR THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE ACCOMMODATION, AND PEOPLE LIKED IT AND UNDERSTOOD THE NEED FOR AN ACCOMMODATION, BECAUSE HE HAD A HANDICAP AND A STROKE, AND HE OPENED HIMSELF UP TO THE VOTERS OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND THEY LOOKED AT HIM AND THEN THE ALTERNATIVE, DONALD TRUMP'S CANDIDATE, THE ONE HE PICKED OVER McCORMICK. THE GUY FROM JERSEY. I GREW UP IN PHILADELPHIA, AND THERE WAS A LONG TRAIN OF PEOPLE SITTING IN DECK CHAIRS WATCHING THE PEOPLE COME FROM FROM JERSEY EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT. EVERYBODY KNOWS WHAT DOWN THE SHORE MEANS. IT MEANS FROM JERSEY. SO IN THE END THEY SAID WE ARE GOING TO LOOK OUT FOR OUR OWN GUY HERE, WHATEVER HIS HANDICAPS, UNLIKE TRUMP WHO MAKES FUN OF PEOPLE WITH HANDICAPS AND IT WORKED. I WAS THINKING ABOUT YOU LAST NIGHT, AS I OFTEN DO ON THESE ELECTION NIGHTS, AND YOU SAID AT THE END OF THE DAY WITH ALL THE ISSUES AND POLLING THAT GOES INTO A CAMPAIGN, VOTERS LOOK AND GO, IS HE OR SHE ONE OF US? DOES HE OR SHE REPRESENT US? AND TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THEY LOOKED AT DR. OZ AND SAID HE'S NOT ONE OF US?  HE'S BEEN SLICK, AND IT WAS NOT JUST THE CAPITOL POLICE THAT FOUGHT THE INSURRECTION OR MIKE PENCE, IT WAS THE VOTERS. THEY SAID NO TO IT. THEY SAID WE VOTE TODAY. WE HAVE THE REIGNS TO THE HORSES AND WE DECIDE WHICH DIRECTION THE COUNTRY GOES IN AND THEY SAID NO TO DONALD TRUMP AND HIS REFUSAL THAT HE LOST IN 2020. AND TIM RYAN, WHAT A HERO.  UH-HUH.  AS JOE SAID, WHAT A HERO. HE SAID WHAT TRUMP NEVER SAID. I LOST. THAT'S PART OF THE AMERICAN SYSTEM. WHEN THE VOTERS SPEAK, YOU HAVE TO RESPOND TO THEM. YOU HAVE TO SAY I HEAR YOU, I LOST, I WANTED YOU TO LIKE ME AND YOU LIKED THE OTHER GUY FOR WHATEVER REASON MORE THAN ME, BUT I AM LIVING WITH THAT BECAUSE I AM AN AMERICAN.  WE TEACH OUR KIDS TO DO JUST THAT, TO BE GRACEFUL WINNERS, AND TO BE GOOD LOSERS, AND TO PICK YOURSELF UP AND BRUSH THE DUST OFF OF YOU, SHAKE YOUR OPPONENT'S HAND THAT BEAT YOU, CONGRATULATE THEM, AND WALK ON.  AND HE HAD AN AMAZING CAMPAIGN.  HE RAN A GREAT CAMPAIGN. HE DID JUST THAT. CARLOS, REPUBLICANS --  OKAY. OKAY.  THEY HAD ONE BRIGHT SPOT.  UH-HUH.  VERY SUNNY.  BUT YOU AND I BOTH REPRESENTS THIS STATE IN CONGRESS, AND I THINK WE BOTH UNDERSTAND LAST NIGHT IN FLORIDA, THAT WAS AN EARTHQUAKE.  TWO BIG LOSERS LAST NIGHT, JOE. DONALD TRUMP AND FLORIDA DEMOCRATS. FLORIDA IS NO LONGER A SWING STATE. TAKE IT OFF THE MAP AND COLOR IT RED. IT'S NO LONGER PURPLE AND DEMOCRATS HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT AND ACCEPT THAT GOING INTO 2024. BUT OUTSIDE OF FLORIDA -- BY THE WAY, RON DeSANTIS AND MARCO RUBIO, THEY HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO TRUMP AND THEY NEVER EMBRACED TRUMP'S LIE. I THINK WE SAW THIS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. TICKET SPLINTERS PUNISHED THOSE THAT EMBRACED TRUMP'S LIE, AND REWARDED OTHERS WHO DID NOT. AND THIS ELECTION IS FUNDAMENTALLY ABOUT TRUST, AND WE TALKED ABOUT INFLATION AND CRIME AND ABORTION, AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, THE TICKET SPLITTERS THAT DECIDED A LOT OF THE RACES SAID WE ARE GOING TO PUNISH PEOPLE WHO ARE LYING TO US. WE CALL THEM ELECTION DENIERS, AND THEY ARE JUST LIARS.  REMARKABLE, ISN'T IT?  IN NEW YORK, WE HAD LEE ZELDIN, WHO IS A ELECTION DENIER, AND HE HAS YET TO CONCEDE TO KATHY HOCHUL, AND THERE ARE STILL ELECTION DENIERS WHO WON LAST NIGHT AND THERE ARE A LOT OF AMERICANS THAT SUPPORTED THEM, AND IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS WE HAVE TO SEE HOW THAT MOVES FORWARD. REPUBLICANS HAVE A TRUMP PROBLEM AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE THE INTRA-PARTY FIGHTING.  YEAH, KATHY HOCHUL HANGS ON THE GOVERNOR'S RACE IN WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN.  THAT WAS A ROUGH RIDE.  THERE ARE HOUSE RACES, AND YOU CAN GO DOWN THE BALLOT WHERE ELECTION DENIERS RAN AND WERE DEFEATED. WHAT DID YOU SEE LAST NIGHT?  THIS ENDED UP BEING A REFERENDUM ON CRAZY. WAS IT A REFERENDUM ON JANUARY 6th, ELECTION DENIERS, AND ON ABORTION RIGHTS, CRAZINESS. IT BECAME A REFERENDUM ON CRAZY. AMERICA --  WE TALKED ABOUT WEIRDOS, FREAKS AND RESURRECTIONISTS.  PROFESSOR, WE NOW LAUNCHED WHAT I THINK IS ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING SHOWS ON EARTH, THE RON AND DON SHOW. DeSANTIS IS ASCENDING AND DONALD TRUMP IS DESCENDING. AND DONALD TRUMP MAY NOT GO AWAY, AND HE COULD BE RALPH NADER. YOU CAN SEE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I HEARD THIS FROM A BIG DONOR, DeSANTIS' PEOPLE ARE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT HIM BUT IN -- THE DEMOCRATS ARE UNITED. THERE'S GOING TO BE A CIVIL WAR IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT GO AWAY. THAT'S THEIR PROBLEM.  WILLIE, WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING HIM FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE, ESPECIALLY WITH HIM FACING INDICTMENTS, HIM JUST QUIETING GOING AWAY AND SAYING I WILL FIGHT THE DOJ ON MY OWN. HE WANTS TO ANNOUNCE SO HE CAN SAY I AM BEING PERSECUTED, IT'S A WITCH HUNT.  OF COURSE DONNY IS RIGHT. IT'S A LOT OF WISH CASTING FOR THE REPUBLICANS, HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. HIS BRAND OF CAMPAIGNING AND BRAND OF EXTREMISM WAS ON THE BALLOT LAST NIGHT AND IT LOST. TO YOUR POINT, CARLOS, ABOUT DeSANTIS, I HAD A REPUBLICAN STRATEGISTS TEXT ME LAST NIGHT AND SAY, ANYBODY THAT WATCHED LAST NIGHT AND WATCHED RON DeSANTIS TRANSFORM THE STATE OF FLORIDA TO WIN MIAMI-DADE COUNTY AND LATINO VOTERS, AND WATCH DONALD TRUMP AND STILL PICKS DONALD TRUMP OVER DeSANTIS, IS JUST A CULTISTS AT THIS POINT, AND THAT WAS A REPUBLICAN SAYING THAT. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO SEE THE STAGE.  THE DeSANTIS TEAM COULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN A BETTER SCRIPT FOR LAST NIGHT.  OH, YEAH.  THE PROBLEM IS, THAT SHOW IS ENDING AND WE OPEN UP THE NEW CHAPTER WHERE DONALD TRUMP'S GOAL IS TO GOING TO BE DESTROY RON DeSANTIS, RON DeSANTIS AND MITCH McCONNELL, THOSE TWO WILL BE RECEIVING DONALD TRUMP'S FIRE FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND WE WILL SEE HOW THEY DEAL WITH IT.  IT WILL PROBABLY START TODAY. CHRIS MATTHEWS, TALK ABOUT HOW WE NEVER KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN ON ELECTION DAY. POLLSTERS DO THEIR BEST, AND OVER THE LAST COUPLE CYCLES, THEY OVERLOOKED RIGHT WING POPULISTS, AND LAST NIGHT IT WAS YOUNGER VOTERS AND WOMEN WHO WERE MOTIVATED, AND MEN WHO LOVE WOMEN WHO CARED ABOUT ABORTION, WHO CARED ABOUT THE RIGHT THAT WOMEN HAD HAD FOR 50 YEARS THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY, AND THEY WERE THE ONES. IF YOU LOOKED AT THE POLLS BEFORE AND EXIT POLLS, THEY ARE THE ONES THAT POLLSTERS UNDERESTIMATED GREATLY LAST NIGHT. WHAT A DIFFERENCE THEY MADE.  SO TRUE. YOU KNOW, PUNDITRY AND POLLING, ALL OF THOSE HAVE THEIR ROLE UNTIL THE FIRST VOTES ARE COUNTED, AND THEN WE HEAR FROM THE PEOPLE. THE VOTERS GET TO DECIDE. THEY ARE THE LEADERS. THE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO WALK INTO THE VOTING BOOTH AND EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO FREE SPEECH AND TO PICKING LEADERS, THEY ARE THE ONES WHO DECIDE THE COUNTRY. THEY RULE THE COUNTRY. THAT'S THE POWER OF ELECTION DAY.  YEAH.  VOTERS ARE THE BOSSES, THE BIG BOSSES. THEY TELL US WHAT THEY THINK, AND THAT RULES THE COUNTRY. WE'LL FIND OUT WHO RULES THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, BUT WE HAVE HEARD FROM THE VOTERS AND IT'S NOT WHAT THE PUNDITS HAD, WHAT I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. THE FEAR I HAD WAS OVER THE TOP. I THOUGHT THIS COULD BE A DISASTER, AND YET THE VOTERS SAID, NO, WE CARE ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION, AND WE CARE ABOUT LIZ CHENEY AND PROTECTING OUR RIGHT FOR CHOICE, AND WE ARE A COUNTRY OF FREEDOM AND ELECTIONS. FREEDOM AND ELECTIONS, THEY WORK TOGETHER. WITH OUR FREEDOM WE CAN VOTE AND WITH OUR VOTE WE PROTECT OUR FREEDOM, AND THEY WORK TOGETHER AND THE VOTERS EXERCISED THEIR RIGHTS TO RULE A COUNTRY.  CHRISTINA GREER, THE POLLING MADE ONE THINK ABORTION WAS NOT TOP OF MIND, BUT WOMEN TURNED OUT, AND MANY MEN WHO CARE ABOUT THAT ISSUE AND EVEN PLACES LIKE KENTUCKY, WHAT HAPPENED?  JOE MADE AN INTERESTING POINT, IT'S NOT JUST WOMEN. IT'S MEN WHO CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE. IF REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING LIFE BEGINS AT CONCEPTION, AND THEN IS MY SON ON THE HOOK FOR PARENTAL SUPPORT FROM CONCEPTION? I THINK THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE FINANCIAL RAMIFICATIONS AS WELL, AND NOTHING TO SAY A WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IF SHE'S 10 YEARS OLD OR 40 YEARS OLD, AND THIS IS A CONVERSATION ABOUT CHOICE. IT'S NOT ABOUT PRO LIFE. AND WE HAVE SEEN REPUBLICANS WHO ARE PRO DEATH PENALTY AND THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT, AND THESE ARE A HOST OF ISSUES THAT ARE ABOUT LIFE, AND THEY ARE WANTING HELP WITH THE POCKETBOOK ISSUES.  WE ARE GOOD GUYS. IT'S THE SOUND BITE THAT WILL LIVE THROUGH HISTORY, THAT'S TIM RYAN. THAT IS WHO WE ARE, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY VERSUS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AND IF YOU WERE NOT MOVED BY THAT, THEN YOU DON'T FEEL WHAT IS GREAT ABOUT US. TO ME THAT IS THE SOUND BITE THAT --  HE WAS MAKING AN IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT AMERICA AND THIS DEMOCRACY. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH FOR BEING ON THIS MORNING. AHEAD ON \"MORNING JOE,\" JAMES CARVILLE WILL JOIN US. AND THEN SPENDING MILLIONS TO PROMOTE SOME OF THE MORE EXTREME CANDIDATES IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARIES, AND WE WILL LOOK AT IF THAT STRATEGY PAID OFF. AND THEN JEWEL IS OUR GUEST THIS MORNING. SHE HAS A NEW INITIATIVE ABOUT RAISING AWARENESS AROUND MENTAL HEALTH. YOU ARE WATCHING \"MORNING JOE.\" WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. > MACHINE ACTUAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ARE FOR --  HALF THE MURDERS IN PHILADELPHIA, WE HAVE TO GET MENTAL SERVICES TO THESE PEOPLE.  WHAT I DO KNOW IS THIS, AND THAT IS WE AS A STATE AND WE AS A SOCIETY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB WITH MENTAL HEALTH.  WELL BEYOND THE THREAT POSED BY SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, JUST THE FACT THAT THE LARGEST IN-PATIENT MENTAL HEALTH CARE FACILITY IN A STATE OF 30 MILLION PEOPLE IS THE HARRIS COUNTY JAIL IN DOWNTOWN HOUSTON, TEXAS, AND WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT OUR PRIORITIES ARE AND WHAT WE VALUE IN THIS STATE.  WE WILL FOCUS ON THE MOST SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IDENTIFIED HERE IN THE SUBWAYS, AND NOT ONLY WILL THIS PROVIDE HELP FOR THEM BUT WILL ALLEVIATE THE FEAR OF MANY OF OUR RIDERS TODAY.  ALL RIGHT. AND SHE WON. SO MENTAL HEALTH HAS BEEN A KEY ISSUE FOR MANY CANDIDATES DURING THESE MID-TERM ELECTIONS WITH ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SUICIDE RATES CURRENTLY AT HISTORIC HIGHS IN THIS COUNTRY, AND NOT HELPFUL THAT COVID IMPACTED ALL THIS. AND HALF OF AMERICANS NOT HAVING ACCESS, AND THIS MORNING THERE'S A NEW RESOURCE. GRAMMY-NOMINATED AND MULTI-PLATINUM SONGWRITER AND SINGER, JEWEL, A CHALLENGE, PROVIDING PROVEN TOOLS FOR MENTAL HEALTH THROUGHOUT THE HOLIDAY SEASON. MORE THAN 120 LEADERS, EXECUTIVES, CELEBRITIES AND ATHLETES AND MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS ARE COMING TOGETHER TO HELP PARTICIPATE IN THIS CAMPAIGN, AND JOE, YOU AND I ARE AS WELL. IT'S THE NOT ALONE CHALLENGE. IT INSPIRES PEOPLE TO CREATE SHORT VIDEOS SHARING SUPPORT AND ADVOCACY FOR MENTAL HEALTH THAN CHALLENGE AND TAG TWO FRIENDS AND PARTICIPATE AND SHARE THEIR STORIES. THERE'S ALSO AN ONLINE AUCTION THAT FUNDS -- THE FUNDS GO TO SUPPORT JEWEL'S NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION, THE INSPIRING CHILDREN'S FOUNDATION, AND JEWEL IS HERE BETWEEN ME AND JOE ON SET, AND IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU IN PERSON.  I HAVE BEEN A BIG FAN.  I LOVE WHAT YOU ARE DOING.  THANK YOU.  IT'S PERSONAL FOR YOU.  YEAH, I MOVED OUT AT 15 AND GREW UP IN A ABUSIVE HOME, AND IF HAPPINESS IS NOT TAUGHT AT HOME, IS IT A TEACHABLE SKILL, AND 50% OF PEOPLE THAT NEED THESE TYPES OF TOOLS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THEM.  LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO MIKA ABOUT A COUPLE YEARS NOW GOING, CAN WE CREATE AN APP OR CREATE SOMETHING CALLED COMMUNITY, BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO ISOLATED.  ESPECIALLY IN COVID.  YEAH, ESPECIALLY DURING COVID, AND THAT'S WHAT YOU ARE DOING, THERE'S LONELINESS OUT THERE, AND UNFORTUNATELY, SO MANY PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS, DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET THE TYPE OF HELP THEY NEED.  YEAH, WE CAN'T SCALE THERAPISTS QUICKLY ENOUGH, SO FINDING PROVEN ONES THAT ARE SKILL ORIENTED, AND IT'S JUST BASED ON SCIENCE, THE TOOLS THAT WE CAN GET.  THERE ARE A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH DESERTS. IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES. ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SUICIDAL IDEALIZATIONS, AND SUICIDE, ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS GOING UP.  YEAH, EVERYBODY IS TOUCHED BY IT. WE ARE SEEING IT ACROSS EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC AND AGE GROUP AND SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUND, AND ONE OF THE ISSUES IS MAKING SURE WE HAVE RESOURCES TAILORED TO THOSE COUNTRIES, AND YOU NEED SOMEBODY THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU THAT HELP WITH THESE PROBLEMS.  I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU ARE DOING FOR CHILDREN.  YEAH, WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR 20 YEARS WHEN NOBODY REALLY CARED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH. THE GOOD NEWS IS OVER THE 20 YEARS, WE CULTIVATED A TOOL KIT THAT HELPS, AND I THINK WE ARE THE ONLY FREE ONE WITH THOSE TYPES OF TOOLS.  WE HAVE A DOCTOR THAT WORKS ON THIS THAT IS IN OUR AUDIENCE TODAY.  YES.  YOU GUYS DID THIS TOGETHER.  YEAH.  IT'S THE NOT ALONE CHALLENGE. WE'RE DOING IT.  YAY.  JEWEL, THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS. ON THIS DAY, WE NEEDED TO SETTLE, AND WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE WORSE, RIGHT? UP NEXT, YOU WILL BE GRABBING YOUR GUITAR AND BE PERFORMING ONE OF YOUR SONGS, AND THAT'S AHEAD. AND FIRST, LET'S GET AN UPDATE ON PETER ALEXANDER ON WHERE THINGS STAND THIS MORNING AFTER THE MIDTERMS.  THIS MORNING CONTROL OF CONGRESS UP IN THE AIR WITH THE HOUSE AND SENATE STILL HANGING IN THE BALANCE. REPUBLICANS ACKNOWLEDGING THE EXPECTED RED WAVE NEVER MATERIALIZED.  DEFINITELY NOT A REPUBLICAN WAVE, THAT'S FOR SURE.  ON IT HAS NOT BEEN AS BIG OF A WAVE I HOPED IT WOULD BE.  DEMOCRATS ARE CELEBRATING A CRITICAL SENATE PICKUP IN PENNSYLVANIA. WHERE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, FETTERMAN, JUST MONTHS REMOVED FROM A STROKE DEFEATED HIS REPUBLICAN RIVAL, CELEBRITY TV DOCTOR, MEHMET OZ.  FOR ANYBODY THAT WAS KNOCKED DOWN AND GOT BACK UP --  AND GEORGIA COULD BE HEADED TO A RUNOFF NEXT MONTH IF RAPHAEL WARNOCK OR HERSCHEL WALKER COULD NOT REACH THE 50% THRESHOLD.  YOU ALL JUST HANG IN THERE. I'M FEELING GOOD.  I SAID HE'S GOING TO BE TOUGH TO BEAT.  DEMOCRATS SHOWED SIGNS OF STRENGTH IN A NUMBER OF KEY RACES.  HATS OFF TO THE DEMOCRATS.  TWO DEMOCRATIC SENATORS, MAGGIE HASSAN, WITH NARROW VICTORIES.  THANKS TO YOUR COMMITMENT AND HARD WORK, WE HAVE WON THIS RACE.  CRITICAL WINS FOR THE GOP HOLDING ON TO A KEY SENATE SEAT IN NORTH CAROLINA, AND IN OHIO, J.D. VANCE BEATING DEMOCRAT, TIM RYAN. VANCE WAS ENDORSED BY FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP.  I WILL NEVER FORGET THE GREAT PEOPLE OF OHIO.  A MAJOR BRIGHT SPOT FOR THE GOP, FLORIDA, GOVERNOR RON DeSANTIS AND MARCO RUBIO CRUISING TO ELECTION, AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, VOTERS SENDING A MESSAGE THEY ARE DISSATISFIED WITH PRESIDENT BIDEN AND THE ECONOMY. ABORTION RIGHTS WAS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE, AND A HUGE MOTIVATING FACTOR FOR DEMOCRATS. NOW BOTH PARTIES FACING A DEEPLY DIVIDED ELECTORATE AHEAD OF THE NEXT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. > HERE NOW TO PERFORM AN ACUE STICK VERSION OF MONTH MORE TEARS, JEWEL. \u266a \u266a LORD KNOWS YOU CAN'T LOSE ALL OF THE TIME \u266a \u266a SO DRY THOSE PRETTY EYES \u266a \u266a LIFT UP THAT PROUD FACE, CAUSE I CAN STILL SEE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE THERE ARE FOR YOU NOW \u266a \u266a LOVE IS A MYSTERY \u266a \u266a BUT I STILL SEE ITS SHIENG FACE \u266a \u266a THERE ARE NO MORE SAD SONGS, JUST BLUE SKIES \u266a \u266a THERE ARE NO MORE TEARS TO CRY \u266a \u266a AS LONG AS THERE'S A CHILD'S LAUGHTER AND A STARRY SKY \u266a \u266a AND A BEATING IN MY CHEST THERE'S A WILLINGNESS TO TRY \u266a \u266a AS LONG AS I SEE POETRY AND ORDINARY THINGS \u266a \u266a YOU KNOW I WILL, I WILL, I WILL SEE LOVE'S, OH, LOVE'S SHINING FACE \u266a \u266a THERE ARE NO MORE SAD SONGS, JUST BLUE SKIES \u266a \u266a THAT'S YOU SHOULDLY WHERE PEOPLE CLAP BECAUSE IT WAS PRETTY AMAZING, THANK YOU \u266a THERE ARE NO MORE TEARS, SWEETHEART \u266a \u266a THERE ARE NO MORE TEARS \u266a \u266a THERE ARE NO MORE TEARS TO CRY \u266a > JEWEL.

        "trs": "NOW, A PRIVILEGE, AS SOMEONE WHO WAS THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE, I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TO CONCEDE THIS WAYS TO J.D. VANCE, BECAUSE THE WAY THIS COUNTRY OPERATES IS THAT WHEN YOU LOSE AN ELECTION, YOU CONCEDE, AND YOU -- RESPECT -- [ APPLAUSE ] -- YOU RESPECT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. RIGHT? WE CAN'T HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE IF YOU WIN, IT'S A LEGITIMATE ELECTION, AND IF YOU LOSE, SOMEONE STOLE IT. THAT IS NOT HOW WE CAN MOVE FORWARD IN THE UNITED STATES. [ APPLAUSE ]  CONGRESSMAN TIM RYAN CONCEDING THE RACE, LOST TO REPUBLICAN J.D. VANCE IN A HARD-FOUGHT RACE. THAT SHOULD BE AN EXTRAORDINARY ACT BUT IN THESE TIMES IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY ACT AND IMPORTANT ACT. SAID IT WAS A PRIVILEGE TO LOSE TO A GUY THAT HE FEELS LIKE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO REPRESENT THE STATE OF OHIO BUT THIS IS THE WAY IT WORKS. FOUGHT FOR A YEAR AND A HALF AND LOST. CONCEDE THE RACE AND MOVE ON.  YEAH. NO. YOU'RE RIGHT. BY THE WAY, I THINK THIS IS A GUY WHO RAN A GREAT RACE.  INCREDIBLE RACE.  RAN AS GOOD A RACE AS YOU CAN. ALWAYS A BIG BELIEVE WERER USUALLY THE BETTER POLITICAL ATHLETE WINS. THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN HERE. J.D. VANCE, AND I'M NOT PILING ON THIS MORNING, BUT TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE. GOP DON'T-ERS, ACTIVISTS, SAY HE WAS THE LAZIEST WORST WOULD CANDIDATE THEY'VE EVER SEEN. INSULT DONORS AT ROUNDTABLE MEETINGS, PETULANT, LAZY. DIDN'T LIKE CAMPAIGNING, AND WHY IS THIS IMPORTANTEN TO BRING UP? IT'S IMPORTANT TO BRING UP, BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT FLORIDA AND OHIO ARE TWO STATES DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO THINK LONG AND HARD ABOUT BEFORE INVESTING A DIME THEIR IN '24. THEY CAN REBUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE, BUT RIGHT NOW, TEXAS, OHIO AND FLORIDA, PLEASE -- DEMOCRATS -- DEMOCRATS -- IT'S FOOLS' GOLD. ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT. FOCUS ON WISCONSIN, MICHIGAN, PENNSYLVANIA, GEORGIA, ARIZONA. 270 -- BUT THEY ALWAYS SAY, YOU KNOW, NEXT YEAR, TEXAS IS GOING TO SWING -- NO. LET ME JUST SAY, ALSO, TIM RYAN RAN A GREAT RACE. A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE PILING ON BETO. BETO RUNS GREAT RACES. PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, GOT OFF TO A TOUGH START, BUT HIS STATE-WIDE RACES ARE THINGS TO ADMIRE. HE GOES, HE CAMPAIGNS, HE GOES ACROSS THE STATE, HE CONFRONTS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, HE WAS RUNNING UPHILL NONSTOP.  THE WHOLE TIME.  THE WHOLE TIME. SO I HAVE NOTHING BUT GREAT THINGS TO SAY ABOUT BETO. HE LOST. HE RAN A GREAT CAMPAIGN.  SAME WITH TIM RYAN.  YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT? IT JUST -- IT'S NOT A DEMOCRATIC STATE YET.  IT'S NOT A DEMOCRATIC STATE, AND THE LIST YOU GAVE, THE ONLY ONE I WOULD CARVE OUT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TRACKING TEXAS SINCE I WAS A STATE PARTY CHAIRMAN, IS TEXAS. DEMOCRATS HAVE DONE A VERY EFFECTIVE JOB OF WINNING CULTURE TO THE GROUND IN TEXAS. IT'S A PROCESS. EVERYONE THINKS THAT YOU, YOU TURN THESE STATES OVERNIGHT. YOU DON'T. YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE VOTERS TO GO OUTSIDE THEIR COMFORT ZONE AND VOTE FOR THE OPPOSITE PARTY, WHEN MY DADDY'S LOOKING AT ME LIKE I'M CRAZY. RIGHT? I'M DOING IT. BUT THEY'VE DONE A GOOD JOB WINNING MAYOR'S RACES, CITY COUNCIL RACES, SHERIFF'S RACES SLOWLY MAKING THAT TURN. I STILL SAY BY THE TIME WE GET TO 2028, TEXAS WILL BE A BATTLEGROUND STATE IN THIS COUNTRY FOR A HOST OF REASONS. MAYBE NOT IN '24.  RIGHT.  BUT THE TREND LINES ARE THERE. FLORIDA IS RED. WHERE DEMOCRATS FREED TO RECALIBRATE IS FLORIDA. I WOULD NOT SAY TEXAS.  THEY NEED TO RE -- FROM THE GROUND UP. THE THING ABOUT TEXAS THAT'S FASCINATING IS, OF COURSE, THE DALLAS SUBURBS BREAKING BLUE. A LOT OF MY FRIENDS I SERVED WITH IN THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS GOT WIPED 0 UT IN THE SUBURBS OF DALLAS. WHEN I WAS THERE, THOSE WERE THE SAFEST SEATS. RIGHT, BUT I SAW A \"NEW YORK TIMES\" MAP. FASCINATING. THROW THIS OUT TO BOTH OF YOU GUYS. HEARING NONSTOP ALL THE HISPANICS, BECAUSE HISPANIC MEN LOVE MACHO LEADERSER. THEY'RE A BAD THING TO THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THIS IS HISTORIC TEXAS, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. YOU LOOK AT THAT NOW. ALONG THE BORDER, IT'S BLUE THIS YEAR. IT'S BLUE. IF DEMOCRATS CONSOLIDATE. BY THE WAY, OH, WE HEARD, OH, THE BORDER, HISPANICS, GOT TATTOOS OF DONALD TRUMP ON THEIR CHEST. NO. NO. THEY HELD THEIR OWN ALONG THE BORDER, AND THEY DID WELL IN DALLAS SUBURBS. THAT IS SOMETHING TO BUILD ON, EVEN THOUGH BETO, WHO GOT BEATEN BADLY LAST NIGHT.  LOOK, PUT FLORIDA OVER HERE AND WHEN DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR COME TO JESUS MEETING, FLORIDA WILL BE A BIG DISCUSSION POINT. FINE. REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE DONALD TRUMP, FEELS MORE PROBLEMATIC OR HARDER, BUT THE HISPANIC GROUP ACROSS THE COUNTRY IS NOT THE SAME IN EVERY STATE. THIS NOTION JUST BECAUSE IN FLORIDA WHERE THE HISPANIC POPULATION IS OLDER. SOCIALISM DOESN'T REALLY PLAY THERE, BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF FIRST GENERATIONS, SECOND GENERATION.  SOCIALISM.  EXACTLY. IT DOESN'T SOUND OR FEEL GOOD.  RIGHT.  AND THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF SPANISH LANGUAGE DISINFORMATION ADS RUN IN FLORIDA PRIMARILY. OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, THE HISPANIC VOTE IS YOUNG, IT'S DEMOCRATIC AND YOUNG.  OVERWHELMINGLY.  OVERWHELMINGLY IN STATES LIKE NEVADA AND STATES -- THE BORDER, AS YOU SAID. IN STATES LIKE ARIZONA. THIS IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR DEMOCRATS, AND THERE'S NO INDICATION IT'S MOVING TOWARDS REPUBLICAN ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  A DISTRICT FLIPPED BACK, BY THE WAY. HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS, THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE AN EXAMPLE OF THE RED WAVE FOR HISPANICS. NOT EVEN CLOSE.  WELL, YEAH. BECAUSE I THINK A SENSE THAT, IF THERE WAS GOING TO BE A RED WAVE WERE, YOU WOULD SEE MASSIVE NON-COLLEGE MOVEMENT PARTICULARLY AMONG BLACK AND BROWN MEN TO REPUBLICANS. AND I THINK OUTSIDE OF FLORIDA, THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THAT AT ALL. LISTEN, I AGREE WITH MICHAEL. IT TAKES A GENERATION TO TURN A STATE FROM A, RED STATE TO A BLUE STATE. BLUE STATE TO RED STATE, BUT TEXAS IS ON THAT TRA IT TRAJECTORY. THIS COMPLETELY CHANGES IT.  LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN FLORIDA. IS THAT A RON DeSANTIS PHENOMENON? A SOUTH FLORIDA PHENOMENON? LOST MIAMI-DADE 20 POINTS FOUR YEARS AGO AND FLIPPED LATINO VOTE BY 20 POINTS IN THIS FAVOR.  I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER SEEN A BIG AMERICAN COUNTY MOVE THAT QUICKLY. IT'S A MASSIVE CHANGE. I DON'T THINK IT'S DeSANTIS. I THINK HE'S GOT STRENGTH DOWN THERE, NO QUESTION. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE MOVED IN TO TEXAS. I THINK A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE REPUBLICAN VOTERS. AND, LISTEN, A LOT'S CHANGED. REMEMBER, WHEN OBAMA WON FLORIDA IN '12, WON BY 50,000 VOTES BASICALLY TIED THE CUBAN VOTE. A BIG CHANGE THERE. BUT DeSANTIS HAS A STORY TO TELL. I THINK THE STORY HE AND HIS TEAM WILL TELL REPUBLICANS IS LOOK WHAT HAPPENED IN THE OASIS OF FLORIDA. I CAN DO THAT FOR THE COUNTRY. A LOT A B.S. BUT A LOT OF STORIES TO TELL. DONALD TRUMP LICKING WOUNDS IN MAR-A-LAGO.  CAN COMES DOWN TO NUMBERS TOO TOO, WILLIE. TALKING ABOUT ALL THE PEOPLE THAT MOVED INTO FLORIDA, DURING COVID, PRE AND POST-COVID. IN 2018 WHEN DeSANTIS ALMOST LOST, DEMOCRATS HAD ABOUT A 250,000 REGISTRATION ADVANTAGE. RIGHT? THIS ELECTION, REPUBLICANS FOR THE FIRST TIME WENT AHEAD AND DIDN'T JUST GO AHEAD BY A COUPLE VOTES. REPUBLICANS, THERE ARE ABOUT 350,000 MORE REPUBLICANS THAN DEMOCRATS. LIKE A 500,000 IT 600,000 VOTE REGISTRATION SWING. SO JUST ALL OF THE TREND LINES ARE MASSIVE THERE, AND BY THE WAY, IT'S -- THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT SO HARD TO COME BACK.  TRUE FOR SURE AND ALSO IN DeSANTIS'S CASE, VOTERS LIKED THE WAY HE HANDLED COVID. OPENING SCHOOLS QUICKER, AND HANDLED HURRICANE IAN A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. AND VICTORY SPEECH, A LOT ABOUT A FIGHT AGAINST WOKISM. MOVE TO FLORIDA IF YOU WANT TO LIVE IN A FREE SOCIETY. THAT RESONATED WITH A LOT OF VOTERS.  YEAH.  BACK TO THE POINT WHAT REPUBLICANS DO NEXT. IF ANYONE THINKS THERE'S GOING TO BE A GRAND MEETING AT THE CAPITOL HILL CLUB OF REPUBLICAN INTELLIGENCE AROUNDEN DONALD TRUMP, IT AIN'T HAPPENING. THE REALITY OF IT IS, DESPITE THE LOSSES, AND IN SOME CASES MASSIVE IN TERMS OF THE RESOURCES THAT WERE PUT INTO WINNING THOSE RACES, DONALD TRUMP STILL HAS A FIRM GRIP ON A LOT OF THE GOP, AND HIS -- AND HIS MESSAGING AND HIS ABILITY TO ANIMATE THE BASE IN A WAY, IT'S GOING TO BE A REAL TEST FOR SOMEONE LIKE DeSANTIS BEYOND FLORIDA. THAT'S THE NEXT GREAT BATTLE TO COME. YOU SAW THE PRESIDENT COIN THE, RON DESANCTIMONIOUS WHICH ACTUALLY, MORE TO COME.  MORE TO COME.  RIGHT. SO YOU BEGIN TO SEE, TO YOUR POINT, THAT THE LINES ARE GOING TO BE DRAWN WITHIN THE GOP OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, BECAUSE THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CYCLE BEGINS TOMORROW.  SOME WOULD SAY, IF THAT IS IN FACT THE CASE AND REPUBLICANS STILL, YOU KNOW, STILL HANG TIGHT WITH DONALD, I CAN TELL YOU, A LOT OF DEMOCRATS SAYING, GOOD. BECAUSE HE LOST IN '17, IN '18, LOST IN '19, LOST IN '20, AND I'VE GOT TO SAY, WE'LL HEAR A LOT ABOUT THIS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS. IN IS NO WAY FOR US TO ADEQUATELY EXPLAIN TO YOU JUST HOW HISTORIC LAST NIGHT WAS.  YES.  IN AN OFF-YEAR ELECTION, NEVER SEEN ANYTHING -- YOU COULD LOOK AT 2002. RIGHT AFTER 9/11. LOOK AT '98 AFTER IMPEACHMENT. THOSE DON'T COME CLOSE TO WHAT HAPPENS HERE. WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT HAS NOT HAPPENED IN OUR LIFETIME, ANDEN PROVING -- WE'RE GOING TO GO TO BREAK BUT WE DO NEED TO TALK ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT WATCH IN THE MORNING.  BRACE YOURSELF, SWEET WOULDY.  AND THEY BITCH AT ME WHEN I COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WHITE HOUSE. PROVING WHAT JOHN KENNEDY SAID AFTER BAY OF PIGS. SUCCESS HAS MANY FATHERS BUT FAILURE IS AN ORPHAN. SUCTION HAS MANY FATHERS THIS MORNING AND WE HAVE YET TO TALK ABOUT THE ONE MAN EVERYBODY WOULD HAVE BLAMED IF REPUBLICANS HAD A GOOD NIGHT, AND THAT IS JOE BIDEN.  HMM.  ALL WE'VE HEARD IS HIS LOW APPROVAL RATINGS, WANTING TO DRAG DOWN --  IT'S TRUE.  HE'S TOO OLD. HE'S TOO OUT OF TOUCH. HE'S TOO UNPOPULAR. THIS IS GOING TO BE A MASSIVE LOSS FOR JOE BIDEN. NOT EVEN CLOSE.  WE'LL TALK ABOUT ALL OF THAT NEXT BLOCK. DAVID PLOUFFE, JEN PSAKI, THANK YOU FOR STARTING US OFF. > COMING OFF A BIG WIN LAST NIGHT, THE SENATOR FROM COLORADO OUR GUEST. WE'RE BACK WITH MUCH MORE ON THIS VERY SPECIAL EDITION OF \"MORNING JOE,\" AFTER THE ELECTION.  WE FIGHT THE WOKE AND THE LEGISLATURE. WE FIGHT THE WOKE AND THE SCHOOLS. WE FIGHT THE WOKE IN THE CORPORATIONS. WE WILL NEVER, EVER, SURRENDER TO THE WOKE MOB. FLORIDA IS WHERE WOKE GOES TO DIE!  PEOPLE HAVE COME HERE BECAUSE OUR POLICIES WORK. SLEEDERSHIP MATTERS. WE REFUSE TO USE POLLS AND PUT OUR FINGER IN THE WIND. LEADERS DON'T FOLLOW. THEY LEAD. [ APPLAUSE ] > 46 PAST THE HOUR. WELCOME TO A SPECIAL EDITION OF \"MORNING JOE.\" GOING OVER ELECTION RESULTS.  THE SPECIAL THIS MORNING?  I DO. I FEEL LIKE, WHAT WAS OUR MOTTO YESTERDAY? PUT IT ON THE MUGS? A GOOD ONE. ALL OF THIS IS WRONG.  ALL OF THIS IS WRONG.  YES, IT WAS.  OUR WAY TO COVER OURSELVES BECAUSE WE SAID YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN ELECTIONS.  POLLS VERSUS THE EXIT POLLS.  RIGHT. EVERYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW THIS WAS GOING TO BE A MASSIVE --  CRIME, CRIME, CRIME.  REPUBLICAN THING. AND WE WERE SAYING, IT JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A WAVE ELECTION, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE'RE WRONG, BUT, CLAIRE McCASKILL IS HERE. [ APPLAUSE ] CLAIRE, I WAS GOING TO SAY -- [ APPLAUSE ]  MY DEAR FRIEND WHO PAYS FOR HIS FRIENDSHIP EVERY DAY ON TWITTER.  OH! EDDIE! [ APPLAUSE ]  EDDIE GLAUDE.  MY MOTHER, GOD BLESS HER SOUL, GOD REST HER SOUL, ALWAYS SAID, JOEY, JUDGE YOURSELF BY YOUR ENEMIES. POOR EDDIE IS JUDGED BY HIS FRIENDS WITH ME SO I APPRECIATE YOUR FRIENDSHIP. CLAIRE, LISTEN. I DON'T BELIEVE IN KNOCKING POLLSTERS BECAUSE IT'S AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK TRYING TO GUESS WHO'S GOING TO COME OUT. AND OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF CYCLES THEY'VE UNDERESTIMATED RIGHT-WING POPULISTS. SO WE'VE SEEN POLLS WAY OFF. LAST NIGHT WHEN I STARTED SEEING EXIT POLLS THAT SAID MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE, AND ABORTION WAS AT THE TOP AND ONE MEDIA EXIT POLL AFTER YORE E EXIT POLL, WAIT A SECOND. BEFORE THE ELECTION DOWN TO 5%. SHOCKED US OFF. DOWN TO 5%. SO AFTER THE RESULTS STARTED COMING IN I SAID, OH, MY GOD. THESE ARE THE VOTERS THAT THE POLLSTERS MISSED. THAT THERE WAS A HUGE SURGE OF PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT WHO SAID, NO, NO, NO. YOU KNOW WHAT? TAKE AWAY SOMEBODY ELSE'S RIGHTS. YOU'RE NOT TAKING AWAY MINE. I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO PUT DOBBS AND ABORTION AT THE TOP OF THE LIST FOR -- EXPLAINING A LOT THAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.  YEAH. LAST NIGHT WAS A VERY BAD NIGHT FOR DONALD TRUMP, BUT IT WAS A VERY GOOD NIGHT FOR WOMEN. [ APPLAUSE ] AND -- YOU KNOW, THAT OLD SAYING, \"HELL HATH NO FURY\"?  YEAH.  I DON'T THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND STOOD HOW IT WAS VISCERAL. IT WAS, YOU KNOW, WOMEN FELT IT IN THEIR GUT.  AND I THINK MEN, TOO, FOR THE WOMEN THEY LOVE AND CARE ABOUT.  EXACTLY. BUT WE HAVE GRABBED BACK FREEDOM.  UH-HUH.  FOR THE DEMOCRATS, WITH THIS ISSUE. [ APPLAUSE ]  AND, BY THE WAY, THIS IS NOT A BLUE STATE ISSUE AS WE SAW IT IN KANSAS.  AND KENTUCKY.  I WAS GOING TO SAY. AND AS WE SAW IN KENTUCKY LAST NIGHT. THIS IS NOT A BLUE STATE ISSUE. AN ISSUE, AGAIN, FOR 65% OF AMERICANS, REALLY MATTERS. REPUBLICANS, THEY DIDN'T JUST CELEBRATE THE OVERTURNING OF ROE. STATE LEGISLATORS STARTED PASSING JUST THE MOST EXTREME PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT WE SAW IN EXIT POLLS LAST NIGHT. ONLY 9% OF AMERICANS SUPPORTED.  KENTUCKY.  THEY'RE NOT GOING TO STOP, JOE. A REAL PROBLEM FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP PUSHING THIS. THERE IS A SEGMENT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THAT THIS IS THE ONLY MOTIVATING FORCE IN THEIR LIFE AS IT COMES TO THE GOVERNMENT, AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO STOP.  YEAH.  THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP GOING. THEY'RE GOING TO GO AFTER MEDICAL ABORTIONS, BECAUSE NOW THE PILL IS BEING USED WAY MORE FREQUENTLY THAN ANY OTHER METHOD. THEY'RE EVENTUALLY GOING TO GO AFTER IVF. I BELIEVE ACTUALLY IMPACT IVF IN THIS COUNTRY'S IN SOME STATES.  YEAH.  IF THERE IS NOT A FEDERAL LAW PASSED THAT CODIFIES ROE.  SO OUR HEADLINE RIGHT NOW, EDDIE, SAYS \"DOBBS DENIERS LIFT DEMOCRATS.\" TALK ABOUT THE SECOND, DENIERS. CRUSHED LAST NICE IN GOVERNORS' RACES. CRUSHED. YOU STILL HAVE ARIZONA THAT'S STILL STANDING OUT THERE AND MAYBE SHE SQUEAK AS OUT A WIN, IF SHE DOES, LIKE ONE OUT OF SEVEN, ONE OUT OF EIGHT. ELECTION DENIERS PROVED LAST NIGHT, THAT THAT IS A RECIPE FOR DEFEAT.  ABSOLUTELY. ANOTHER IT \"D\" WORD. DOBBS, DENIERS, DONALD, BUT WHO WON? WHAT WON? DEMOCRACY.  HMM.  WE SAW THE POWER OF -- DEMOCRACY ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF EVERYDAY PEOPLE, JOE. IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS, DEPENDS ON EVERYDAY ORDINARY PEOPLE TO STEP UP, TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBLE OF THE REPUBLIC. WE SAW LAST NIGHT AND SHOULDN'T GET AHEAD OF OUR SKIS, MIKA'S FAVORITE PHRASE. SHOULDN'T GET AHEAD OF OUR SKIS AND THINK EVERYTHING IS RESOLVED. IT WASN'T. THERE WASN'T A RED WAVE OR A RED TSUNAMI, ELECTION DENIERS WANT TO ERODE FUNDAMENTAL FOUNDATIONS OF OUR DEMOCRACY FAILED, FAILED MISERABLY.  WE HAVE TALKED. GRIM CONVERSATIONS AROUND THIS SET. WHAT'S THAT SAY TO YOU, ABOUT THE FACT THAT FROM COAST TO COAST, AMERICANS ROSE UP AND SAID, YOU KNOW WHAT? NO. WE KIND OF LIKE OUR DEMOCRACY THE WAY IT IS. AND ALSO, EXIT POLLS LAST NIGHT SHOWED, LIKE, 80% OF AMERICANS WERE LIKE, YEAH. I ACTUALLY THINK THAT ELECTIONS ARE FAIR IN AMERICA.  ALL RIGHT. WELL, IT LET'S ME KNOW THAT THERE ARE AMERICANS WHO FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT OUR WAY OF LIFE IS A GOOD THING.  RIGHT.  BUT IT DOESN'T RESOLVE THE PROBLEMS WE FACE.  RIGHT.  WE COME OUT OF LAST NIGHT STILL DEEPLY DIVIDED. BUT IT SEEMS CLEAR TO ME AMERICA'S DECIDED NO THE TO GIVE THE REINS TO MAD MEN AND WOMEN.  HOST OF \"WAY TOO EARLY,\" JONATHAN LEMIRE WITH US. [ APPLAUSE ]  YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET ON A PLANE BE TO SOUTHEAST ASIA WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT, THOUGH. BY THEIR OWN ADMISSION, NO RED WAVE. HEARD THAT FROM REPUBLICANS IN PUBLIC LAST NIGHTWHO EXPECTED BIG NUMBERS. TALK ABOUT WAVES OF 2010 OR YEARS LIKE THAT, TALKING 40, 50, 60 SEATS. THIS IS GOING TO BE A HANDFUL OF SEATS AND A NET GAIN. REPUBLICANS LIKELY CONTROL HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, BUT A SMALL MARGIN. WHAT DO REPUBLICANS TAKE AWAY FROM THIS AND WHAT DO DEMOCRATS SEE FROM THE RESULTS LAST NIGHT JRCHLT CERTAINLY A SIGNIFICANT DISATHE APPOINTMENT FOR REPUBLICANS. MOOD AT MAR-A-LAGO WHERE DONALD TRUMP HELD AND ELECTION NIGHT PARTY VERY, VERY SUBDUED. A LOT OF HIS HAND-PICKED CANDIDATES GONE DOWN TO DEFEAT AND ALSO, OF COURSE, TALKING ABOUT THIS MORNING, RON DeSANTIS EMBOLDENED. SEEMS MIGHT BE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. NOT SITTING WELL WITH THE OTHER FLORIDA MAN IN THIS EQUATION. THEY'RE DISAPPOINTED. YES, STILL MAY KEEP THE HOUSE BUT SLIM MARGIN. IT STALL THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. NOWHERE NEAR WHAT THEY TAUGHT. DEMOCRATS EMBOLDENED. NEFF IS STILL OUT. REPORTS COMING IN, VOTES STILL COUNTED. REAL CLOSE. IF DEMS HANG ON KEEP ARIZONA LOOKING GOOD, THEN THEY'LL HAVE CONTROL OF THE SENATE EVEN WITHOUT POTENTIAL --  AND SUPREME COURT SELECTIONS, ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL.  ABSOLUTELY. KEEP THE SENATE, YOU CAN CONFIRM YOUR JUDGES. YOU CAN GET YOUR CABINET MEMBERS CONFIRMED AND, YES. SCOTUS NOMINATION OPENS UP, VACANCY, DO THAT, TOO. ESPECIALLY KEEP THE SENATE, A BIG WINNER, STEPS ON TO THE FLIGHT TO AIR FORCE ONE A COUPLE OF SUMMITS WITH A PEP IN HIS STEP AND TALK THAT HE MIGHT NOT DO THE TRADITIONAL DAY AFTER MIDTERM NEWS CONFERENCE. WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME -- I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED.  ADVISER CLOSE TO BIDEN TELLS NBC NEWS THE PRESIDENT AND ALLIES BELIEVE RESULTS ARE CLEARLY BETTER THAN THEY COULD HAVE BEEN AND TWEETED A PHOTO CONGRATULATING DEMOCRATIC WINNERS. JOE, ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE WEEKS LEADING UP TO THIS ELECTION, AND CLAIRE MIGHT AGREE, CONCERNED ABOUT THE PERFORMANCE OF SOME DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES.  RIGHT.  AND WE STILL ARE, BUT IT DOES SHOW THAT VOTERS, THEY DECIDED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS AS WELL, IN A BIG WAY WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRACY. WHEN IT COMES TO, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M GOING TO BELIEVE IN THIS ELECTION.  YEAH.  AND I'M GOING TO BELIEVE IN OUR ELECTION PROCESS AND I'M GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DEMOCRACY, BECAUSE THIS IS OUR COUNTRY.  LOOK AT PENNSYLVANIA, CLAIRE. WE ALL SAW THE FETTERMAN/OZ DEBATE AND FETTERMAN, I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, CLEARLY CHALLENGED. THERE WAS A -- THE GUY OBVIOUSLY, HIS COMMUNICATION WAS IMPAIRED, AND --  HE SHOWED UP.  AND HE SHOWED UP AND I THINK GOT A LOT OF POINTS FOR THAT.  YEAH.  IN A SITUATION, I'M SURE, WAS NERVOUS, PROBABLY MADE HIS CONDITION WORSE, AND THAT'S REALLY THE LAST WE SAW, BUT YOU SEE CLIPS ON LOCAL PITTSBURGH STATIONS AND PHILLY STATIONS OF HIM RALLYING THE LAST WEEK. BIG, BOOMING VOICE. CONFIDENCE. JOKING. THAT'S WHAT VOTERS IN PENNSYLVANIA SAW. A VERY STRONG, VERY CONNECTED JOHN FETTERMAN. KIND OF MADE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE END.  IT DID. YOU KNOW, JOHN FETTERMAN WAS THE ESSENCE OF AUTHENTICITY.  YEAH.  COMFORTABLE IN HIS OWN SKIN. COMFORTABLE, HEY, I WEAR A HOODIE AND SHORTS. I'M GOING TO WEAR A HOODIE AND SHORTS. DEAL WITH IT.  WAIT. PLEASE. DON'T TELL MY KIDS THAT.  I'M TELLING YOU.  JUST KIDDING.  AND THE MEANWHILE, GOT MR. CRUDE TAY, SATURDAY BEFORE THE ELECTION DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THE STEELERS HAD A BYE WEEK. THAT IS POLITICAL MALPRACTICE IN PENNSYLVANIA AND SHOWS HE IS NOT A PENNSYLVANIAN.  NO. THAT IS, WE TALKED ABOUT IT. THAT'S LIKE MARTHA COAKLEY, LIKE MRS. PRONOUNCING A FEW RED SOX NAMES AND SAYING, BEEN TO FENWAY ONCE. I'M NOT SURE. IS THAT AN OPEN MARKET? BY THE WAY, MASSACHUSETTS. FIRST WOMAN GOVERNOR LAST NIGHT.  YES. [ APPLAUSE ]  PICK UP FOR DEMS THERE. YOU'RE RIGHT. WE JOKED ABOUT THE FENWAY PARK THING AND STEELERS BYE WEEK BUT IT REINFORCED PERCEPTION HE WAS NOT OF PENNSYLVANIA.  RIGHT.  THAT HE WAS FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT PENNSYLVANIANS CARE ABOUT. WE KNOW IN THE KEYSTONE STATE, STEELERS/EAGLES, FIRST AND SECOND. EVERY OTHER MATTER AFTER THAT. SHOWED OZ WASN'T ONE OF THEM AND FETTERMAN PROVED THE DOWN STRETCH HE WAS.  DEFINITELY.  ONE LAST POINT. TALKING ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT ESPECIALLY WITH RON DeSANTIS. FEELING YET, OF RON DeSANTIS IF HE DID RUN I WILL TELL YOU THINGS ABOUT HIM THAT WILL NOT BE VERY FLATTERING. I KNOW MORE ABOUT HIM THAN ANYBODY OTHER THAN PERHAPS HIS WIFE, WHO'S REALLY RUNNING HIS CAMPAIGN. DONALD TRUMP IS VERY WORRIED ABOUT RON DeSANTIS.  SCARED OF RON DeSANTIS.  REALLY NEEDS SOME --  A CORONATION LAST NIGHT. YOU CAN'T OVERSTATE HOW MASSIVE DeSANTIS' VICTORY WAS AND ALSO CAN'T OVERSTATE THE CONTRAST BETWEEN RON DeSANTIS' NIGHT LAST NIGHT AND DONALD TRUMP'S. YET A GUY WHO -- LIKE HAD A HISTORIC VICTORY AND WITH DONALD TRUMP. NOT SAYING THIS BEING GLIB. YOU'RE THE GUY THAT LOST YET AGAIN. THIS GUY JUST KEEPS LOSING.  AND FLAILING ON SOCIAL MEDIA. CRITICIZING CANDIDATES HE PREVIOUSLY BACKED BECAUSE THEY LOST. TRYING TO ABSOLVE HIMSELF OF ANY RESPONSIBILITY.  EDDIE GLAUDE JR., CLAIRE McCASKILL, JONATHAN LEMIRE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. > STILL AHEAD ON THIS VERY SPECIAL BROADCAST OF \"MORNING JOE\" WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN BOB WOODWARD, EUGENE ROBINSON AND JON MEACHAM PLUS A LIVE REPORT FROM FLORIDA WHERE REPUBLICANS CAPTURED EVERY STATE-WIDE OFFICE YESTERDAY, AND ALSO GO LIVE TO ARIZONA WHERE THE RACE FOR U.S. SENATE IS STILL TOO EARLY TO CALL, AND THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE TRAILING IN A TIGHT RACE FOR GOVERNOR IS MAKING CLAIM OF FRAUD. WHO'S SURPRISED?  WOW.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. 20221109115925.994|20221109115951.987",

THAT CHANGES THINGS. SO THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT, A FEW STATES LOOKING AT TO SEE HOW IT GOES. HERE'S AN INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT, HOWEVER. IN THE HOUSE, THERE ARE 435 STATES, WE'VE NOW CHANGED OUR PROJECTION HERE AT NBC NEWS TO PROJECT THAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL WIN 220 OF THOSE SEATS AND THE DEMOCRATS WILL WIN 215 OF THEM, HOWEVER, BECAUSE AS A PROJECTION, AND IT'S PHYSICAL, AND BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL A LOT OF VOTES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN COUNTED, WE ARE PLUS OR MINUS TEN SEATS ON THIS THING. TEN STATES! WHICH STILL MEANS THAT AT THIS, OUR ALMOST 4 AM IN THE EAST, WE DON'T KNOW WHO IS GOING TO CONTROL THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

ALL RIGHT I WANT TO PULL OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE AND SHOW YOU, LET'S, GO HOLD ON TO CARLOTTA, THIS IS NOT ONE THAT IT WOULD BE IN CONTENTION THIS IS THE INCUMBENT TO THE -- YOU ALL KNOW ABOUT LAUREN BOEBERT, WE DON'T THINK ABOUT MUCH OF, HER ONLY 87% IS HERE BUT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO MAKE A, CALL BOTH 87% OF THE VOTES TO THEIR DISTRICT DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER IT'S LEADING JUST -- BUT LAUREN BOEBERT IS ACTUALLY BEHIND AND SPENT MOST OF THE EVENING BEHIND. BUT AGAIN WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR AND ONCE WE DO, WE'LL GIVE YOU MORE INFORMATION, HERE'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT. WHEN IT COMES TO 2000 AND 2020 AND THEN PLUS OR MINUS TEN STATES.  WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE IS HOW THE STATES ARE NOT MADE A DECISION ON OR HAVE NOT BEEN MADE A CALL ON IN CALIFORNIA. YOU COULD OBVIOUSLY SEE IN COASTAL CALIFORNIA UP UNTIL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALL OF THESE COASTAL DISTRICTS, RALLIES ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE BLUE. THIS IS TYPICAL OF WHAT YOU WOULD SAY MORE INLAND, CALIFORNIA, AND I WANT TO GET TO THE SOUTH, A LITTLE MORE IN TERMS OF REGISTERING. WE'LL LOOK AT ALL OF THE ONES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN CALLED JUST YET. AND THAT IS WHERE WE ARE STILL WAITING TO GET A LOT OF INFORMATION FROM, WE ARE STILL WAITING ON INFORMATION AND NEVADA, WE ARE OBVIOUSLY STILL WAITING ON INFORMATION IN I WAS GONNA. AND WE ARE STILL WAITING ON A SENATE CALL IN WISCONSIN. NOW WISCONSIN, RON JOHNSON IS A WINNING, IF HE WINS, IT DOESN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO THE CONTROL OF THE SENATE, BECAUSE THAT IS A REPUBLICAN STATE THAT WOULD REMAIN A REPUBLICAN STATE, SO THE ONES THAT THE DEMOCRATS, OR THE REPUBLICANS ARE HOPING TO CAPTURE RIGHT NOW FOR THE SENATE ARE GOING TO BE ACTUALLY -- LET ME JUST TELL YOU, I'M NOT AS GOOD AT THIS AS STEVE IS. LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT HERE: GEORGIA AS ONE OF THE POTENTIAL REPUBLICAN PICK, UP RALLIES THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE LOOKING FOR. ARIZONA AND NEVADA. ALASKA CONTINUES TO BE UNCALLED BUT THE TWO LEADING CONTENDERS THERE FOR THE SENATE ARE BOTH REPUBLICANS SO, ALASKA IS GOING TO SAY REPUBLICANS. SO THERE ARE THREE WAYS THAT REPUBLICANS NEED TO GAINS AND AS A RESULT, OF NEEDING TO GAINS, THEY HAVE TO WIN TWO OF THE THREE OUTSTANDING PLACES.  AN INTERESTING THING ALI, ABOUT THE ABIGAIL SPANBERGER RACE, THE VIRGINIA SEVEN, WAS EARLY ON, THIS WAS THE SAME AS WEATHER WAS GONNA BE A BELLWETHER FOR THE DEMOCRATS COURSE OF THE EVENING. IT'S PLAYED A QUITE INTERESTING AWAY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT WAS IN A DISTRICT THAT WAS A DISTRICT THAT WAS REDRAWN TO DILUTE HER INITIAL -- IMPACT THERE WAS SOME CONTROVERSY AROUND THE DISTRICT WAS DRAWN TO EXCLUDE HER HOUSE FROM IT. AND AT THE SAME TIME, YES LEE VEGA WAS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE FAR-RIGHT MOVEMENT OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. SHE BASICALLY SUPPORTED THE TOTAL ABORTION BAN SHE WAS SEEN AS SOMEWHAT OF AN EXTREMIST, IF YOU, WELL WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN RANKS, SO THE FACT THAT ABACO SPANBERGER WAS ABLE TO PULL THIS OUT PRETTY EARLY, I THINK WAS A SIGN THAT THE DEMOCRATS WERE GOING TO HAVE A RELATIVELY BETTER THAN EXPECTED EVENING.  AND ABIGAIL SPANBERGER FITS INTO AN INTERESTING NARRATIVE FOR REPUBLICANS. RIGHT? FOREIGN NATIONAL SECURITY PERSON, CIA, SO SHE DOESN'T SORT OF FALL INTO THE WHOLE SOFT ON CRIME, LONG ORDER.  YEAH, I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS PROJECTION -- THIS IS WHERE THE NORMALLY COMES OUT. TO SEE TO --  JUSTICE?  OKAY FINE -- [LAUGHS] THAT WAS AN EXCELLENT BURN! SO THIS IDEA THAT REPUBLICANS COULD HAVE 220 SEATS, THEY NEED TO 18 FOR THE SEATS AND MAJORITY. FOLKS NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS BECAUSE -- HOW -- HOW -- LET'S PRETEND KEVIN MCCARTHY BECOMES THE NEXT SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE. I DON'T THINK HE WILL, THIS IS JUST ME, I DON'T THINK HE WILL, BUT -- MEANING IF EVEN REPUBLICANS TAKE MAJORITY, I'M NOT SO SURE THAT THEY -- WELL  THERE ARE TWO QUESTIONS, DO THEY WIN THE MAJORITY? AND THAT IF THEY DO, WILL HE BE THE SPEAKER?  EXACTLY WILL BE THE SPEAKER -- NOW THE QUESTION IS HOW TO THE REPUBLICAN SPEAKER GOVERNS? BECAUSE HE OR SHE ONLY HAS A TWO SEAT MAJORITY, THAT MEANS THE SPEAKER, THE REPUBLICAN SPEAKER WILL NEED DEMOCRATIC VOTES TO PASS BIG THINGS, SUCH AS RAISING THE DEBT CEILING. DEFENSE SPENDING. A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS! SUDDENLY, EVEN IF DEMOCRATS ARE NOT IN THE MAJORITY, THEY WILL STILL BE ABLE TO WHEEL INTERESTING POWER IN THE MINORITY BECAUSE THE MARGIN IS STILL TEN. AND THEN ON TOP OF IT, THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO THEN FOCUS ON WHETHER THEY ARE IN THE MAJORITY OR THE MINORITY. WHO'S OUR LEADERSHIP?  AND YOU KNOW THE SCARY THING IS? YOU KNOW WHO'S GONNA HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEM IF YOU HAVE A KEVIN MCCARTHY ONE OTHER SPEAKER WITH A TWO SEAT MAJORITY OR REPUBLICAN CAUCUS THAT IS A RAZOR-THIN? THE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE'S OF THE WORLD -- AND THEM AT GATES OF THE WORLD, CAN YOU IMAGINE THOSE GUYS HAVING MORE POWER THAN -- I MAJORITY HAVE THE MEGAPHONES, IMAGINE HAVING ACTUAL LEGISLATIVE POWER. WHAT YOU CAN DO TO COMPLETELY STYMIE THE REPUBLICAN --  I THINK JONATHAN'S POINTS, THAT PUTS A LOT OF REPUBLICANS, MAYBE OF WHOM WE STILL INTERVIEW AND WHO DON'T HOLD EXTREME VIEWS INTO A TOUGH POSITION. BECAUSE IN THIS PARTY ACTUALLY LOOKED FURTHER TO THE RIGHT, THIS IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR A LOT OF MAINSTREAM REPUBLICANS WHO WOULD LIKE TO GET ELECTED IN 2024, AT THE SCENE THAT THIS WAS THEIR BEST CHANCE TO HAVE A RED WAVE, AT THE MOMENT, WE DO HAVE INFLATION, WE DO HAVE YOU NO LEGITIMATE CONCERNS ABOUT THINGS OUT THERE. IF IT DIDN'T HAPPEN TONIGHT, THEN THEY MAY HAVE TO GOVERN DIFFERENTLY.  EXCEPT THAT LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THESE CANDIDATES. RIGHT? THESE TWO KIND OF TRUMP ENDORSED HANDPICKED, BUDGET, J.D. BAD, THEY ARE NOT FLIPPING DISTRICTS. THEY ARE HOLDING ON TO REPUBLICAN SEATS. RIGHT? SO TRUMP AND HIS FRIENDS HAVE NOT YET PROVE THEIR THEORY OF THE CASE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT YET SHOWN THAT THEY CAN EXPAND THE MAP. SO IT'S PART OF WHY WE ARE WATCHING WHAT HAPPENED WITH KARI LAKE, IT'S PART OF WHAT WE ARE WATCHING WHAT HAPPENS WITH HERSCHEL WALKER, BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE WE ARE REALLY GOING TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT HE HAS THE LEVEL OF CONTROL OVER THIS PARTY --  REMEMBER, TEN SEATS WOULD'VE SLIPS EITHER WAY JUST BECAUSE OF REDISTRICTING. RIGHT? SO ANYTHING FEWER THAN TEN SEAT AS AGAIN FOR REPUBLICANS ISN'T ACTUALLY AGAIN. TAKE A LOOK AT GEORGIA, 96% OF THE VOTE, AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK WITH 49.1% OF THE VOTES. WHICH IS NOT ENOUGH TO WIN IN GEORGIA BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET 50% OF THE VOTE. IT'S STILL TOO CLOSE TO CALL. AT SOME POINT, IF SOMEBODY DOESN'T GET 50%, THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE IS GOING TO HAVE TO CALL THAT AS A RUNOFF AND THAT WILL HAPPEN IN A MONTH. WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WILL HAPPEN, BUT BRAD RAFFENSPERGER IS THE SECRETARY OF STATE. HE WAS REELECTED TONIGHT. STAY WITH US, WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK! 20221109084530.393|20221109084635.592",

        "trs": "I MET LISA AND, AS YOU ARE WATCHING MSNBC CONTINUING ELECTION COVERAGE, JOINING US NOW, JULI\u00c1N CASTRO, FOR SECRETARY OF HOUSE AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. IT IS AN MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST, JULI\u00c1N, ALWAYS GREAT TO SEE YOU! WE WOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION AT THE TABLE ABOUT WHAT A BALANCE OF WHAT IT'S GOING TO MAINE FOR A LEGISLATIVE AGENDA. WHAT DO YOU THINK?  WELL NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS NOW, IT'S GONNA BE A SUPER CLOSE AND IF THE DECISION DESK PROJECTION IS RIGHT, LET'S SAY IT'S THESE THAT'S ARE GONNA HAPPEN, EVEN IF REPUBLICANS TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE, IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO GET THE MOST EXTREME PARTS OF THEIR AGENDA ACCOMPLISHED. HOWEVER, IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT EVEN IF THEY WIN THE HOUSE BY ONE VOTE, THEY ARE GOING TO CONTROL THE COMMITTEES, THEY ARE GOING TO LAUNCH INVESTIGATIONS, THEY'RE GOING TO CREATE BIG HEADACHES, UNFOUNDED INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, AND UNDO A LOT OF THE GOOD WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATING JANUARY SIX AND SO FORTH. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS GOING TO BE TREMENDOUSLY CONSEQUENTIAL, NOT TO MENTION OF COURSE IN THE SENATE, THEY WILL PUT A HALT TO JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS. SO, THERE'S A LOT THAT HANGS IN THE BALANCE THAT WILL CHANGE JUST BY ONE VOTE THAT CONTROLS THE SENATE AND THE HOUSE.  WHEN YOU TALK THOUGH ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE ALL BEEN REFERENCING AS INVESTIGATION -PALOOZA, EVEN THAT THEY ARE NOT COMING AT IT TONIGHT WITH ANY KIND OF MANDATE, DO YOU THINK THAT THEY STILL STICK THE COURSE?  I THINK, SO ALICIA, UNFORTUNATELY LOOK AT HOW OFF THE ROWS THEY HAVE GONE ON ANY NUMBER OF ISSUES INCLUDING SUCH A PERSONAL ISSUE LIKE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE. THAT PUTS THEM OUT OF LINE WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS AND STILL THEY PLOW FORWARD. I MEAN THERE EXTREMISM IS PART OF THE REASON THAT THE ELECTION DENIED IS EVEN CLOSE. MUCH CLOSER THAN ABOUT ANYBODY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FOR CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. BUT STILL, THEY GO ON! I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE AND TRY TO DO THAT IF THEY TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE.  SECRETARY JULIAN CASTRO, THIS IS -- SAN ANTONIO'S SO YOU ARE FROM TEXAS, YOU KNOW TEXAS, I AM CURIOUS TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT HAPPENED TO BETO O'ROURKE AND HIS CAMPAIGN FOR GOVERNOR.  YOU KNOW, THIS IS A TOUGH ONE, JONATHAN, BECAUSE BETHEL HAS LAID THE FOUNDATION, I, THANK FOR DEMOCRATS TO SUCCEED, ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS, FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN HE VISITED ALL 254 COUNTIES, THIS TIME WHEN HE WAS VERY ACTIVE. I AM IN UNFATHOMABLE CANDIDATE THAT HAD A LOT OF ENERGY, AND AT THE SAME TIME, FOLKS BELIEVE THAT HE WAS GOING TO GET A LOT CLOSER THAN IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S GOING TO GET DENIED THE LATEST NUMBER THAT I SAW SUGGESTED THAT HE COULD LOSE BY DOUBLE DIGITS. PEOPLE DO NOT EXPECT THAT. THAT IS DISPIRITING, MY HOPE IS THAT YOU KNOW, ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, WE CAN TAKE SOMETHING FROM THE FACT THAT THAT NARRATIVE THAT HAD BEEN DEVELOPED ABOUT THE REAL -- THE HEAVILY HISPANIC AREA, GOING REPUBLICAN DID NOT COME TO PASS, TO THOSE THE CONGRESSIONAL RACES HAVE GONE DEMOCRATIC AND THE OTHER ONE TEXAS 15 WAS ACTUALLY WE DISTRACTED A COUPLE YEARS AGO TO FAVOR A REPUBLICAN. SO THAT IS NOT A BIG SURPRISE.  SECRETARY CASTRO YOU OF COURSE RAN FOR PRESIDENT YOURSELF, YOU ARE ACCUSTOMED TO LOOKING AT MAPS, FIGURING OUT A PATH TO VICTORY. AS YOU LOOK AT THE MAP THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT TONIGHT, RIGHT? WHERE THE BIG OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ARE ALL COMING OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST, WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY?  THAT THE PARTY NEEDS TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PLACES LIKE NEVADA, ARIZONA AND I AGREE WITH FOLKS AS WELL THAT SAY WE SHOULD'VE INVESTED MORE IN NORTH CAROLINA, THERE WAS SHERYL BEASLEY RIGHT THERE ON THE DOORSTEP OF TAKING A SENATE SEAT. WE LEFT FLORIDA, FOR LOOKS LIKE IT'S NOT THE SWING STATE THAT USED TO BE. LOST OHIO, DECISIVELY, AGAIN EVEN THOUGH A LOT OF FOLKS BELIEVE THAT THE PROFILE THAT THE TIMELINE CUTS THAT HE WAS GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL THERE. BUT WE NEED TO START INVESTING IN THE SOUTHWEST AND THE WEST AND THESE EMERGING STATES LIKE NORTH CAROLINA. I THINK IF WE DO, THAT THAT WON'T ONLY HELP IN THE MIDTERMS, BUT WHY THE HEALTH AND THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEARS SO THAT IS WORK TO BE DONE FOR 2024.  IT'S NOT A LAW FOR A COMPLETE REIMAGINING OF THE PRESIDENTIAL, JULIAN CASTRO, THEY GET SO MUCH AS ALWAYS! WE HAVE MORE TO COME, NEXT! HAVE MORE TO COME, NEXT \u266a \u266a \u266a  ARE STILL, ACCOUNT OF A COFFEE, WE ARE JOINED IN THE NEXT HOUR FOR MULTI PARTY CONGRESS MINUTE JOE LOST. PLUS CHRISTINA CAREER AND FERNANDO MONDAY, ANOTHER HOUR OF MIDTERM COVERAGE STARTS RIGHT NOW! \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a \u266a  ALL RIGHT THANK FOR STAYING UP WITH US, I'M ALI VELSHI, IS NOW FOUR -- I MEAN THANKS FOR WAKING UP. R WAKING UP. IT'S 4:00 ON THE EAST COAST, MY FRIENDS ARE NOT ABANDON BUT TAKE ALICIA MENENDEZ, AND EMMETT WALKER THE ARE WITH ME. THAT'LL CONTROL REMAINS VERY MUN THE AIR WHICH IS NOT SOMETHING A LOT OF PEOPLE THOUGHT WE'D BE SAYING 4:00 A.M. IN THE EAST. ONE THING IS FOR SURE, PREDICTIONS OF A SO-CALLED RED WAVE HAVE NOT COME TO FRUITION. HERE IS HOW THINGS STAND AT THIS HOUR IN THE FIGHT FOR SENATE CONTROL. DEMOCRATS ARE HOLDING ON TO 48 SEATS, THE GOP AT 47 SEATS. THERE ARE FIVE RACES YET TO CALL. ONE SEAT HAS FLIPPED FROM GOP TO DEMOCRAT, THAT IS IN PENNSYLVANIA WITH THE VICTORY OF JOHN FETTERMAN. FETTERMAN, BY THE WAY, DEFEATED TV CELEBRITY DOCTOR MEHMET OZ. HERE IS JOHN FETTERMAN AND OZ THANKING THEIR SUPPORTERS TONIGHT.  WE LAUNCHED THIS CAMPAIGN ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO. AND WE HAD OUR SLOGAN. IT'S ON EVERY ONE OF THOSE SITES RIGHT NOW. EVERY COUNTY, EVERY VOTE. EVERY COUNTY, EVERY VOTE! AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED. WE JAMMED THEM UP.  I HAVE TOLD YOU MANY, MANY TIMES, THAT I BELIEVE IN YOU. TRAVELED ALL OVER THE COMMONWEALTH TO MAKE THAT MESSAGE CLEAR. TONIGHT, YOU HAVE TOLD ME THAT YOU BELIEVE IN ME. BLESS YOU FOR THAT. TOGETHER, WE WILL HEAL PENNSYLVANIA, AND WE WILL HEAL AMERICA. GOD BLESS YOU.  IN ARIZONA, THE RACE BETWEEN MARK KELLY AND REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER BLAKE MASTERS REMAINS TOO EARLY TO CALL AT THIS HOUR. I THINK THE SENATE RACE, THAT'S WHERE THEY ARE, IT IS 64% OF THE VOTE IS IN. WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD A JUMP THERE IN THE LAST HOUR OR SO. WE'RE AT 55%. UP TO 64%, BUT THE MARGIN STILL REMAINS QUITE WIDE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. WE'LL CONTINUE TO GET INFORMATION FROM ARIZONA ALL NIGHT. THE SENATE RACE BETWEEN THE DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT RAPHAEL WARNOCK AND HERSCHEL WALKER TOO CLOSE TO CALL AT THIS HOUR. EVEN THOUGH 90% OF THE VOTE IS IN. THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GET 50% OF THE VOTE IN ORDER TO WIN. THERE WILL BE A RUNOFF. WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOUSE, THE NBC NEWS DECISION DESK SYSTEMS AT THIS HOUR THAT REPUBLICANS WILL WIN 220 SEATS WITH A MARGIN OF ERROR OF PLUS OR MINUS OF 10 SEATS WHICH IS A BIG MARGIN OF ERROR. SO THIS COULD GO EITHER WAY BECAUSE YOU NEED 218 SEATS TO TAKE THE HOUSE. THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF UNCLOSED RACES AND PROBABLY FOR A FEW DAYS. EXIT POLLS FINDS THAT ABORTION IS THE ISSUE. AND CRIME, MY COLLEAGUES, JONATHAN CAPEHART, ALICEA MENENDEZ AND AYMAN MOHYELDIN ARE WITH ME. WE'VE ALMOST LEFT --  I KNOW, I KNOW.  I'VE GOT SOME DEEP INSECURITIES. I KEEP COMING BACK ASSUMING YOU'RE ALL HERE. I'M SO PLEASED. YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'VE BEEN SPENDING SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER, JONATHAN AND I WE SIT NEXT TO EACH OTHER UPSTAIRS, WHAT SURPRISES YOU NOW. WE'VE GOTTEN THROUGH AN EVENING WHERE WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF SURPRISING THINGS. WHERE ARE YOU NOW HOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT TONIGHT?  WELL, I'M SO FOCUSED BACK TO MY NERDINESS BY THE LAST HOUR. NOW, I'M FASCINATED BY THE PROJECTION OF THE HOUSE.  THE 217 VERSUS 220.  215 VERSUS 220, PLUS OR MINUS 10.  ANYBODY CAN CONTROL CONGRESS. LET'S SAY THE PROJECTION IS RIGHT. 220 WHERE THEY HAVE THE MAJORITY, THE PRINCIPAL THINGS FOR US TO LOOK AT, IN TERMS OF WHO'S THE NEXT SPEAKER REALLY GOING TO BE. WHAT'S THEIR GOVERNING AGENDA. WHAT CAN THEY GET THROUGH? WHAT COMPROMISES DOES THAT NEW SPEAKER HAVE TO MAKE WITH THE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS IN ORDER TO GET THE GAVEL, AND WHAT DOES THAT SET UP? THEN ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, NO MATTER WHO, WHETHER THEY'RE IN THE MAJORITY OR THE MINORITY, WHO'S THE NEW LEADERSHIP TEAM. WHO'S THE MAJORITY LEADER. WHOSE THE W.H.I.P.? WILL THIS BE THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE MOMENT WHEN DEMOCRATS ELEVATE THAT NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS WITHIN THAT CAUCUS. SO, COME ON, CALIFORNIA. COUNT THOSE VOTES BECAUSE I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO I CAN KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS UNTIL THE NEW CONGRESS IS SEATED.  TO LAYER ON TO JONATHAN'S EXCELLENT ANALYSIS, BECAUSE I HAVE ALL OF THE SAME QUESTIONS AS WE MOVE TO THIS QUESTION OF GOVERNANCE. REPUBLICANS RAN ON A CORE ISSUE THAT THEY HAVE NO REAL PLAN TO ADDRESS AND THAT'S INFLATION. ONCE THEY ARE TO BE IN CHARGE, IF THEY ARE TO BE IN POWER AND IT BECOMES THEIR ANSWER TO THE QUESTION TO THE FACT THAT THEY ARE DEALING WITH A GLOBAL ISSUE?  YEAH. FOR ME, I'M LOOKING AT THE TRUMP EFFECT. AND WHETHER WE'RE DONE WITH THAT, WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. WHEN YOU LOOK THE HIS JOURNEY FROM 2016 TO 2020 AND WHERE HE IS NOW. THERE ARE STILL TWO KEY RACES THAT ARE UNDECIDED THAT I THINK STILL HAVE TRUMP'S NAME ON THEM, KARI LAKE, HERSCHEL WALKER. BUT AS YOU SAID, J.D. VANCE, THOUGH HE'S A TRUMP AACOLYTE, THAT'S A HOLD, BUT I WOULD BE LOOKING AT IT AS THE RON DeSANTIS EFFECT AND THE DONALD TRUMP EFFECT. AND SEE WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS GOING TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT ITSELF AND SAY I THINK WE DON'T NEED DONALD TRUMP AS MUCH AS WE THOUGHT WE NEED HIM.  LET'S BE HONEST, WHEN YOU SAY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NEEDS TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT ITSELF, REALLY, IT'S THE BIG REPUBLICAN DONORS WHO ARE GOING TO BE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE THEY'RE PLACING THEIR BET.  EXACTLY. FOX. WHO FOX IS GOING TO GET BEHIND.  WELL, IT'S BEEN KIND OF CLEAR WHO THEY'RE GETTING BEHIND. THEY'RE SORT OF -- YOU KNOW, KICKED DONALD TRUMP TO THE CURB. AND THEY'RE CASTING ABOUT. BUT THEY'RE CASTING ABOUT, BUT REALLY LOOKING TOWARDS FLORIDA AND LOOKING AT DeSANTIS. AND I THINK DeSANTIS' VICTORY AND THE SIZE OF HIS VICTORY.  DECISIVE.  DECISIVE. AND MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR REPUBLICANS TO PUT DONALD TRUMP IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR FOR 2023.  YEAH.  WHILE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FLORIDA, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RACES IN FLORIDA. THE SENATE RACE, 98%, WE CALLED IT FOR MARCO RUBIO. THE INCUMBENT. QUITE A BIG MARGIN. 1.25 MILLION VOTES, 57.7 TO VAL DEMINGS, 41.3%. VAL DEMINGS IF CRIME IS YOUR ISSUE, IS THIS A VERY PROMINENT WOMAN PUTTING FORWARD A STRONG CASE AND YET DECISIVELY DEFEATED. RON DeSANTIS 59.4% OVER 40%. HERE'S AN INTERESTING THING, CHARLIE CRIST, FORMER GOVERNOR OF THE STATE, RON DeSANTIS FULLY CLEANING UP IN FLORIDA. WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY THE NAME MOST CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH IT IF DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T DECLARE ON NOVEMBER 15th THAT HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT WHICH HE HAS STRONG IN HIS WORDS -- VERY, VERY MUCH HINTED HE'S GOING TO DO, RON DeSANTIS IS THE GUY YOU'RE LOOKING TO. . I WANTED TO GIVE YOU CONTEXT.  NO, NO, I APPRECIATE THAT. THE POINT I WAS GOING TO CONTINUE WITH, ALI, RON DeSANTIS DELIVERED FLORIDA IN A FEW WAYS. NOT ONLY DID HE WIN HIS RACE DECISIVELY, MARCO RUBIO ALSO WON HIS RACE DESIZIVELY. GOING BACK TO JONATHAN'S POINT ABOUT MARGINS AND PROJECTIONS RIGHT NOW, IN ORDER TO HAVE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, YOU NEEDED 218 SEATS, REPUBLICANS WERE POISED TO PICK UP A HANDFUL OF THOSE AS THEY DID IN FLORIDA JUST ON THE MERE FACT OF REDISTRICTING. RON DeSANTIS WAS ABLE TO GET THE REDISTRICTING DONE TO DILUTE THAT AND AN EARLY JUMP-START FOR A HANDFUL OF DISTRICTS. I THINK WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE FUTURE OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. LOOK, HE HASN'T BEEN TESTED NATIONALLY. YOU CAN SAY RON DeSANTIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED NATIONALLY. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT TAKING SHOTS AT HIM. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF HE DOES RESPOND. IN TERMS OF DELIVERY, AS YOU SAY, BILLIONAIRE DONORS ARE GOING TO BE LINING UP WATCHING WHERE IT GOES FROM HERE AND WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO PUT THEIR MONEY. RON DeSANTIS HAS A VICTORY ON HIS BELT AND SAY LOOK WHAT I DID IN FLORIDA AND I'M READY TO TAKE IT NATIONWIDE.  WE SAID THANKS FOR STAYING WITH US TO ALL THE FOLKS, BUT SOME PEOPLE HAVE WOKEN UP. IT'S 4:00 IN THE MORNING. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT'S HAPPENED IN THE SENATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE WENT INTO THE NIGHT WITH REPUBLICANS NEEDING A GAIN OF ONE SENATORIAL SEAT BECAUSE IT WAS SPLIT 50/50, AND THE VICE PRESIDENT CAN BREAK THE TIE IN FAVOR OF DEMOCRATS. WE NEEDED CONTROL. THEY NEED TWO, WHY? BECAUSE PENNSYLVANIA FLIPPED. PENNSYLVANIA WAS PAT TOOMEY'S SEAT, LONGTIME REPUBLICAN, CONSERVATIVE FISCAL REPUBLICAN, WASN'T REALLY A TRUMPIAN. HE LOSES -- DR. MEHMET OZ IS RUNNING FOR HIS SEAT. JOHN FETTERMAN ENDS UP WINNING. NOT BY THE MARGIN THAT THE GOVERNOR, THE GOVERNOR ELECT WON BY, BUT HE WON. SO, NOW, THE GOP NEEDS TWO SEATS. THIS IS WISCONSIN. AT THE MOMENT IT IS TOO EARLY TO CALL, THE INCUMBENT RON JOHNSON IS WINNING. IF YOU GAVE THIS TO THE REPUBLICANS, THEY STILL -- THAT'S NOT A GAIN. SO IT HAS TO BE OUT OF THESE FOUR STATES. ALASKA IS THERE ANYWAY, BECAUSE IT'S A REPUBLICAN STATE NOW, THE TWO LEADING CANDIDATES ARE REPUBLICANS. NOW IT COMES DOWN TO ARIZONA AND GEORGIA. GEORGIA MAY NOT GET DECIDED TONIGHT, YOU NEED 50% TO WIN GEORGIA. IF NOT, FOUR WEEKS TO GO TO A RUNOFF, DECEMBER 6. AND WE'RE WAITING FOR INFORMATION OUT OF NEVADA AND ARIZONA. LET'S TAKE A QUICK LOOK HERE AT THE RACE FOR THE SENATE. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO, AT 58.5%. ADAM LAXALT HEAD BY 650 VOTES. HE'S JUST TAKEN THE LEAD. 74% IN, WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION THERE.  ALI, CAN I SAY SOMETHING?  YEAH, BECAUSE YOU WERE JUST THERE, RIGHT?  I WAS JUST THERE. I THINK SOMETIMES SINCE WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT BLAKE MASTERS, THERE HASN'T BEEN AS MUCH ATTENTION, BUT THIS IS SOMEONE WHO ISN'T JUST AN ELECTION DENIER, BUT THIS IS SOMEONE WHO LED THE TRUMP EFFORTS IN 2020. ALSO PREEMPTIVELY IN THE ADVANCE OF ELECTION DAY HAS QUESTIONED THE RESULTS WHAT HAS NOT HAPPENED. WE'RE LOOKING AT TWO DIFFERENT STORY LINES HERE. CONNECTED BUT SEPARATE. WHICH IS, ONE, WHO IS GOING TO WIN THIS RACE? AND TWO, SHOULD THAT VICTOR BE CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO, IS LAXALT GOING TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF A FAIR AND FREE ELECTION?  YEAH, YOU MENTIONED THE INFLATION ISSUE, THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO REPUBLICAN PLAN FOR INFLATION, WHICH A NUMBER OF CONSERVATIVES HAVE BACKED THAT UP. ADAM LAXALT HAS MADE THAT A KEY ISSUE THAT INFLATION IS JOE BIDEN AND THE DEMOCRATS AND DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN FOR IT. HERE WE GO TO ARIZONA, 55% TO 65% IN THE LAST HOUR. FOR THIS HAPPENING ALL NIGHT, FOR THOSE OF YOU THINKING NOTHING IS HAPPENING ALL NIGHT, STAY WITH US, BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GET STUFF OUT OF ARIZONA. THIS REMAINS TOO CLOSE TO CALL. IT'S 66%, BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK CLOSE, MARK KELLY IS AHEAD, 52% TO BLAKE MASTERS. IT'S A REMARKABLE -- I DON'T KNOW, I'M RUNNING OUT OF ADJECTIVES TO USE. HE'S AN ELECTION DENIER. THE SPREAD THERE IS PRETTY GOOD, 118,000 VOTES. BUT IN ARIZONA THERE'S A LOT OF MAIL-IN VOTING. THIS WAS INVENTED BY REPUBLICANS IN ARIZONA, BROUGHT IN BY REPUBLICANS. SO THERE'S JUST A LOT OF ISSUES. WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT MARICOPA COUNTY BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR A LOT OF VOTES. BY THE WAY, TENDS TO VOTE OVERWHELMINGLY DEMOCRATIC, PHOENIX. SLIGHTLY MORE IN VOTING, 58%. YOU SEE THE MARGIN IS NARROWER. 52% TO 45%. LET'S GO TO PIMA COUNTY IN TUCSON, THAT'S ALONG THE BORDER. LOOK AT THAT, 52% OF THE VOTE IN, YOU CAN'T CALL THINGS WHEN YOU HAVE THAT LITTLE VOTE. BUT 65 TO 32. THERE ARE MORE CONSERVATIVE COUNTIES IN THE STATE, YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT, BLAKE MASTERS AHEAD OF MARK KELLY. AND THE COUNTIES WELL AHEAD OF HIM, NAVAJO COUNTY -- THAT'S CLOSER, 50.5 IN GRAHAM COUNTY, YOU CAN WE'VE STILL GOT A LOT OF BUSINESS TO DO IN ARIZONA. AND WE ARE GOING TO SPEND THE NIGHT NOW THINKING ABOUT GEORGIA WHICH MAY NOT GET SETTLED TONIGHT. WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WISCONSIN WHERE THE SITTING SENATOR RON JOHNSON IS IN THE LEAD. AND WE'RE THINKING ABOUT NEVADA AND ARIZONA. THAT'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO COME DOWN. TYPICALLY, ELECTION NIGHT, WE'D BE THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS PLUS PENNSYLVANIA.  UH-HUH.  NUMBERS IN PENNSYLVANIA CAME IN EARLY IN PHILADELPHIA WHICH IS WHERE MOST OF THE VOTES IN PENNSYLVANIA ARE. DECIDED TO WORK THROUGH THE NIGHT. THEY DIDN'T CLOSE UP SHOP AND GO HOME BECAUSE THIS KNEW THAT THE ENTIRE COUNTRY WAITED ON PENNSYLVANIA LAST TIME FOR SEVERAL DAYS. SO WE GOT THE PENNSYLVANIA RESULTS IN VERY QUICKLY. AND MICHIGAN WAS ANOTHER QUESTION, ANOTHER THING WE WERE LOOKING AT. THAT HAS MOSTLIEN DECIDED. AYMAN, YOU SAY THERE'S ONE RACE WE HAVEN'T GOT A CALL ON, DANA NESSEL?  YEAH, DANA NESSEL, THE TRIFECTA BETWEEN DANA NECESSARYING AND GRETCHEN WHITMER.  ALL OF THEM WENT DEMOCRATIC. AND THE ABORTION ISSUE IN THE MICHIGAN ISSUE ONE. SO IT'S UNUSUAL THAT THE DANA NESSEL ONE HAS NOT BEEN SETTLED YET. WE'RE AWAITING THAT TOO. OTHERWISE IN MICHIGAN, IT WAS A CLEAN SWEEP IN PENNSYLVANIA.  IT'S ON THE SCREEN.  WE'LL CONTINUE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THAT.  LET ME ASK YOU QUICKLY, YOU GUYS REMEMBER THIS, ARIZONA IN 2020, ARIZONA HAD THE CRAZY AUDITS AFTERWARDS, THE NINJA BALLOTS.  THE BAMBOO --  RIGHT, THERE WAS A BAMBOO CONNECTION TO ARIZONA. SNIFFING THE PAPER. IT SMELLED LIKE BAMBOO.  WHY IS IT THAT ARIZONA IS NOT ABLE TO HAVE A MORE STREAMLINED VOTING PROCESS? YOU GUYS WERE THERE ON THE GROUND. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT CAME UP ON THE CONVERSATION I GET THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS TO VOTE, THAT'S GREAT, YOU SHOULD HAVE SAME DAY, DROP-IN BALLOTS, DROP BOXES WHY IS THAT AT 1:15 A.M. IN ARIZONA TIME WHY IS THAT SO CRUCIAL?  BECAUSE IT'S BETTER TO DO IT RIGHT THAN DO IT BEST.  RIGHT.  THERE'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION IN THIS COUNTRY. GROWING UP IN CANADA WHERE THERE'S ONE WAY TO VOTE, YOU PUT IT ON A PIECE OF PAPER, YOU FOLD IT UP AND SOMEBODY COUNTS IT. THE THING WITH AMERICA, IF ANYTHING HAS TO DO WITH ELECTIONS IT SHOULD BE HOW QUICKLY WE COUNT BALLOTS AND WHEN YOU START. AND THERE'S NO VOTING FRAUD ISSUE WHATSOEVER IN ARIZONA WHATSOEVER, THEY HAVE MASTERED LIKE WASHINGTON STATE LIKE OTHER PEOPLE, THEY HAVE MASTERED THE ABILITY TO DO ABSENTEE VOTING AND MAIL-IN VOTING. THERE'S NO PROBLEM WHATSOEVER. IT'S NOT THE ACCOUNTING PROBLEM, IT'S THE METHODOLOGY FOR ACCOUNTS. WE DON'T HAVE FEDERAL ELECTION. WE HAVE STATE AND LOCAL ELECTIONS. THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TO HAVE. HOW DO WE GET AND COUNT VOTES AND WHAT GETS COUNTED FIRST IN MAIL-IN AND MILITARY. LIKE PENNSYLVANIA HAS A STUPID, STUPID LAW AND IT ACTUALLY HAS COME IN TODAY, IN PENNSYLVANIA, THE MAIL-IN BALLOT, AND WHAT YOU PUT ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE ENVELOPE ON WHICH YOU PUT YOUR BALLOT, APPARENTLY.  DATE. YOU GOT TO DATE IT PROPERLY.  NOW, THERE IS AN EXPRESSION THAT WE USE FOR THAT IN CANADA FOR THAT RULE. IT STARTS WITH A \"B\" AND SENDS WITH AN \"S.\" WHY IS THE DATE -- WHEN YOU MAIL IN A BALLOT, THEY STAMP IT. WHY IS MY BALLOT INVALIDATED. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LINED UP BECAUSE THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA FIGURED THIS OUT BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE OBJECTING TO IT. THEY CALLED ALL OF THESE PEOPLE AND SAID, PLEASE, PLEASE, GET TO CITY HALL, YOU HAD TO GO TO CITY HALL, A BIT OF A PAIN TO GO TO CITY HALL. THOUSANDS LINED UP SPENT HOURS THERE RECASTING THEIR BALLOTS TODAY. THIS IS THE NONSENSE ABOUT VOTING IN AMERICA. THERE SHOULD BE NO SUCH RULE. IT HAS BEEN FETTERMAN AND HIS TEAM FILED A CASE TO SAY THIS IS AGAINST THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. YOU CAN'T HAVE A STUDENT IMPEDIMENT TO VOTING THAT CAUSES TO YOU PUT A DATE ON THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR ENVELOPE. LAST TIME WAS THE SAME THING, YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR BALLOT INSIDE OF SOMETHING AND THAT GOES INTO SOMETHING.  RIGHT. A SECRECY SLEEVE.  IT'S NONSENSE. YOU LOOK AT A STATE LIKE FLORIDA WHICH IS A LARGE PROBLEM.  WHICH HAD AN ACCOUNTING PROBLEM IN THE PAST.  RIGHT, 2000. YOU LOOK AT HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO GET THE RESULTS EARLY.  FLORIDA HAS FIGURED THIS OUT.  THEN YOU LOOK AT CALIFORNIA, YOU'RE LIKE, GUYS, AGAIN, 1:15 IN THE MORNING, TO JONATHAN'S POINT, WE HAVE NO INDICATION WHAT IS HAPPENING.  WE'D ALL BE GETTING TO BED TWO HOURS AGO. BUT WHAT WOULD YOU BE DOING, RIGHT? JOE WALSH IS STANDING BY TO TALK TO US.  I'M SURE JOE HAS OPINIONS FOR US.  JOE IS SLEEPLESS. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE BALLOTS TO TALK ABOUT, WHAT WOULD WE TALK ABOUT. LET'S STICK AROUND AFTER THE BREAK, JOE IS A TEA PARTY REPUBLICAN. I THINK WE'VE ALL INTERVIEWED HIM.  I'VE GOTTEN INTO FIGHTS WITH HIM.  YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. JOE IS A GUY WE'VE ALL FOUGHT WITH BUT HE'S NEVER LEFT THE GAME BUT HE'S GOT STRONG VIEWS ON WHAT PEOPLE LIKE HIM WHO ARE CONSERVATIVES WHO THINK LIKE HIM HAPPENS.

        "trs": "\u266a\u266a > ALL RIGHT. LAST NIGHT CONTROL OF BOTH CHAMBERS OF CONGRESS WAS UP FOR GRABS. AND IF HISTORY HELD TRUE, THE PARTY THAT CONTROLS THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD TYPICALLY LOSE SEATS. BUT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS POISED TO BECOME ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT AT RETAINING SEATS IN A MIDTERM ELECTION IN MODERN HISTORY. SO WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SO-CALLED RED WAVE? JOINING ME NOW IS FORMER REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN JOE WALSH OF ILLINOIS. HE'S ALSO THE AUTHOR OF THE BOOK \"AT SILENCE.\" JOE, GREAT TO SEE YOU, WE'VE PROBABLY BEEN EXCHANGING MESSAGES ON TWITTER TODAY LIKE HUNDREDS OF OTHERS. IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU. WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENED, YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WHAT DROVE PEOPLE OUT TO THE POLLS TODAY, WHAT REALLY GOT PEOPLE FIRED. YOU THERE'S CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ECONOMIC ANXIETY, ABOUT ABORTION BUT, YOU KNOW, 71% VOTED FOR A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. 28% FOR THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE. THE BREAKDOWN, AND YOU HAVE THAT THERE ON THE SCREEN, OF THE VARIOUS SUBJECTS, I THINK SURPRISED A LOT OF PEOPLE WHAT MOBILIZED OR WHAT MOTIVATED PEOPLE. HOW DO YOU READ THE DEVELOPMENTS OF TODAY, IN TERMS OF THE MOTIVAING FACTOR BEHIND THE TURNOUT?  AYMAN, GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. LOOK, I TAKE A CONTRARIAN VIEW HERE. I THINK ONE OF THE BIG TAKEAWAYS IS THAT AMERICANS REALLY DID CARE ABOUT THE STATE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. EVEN IF THEY HAD A HARD TIME TALKING ABOUT IT, AND EXPLAINING WHAT THAT MEANT, HERE THEY LOOKED AT BALLOTS. IN EVERY STATE IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE REPUBLICANS WERE PUTTING UP CRAZY ELECTION DENIERS. AND I THINK THAT WENT A LONG WAY TOWARD A LOT OF THESE UNDECIDED VOTERS SAYING THIS CAN'T STAND. AT THE END OF THE DAY, I DO CARE ABOUT OUR DEMOCRACY. I GIVE PRESIDENT BIDEN A LOT OF CREDIT FOR MAKING THAT SPEECH JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.  LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE BIDEN APPROVAL FACTOR, BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT THAT AS AN INDICATOR OF WHERE WE WOULD BE BY THE END OF THE NIGHT. THE NUMBERS OF WHERE HIS APPROVAL RATING WAS, WAS AN INDICATOR THAT THE DEMOCRATS WERE GOING TO GET IT ON THE CHIN. THE REPUBLICAN MESSAGING WAS THIS WAS GOING TO BE A RED WAVE, AND IT TURNED OUT NOT TO BE. WHAT DOES TODAY MEAN FOR JOE BIDEN? WE WERE SAYING THIS WILL PROBABLY MEAN HE'S GOING TO BE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENTS. HE CAN CERTAINLY SEE A SILVER LINING IN A NIGHT LIKE THIS. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR HIS GOVERNING STRATEGY GOING FORWARD, EVEN IF THE REPUBLICANS DO TAKE THE HOUSE WITH THE MAJORITY THAT WE'RE, AT THIS POINT, PROJECTING THAT MAYBE 220 TO 215, PLUS OR MINUS 10.  LOOK, I'M NOT A DEMOCRAT, I THINK WHAT THAT MEANS FOR ALL THE REST OF US, WE HAVE TO QUIT UNDERESTIMATING JOE BIDEN. HE'S DID IT AGAIN. HE'S GOTTEN A HELL OF A LOT ACCOMPLISHED IN TWO YEARS. AYMAN, YOU SAID IT, WHEN IT COMES TO A PRESIDENT MIDTERM, HE'S DEFIED HISTORY I THINK THE ODDS ARE REPUBLICANS WILL STILL TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. IN A WEIRD WAY THAT WILL BE A REALLY GOOD THING FOR JOE BIDEN AND I BELIEVE THE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE KEVIN McCARTHY IS GOING TO HAVE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE PICK JOE BIDEN APART. AND WHATEVER BODY PART, WHATEVER REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE ARE GOING TO BE FORCED TO JUST OBSTRUCT AND INVESTIGATE AND TRY TO IMPEACH. THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. AND JOE BIDEN CAN RESPOND TO THAT.  SORRY DID YOU WANT TO --  I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, JOE SAID HE'S NOT A DEMOCRAT. YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE. YOU'D LIKE TO BE A REPUBLICAN. WHAT DOES THAT DO FOR YOU ON THAT FRONT? WHAT HAPPENS TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY AND THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT AS A RESULT OF TONIGHT?  ALI, I LOVE THE DISCUSSION YOU AND I HAVE. BECAUSE WE DO ALWAYS KIND OF GO AT IT, AND I GIVE YOU A VERY UNSATISFACTORY ANSWER.  ALWAYS.  I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER GO AFTER THIS REPUBLICAN PARTY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S EVER GOING TO CHANGE. SO FOR CONSERVATIVES LIKE ME AND LIZ CHENEY, AND THERE ARE A BUNCH OF US OUT THERE. LOOK, OUR JOB AT THIS POINT IN HISTORY IS TO SUPPORT DEMOCRATS AND THAT'S HARD TO STOMACH AT TIMES, BUT THE DEMOCRATS SUPPORT DEMOCRACY, BUT MOST CONSERVATIVES ON THE ELECTION CYCLE.  JOE, IT'S JONATHAN CAPEHART, I WANT TO GO BACK TO KEVIN McCARTHY AND THE POTENTIAL OF HIS SPEAKERSHIP BECAUSE I'M TOTALLY NERDING OUT ON THE FACT THAT THIS NARROW MARGIN, THIS PROJECTED MARGIN, IS GOING TO MAKE HIS ABILITY TO GOVERN REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT. I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S GOING TO MAKE THE POSSIBILITY OF KEVIN McCARTHY BEING SPEAKER REALLY, REALLY HARD. DO YOU THINK HIS POTENTIAL SPEAKERSHIP IS IN DANGER BECAUSE OF THE FREEDOM CAUCUS AND THE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENS AND THE MATT GAETZES WHO MIGHT WANT TO HAVE SOMEBODY A LITTLE MORE TRUMPIER?  JONATHAN, I AGREE. LOOK, I THINK KEVIN McCARTHY WHO I KNOW WELL WHO IS A HOLLOW MAN, HE HAS NO CORE. ALL HE WANTS TO DO IS BECOME SPEAKER. HE CUT A DEAL WITH MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE SAND MATT GAETZ AND ALL THE REST OF THEM TO BECOME SPEAKER, AS LONG AS THEY GAVE THEM THINGS. BUT HE'S NOT GOING TO BECOME SPEAKER WITH A VERY CONVINCING VICTORY. THAT MAY JEOPARDIZE HIS ABILITY TO BECOME SPEAKERS. BUT HERE'S THE DEAL, IF McCARTHY IS SPEAKER, THAT MEANS MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE IS SPEAKER -- PERIOD. SHE WILL OWN HIM. SHE WILL TELL HIM PRIVATELY AND PUBLICLY WHAT TO DO. I MEAN THAT. THAT'S THE TWO YEARS McCARTHY WOULD BE LOOKING AT.  JOE, I WANT TO ASK YOU, ONE MORE QUESTION, SINCE I'VE GOT YOU, ONE MORE PERSONALITY, RON DeSANTIS, GOVERNOR DeSANTIS WINNING REECONNECTION BY 20 POINTS. TO MY MIND -- YOU TELL ME, I'M THINKING THAT RON DeSANTIS JUST FREED HIMSELF FROM THE CLUTCHES OF DONALD TRUMP. AND IS NOW HIS OWN PERSON. AND CAN TELL DONALD TRUMP TO GO STUFF IT. AM I GIVING HIM TOO MUCH CREDIT?  OH, JONATHAN, WAY TOO MUCH CREDIT. LOOK, HEY.  IT'S 4:00 A.M.  IT'S INTERESTING TO PUT OUT THERE. I DON'T THINK RON DeSANTIS IS READY FOR PRIME TIME. RON DeSANTIS CAN'T TAKE A PUNCH. RON DeSANTIS CAN'T GET IN THE RING WITH DONALD TRUMP. LOOK, EVERY REPUBLICAN POWER BROKER AND DONOR AND INFLUENCER IS DYING FOR DONALD TRUMP TO LEAVE THE SCENE. THEY FELT THAT WAY A WEEK AGO. THEY FELT THAT WAY FOUR WEEKS AGO -- MONTHS AGO. THEY'VE NEVER HAD THE COURAGE TO SAY THAT. BUT REPUBLICAN VOTERS ARE STILL WITH TRUMP. AND IF HE COMES OUT AND ANNOUNCES IN TWO WEEKS OR A WEEK, WHICH I THINK HE WILL, I JUST DON'T THINK RON DeSANTIS IS EQUIPPED TO COMPETE WITH THAT.  JOE, GOOD TO SEE YOU AS ALWAYS. THANKS FOR SAYING UP SO LATE. OR STARTING YOUR WEDNESDAY SO EARLY FOR US, AS ALWAYS.  GREAT, EVERYBODY, THANKS.  FORMER CONGRESSMAN OF ILLINOIS.  INTERESTING. 20221109093354.277|20221109093601.454",

        "trs": "\u266a\u266a > YOU'LL REMEMBER EARLIER THIS YEAR, KANSAS HAD A REFERENDUM ABOUT ABORTION. IT IS ENSHRINED AS A RIGHT IN KANSAS. THERE'S A VOTE TO ACTUALLY TAKE IT OFF. THAT WAS DEFEATED. WE HAD FOUR BALLOT QUESTIONS TONIGHT ABOUT ABORTION. I WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE RESULTS OF ALL OF THEM. THIS ONE WAS IN VERMONT. THE QUESTION IS THE RIGHT TO REPRODUCTIVE ATAUTONOMY. 72%. THAT'S ENOUGH TO CALL IT. LET'S GO TO MICHIGAN. PROPOSAL 3, TALKED ABOUT A LOT, ENSHRINED IN THE MICHIGAN CONSTITUTION. VOTE WAS CLOSER THERE. 55% TO 44%. WE'LL SEE THAT SETTLE IN. YOU ALSO AWE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR WINNING IN MICHIGAN. WE'VE GOT THAT. HAPPENING. LET'S GO TO CALIFORNIA WHERE ABORTION QUESTION IS THE RIGHT TO ABORTION. 45% IN, BUT BECAUSE OF THE TREND IN CALIFORNIA, WE'RE ABLE TO CALL THAT, THE DIFFERENCE IS ACTUALLY QUITE LARGE, 1.6 MILLION, 65% TO 34%. THOSE NUMBERS MAY CHANGE OVER TIME. BUT WE'RE CALLING THAT A WIN AS WELL. KENTUCKY THIS IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S NOT IN LINE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE THAT'S HAPPENING IN ELECTIONS IN THAT STATE, THIS IS TO REMOVE THE RIGHT TO ABORTION. THIS IS OPPOSITE. THE VOTE IS, WOULD YOU LIKE TO REMOVE THE RIGHT TO ABORTION. I DON'T THINK WE'VE CALLED THIS YET, 82% OF THE VOTES ARE IN ON THIS ONE. AND THE NO, DON'T REMOVE THE RIGHT TO ABORTION CONTINUES TO BE AHEAD. AND IT'S BEEN AHEAD FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT. AGAIN, IT'S CLOSE, 33,000 VOTES. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS ONE. THERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION I WANT TO SHOW YOU, THIS ONE IS IN MONTANA. VERY UNUSUAL, REFERENDUM QUESTION 131. TO REQUIRE CARE FOR INFANTS BORN ALIVE. REQUIRE DOCTORS TO PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE FOR INFANTS BORN ALIVE. I DON'T REALLY KNOW OF ANY INSTANCES, FOR A LONG TIME WHERE A DOCTOR HAS REFUSED CARE FOR AN INFANT BORN ALIVE. IT'S A WEIRD QUESTION. BUT, YOU'RE SEEING HERE, 78% IN, 78% OF THE VOTES IN. IT DOES SEEM TO BE AN ABORTION QUESTION WHICH IS HOW PEOPLE HAVE VOTED AND THE NO SIDE IS WINNING VERSUS THE YES SIDE. INTERESTING IN ALL OF THE CASES WE KNOW OF, THREE OF THE FIVE CASES, WE'VE GOT A SITUATION WHERE ABORTION RIGHTS HAVE BEEN AFFIRMED. IN TWO, IT'S NOT BEEN SETTLE ED YET, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING THAT WAY. IN EVERY INSTANCE WHERE AN ABORTION QUESTION WAS ASKED, THE ABORTION RIGHT SIDE OF THINGS SEEM TO HAVE EMERGED. I WANT TO BE CAREFUL OF THE WAY I'VE PHRASED. BECAUSE OF THE WEIRDNESS OF HOW MONTANA HAS ASKED THAT QUESTION. OF COURSE, EARLIER THIS YEAR, WE SAW KANSAS, RIGHT, WHERE IT'S NOT A REFLECTION OF WHETHER PEOPLE LIKE ABORTION RIGHTS OR NOT. ALICIA, YOU WERE MAKING THE POINT, IT FELT MORE LIKE PEOPLE SAYING DON'T TAKE MY RIGHTS AWAY?  RIGHT. I WANT TO READ A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE REFERENDUM, IN MONTANA, THIS IS WHAT WE SEE WITH THE REFERENDUMS AND THE WAY THEY'RE WORDED.  THEY'RE CONFUSING.  THEY'RE CONFUSING. PART OF THE DOCTORS CONCERN, THE LAW WILL ADMIT PALLIATIVE CARE FOR INFANTS THAT SURVIVE. WE TALK ABOUT ABORTIONS THAT HAPPEN DURING A PREGNANCY THAT IS ADVANCED VERY OFTEN IS A MEDICAL INTERVENTION ON THE PART OF A DOCTOR, EITHER BECAUSE THERE IS RISK TO THE MOTHER OR TO THE BABY. THIS, AGAIN, YOU SEE THE WAY IT IS WORDED. YOU SEE THE LANGUAGE, RIGHT, OF THE NAME OF THE REFERENDUM KIND OF SAYS IT ALL.  RIGHT. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE FOUND IN INSTANCES ALL ACROSS AMERICA. WHERE WE'VE TALKED TO PEOPLE ABOUT THIS CONCEPT OF DOCTORS BEING HELD LIABLE FOR ABORTION MATTERS, BECAUSE THE ISSUE BECOMES DOCTORS AREN'T MAKING THIS LEGISLATION. THERE ISN'T SOMEBODY WHO IS A LEGISLATOR IN THAT ROOM WITH THE PREGNANT PERSON MAKING THAT DECISION. SO, NOW, YOU'VE GOT -- THERE'S ONE STATE, I CAN'T REMEMBER WHERE IT WAS, THEY JUST -- THEY JUST STOPPED PROVIDING ABORTIONS BECAUSE NO ONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT LAWYER YOU NEED TO MAKE WHAT DECISION IN ORDER TO DO IT.  AND THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ALL OF YOU, I'VE SPOKEN TO PROVIDERS WHERE THEY SAY, I AM IN A MOMENT WHERE I HAVE TO MAKE A CRITICAL MEDICAL DECISION. AND IN THAT MOMENT, I KNOW --  CALL THE LAWYERS.  IN THAT MOMENT, I SAY CALL THE LAWYERS WHICH BOTH SLOWS DOWN CARE, REDUCES QUALITY OF CARE. AND ADDS AN ENTIRE GRAY ELEMENT TO WHAT SHOULD BE OTHERWISE BE MEDICALLY BASED AND SCIENTIFIC.  IN A CASE WHERE PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT A CASE WHERE THAT PARTICULAR ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY WANT TO MAKE.  AND TO TALK BACK TO THIS, AND YOU THINK ABOUT COMMON SENSE TO PEOPLE, AND IF YOU'RE A PERSON WHO HAS SOUGHT HEALTH CARE IN THIS COUNTRY, YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT YOUR DOCTOR ON THE PHONE WITH AN ATTORNEY DETERMINING --  DETERMINING YOUR CARE.  WITH GREG ABBOTT IN HIS CAMPAIGN, IT WAS THIS VERY POWERFUL AD OF A WOMAN WITH HER HUSBAND TALKING TO THE DOCTOR. AND THE DOCTOR TELLS THEM, YOU KNOLL, YOU'RE GOING TO TO HAVE TO MAKE A VERY DIFFICULT CHOICE. BUT BEFORE HE DOES, HE GOES AND PICKS UP THE PHONE AND HE CALLS GREG ABBOTT TO FIND OUT WHETHER OR NOT HE CAN PROCEED. IT'S A VERY TOUGH AD FOR MOMS IN TEXAS FOR BETO. I THINK TO YOUR POINT, BARACK OBAMA IN HIS FINAL MESSAGES BOTH IN PENNSYLVANIA AND WISCONSIN TALKED ABOUT ABORTION. I THINK HEDELIVERED A VERY GOOD MESSAGE WHICH IS THERE ARE GOOD PEOPLE WITH GOOD CONSCIENCE WHO DISAGREE WITH ME ABOUT ABORTION, BUT ALL OF US CAN AGREE A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT HER OWN BODY. THAT'S THE MESSAGE IN THE CAMPAIGN.  FREEDOM.  FREEDOM.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THE RESULTS OF THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS HERE ON MSNBC. STAY WITH US. \u266a\u266a 20221109094205.718|20221109094640.292",

        "trs": " JOINING US NOW, RICK HASSAN IS PROFESSOR OF LAW AND POLITICAL SCIENCE AT THE UCLA SCHOOL OF LAW, THE DIRECTOR OF SAFEGUARDING DEMOCRACY PROJECT AND AN MSNBC ELECTION LAW ANALYST. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. WE HAVE ALL BEEN SPEAKING ABOUT THE FATE OF DEMOCRACY AS WE KNOW IT AHEAD OF THIS ELECTION. WE ARE DO YOU SEE DEMOCRACY GOING AFTER TONIGHT?  THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT, IN AT LEAST SOME PLACES, ELECTION DENIERS DID NOT GET ELECTED TO OFFICE. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IS -- DOUG MASTRIANO, WHO IS RUNNING TO BE GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA. HE LOST HIS ELECTION, HE WOULD HAVE HAD THE POWER TO APPOINT A SECRETARY OF STATE. HE HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE CERTIFIED THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2020 FOR JOE BIDEN. SO, THAT'S ONE RISK THAT HAS DISAPPEARED. WE ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF TRUMPIST CANDIDATES CONCEDING THEIR ELECTIONS. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOOD NEWS. IT'S A LOW BAR. BUT IT'S GOOD NEWS. STILL WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN ARIZONA. I THINK THAT'S GRAND ZERO FOR ALL OF THIS. IT'S TOO EARLY TO KNOW HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO PLAY OUT THERE. AND SOMEONE OF KARI LAKE, IF SHE LOSES THE GOVERNOR'S ELECTION, IF SHE'S ACTUALLY GOING TO CONCEDE HER ELECTION.  AND YOU HAVE WRITTEN ABOUT THE WAY ELECTION AND I'LL IS TAKING HOLD OF A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS. THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT SOME OF THE ELECTION DENIERS WE HAVE SEEN ON BALLOTS NATIONWIDE WIN. EXPLAIN WHAT THAT COULD MEAN FOR THE FUTURE OF ELECTIONS.  SO, PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE RUNNING IN ELECTIONS, TO 2020 ELECTION WAS STOLEN -- BELIEVE THIS, IN WHICH CASE THEY ARE GULLIBLE AND THEY PROBABLY SHOULD NOT BE RUNNING ELECTIONS, OR THEY'RE LYING, IN WHICH CASE IT IS HARD TO TRUST THEM. AND I THINK, EVEN IF SOME OF THESE ELECTION DENIERS RUN THEIR ELECTIONS AS FAIRLY AS POSSIBLE, THERE IS GOING TO BE NEW DOUBTS ON THE LEFT WIN THESE ELECTION DENIERS ARE GOING TO RUN OUT ELECTION RESULTS. I'M WORRIED WE ARE GOING TO GET INTO A CYCLE WHERE EVEN MORE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOSE FAITH IN OUR PROCESS. YOU CANNOT HAVE A DEMOCRACY UNLESS PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS AND THE RESULTS ANNOUNCE ACTUALLY REFLECT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.  AND IN ADDITION -- HEY, IT'S ALICIA MENENDEZ -- IN ADDITION TO ELECTION DENIERS, THERE ARE ALSO ELECTION DENIERS, CONSPIRACY THEORISTS, SOME OF WHICH EXIST ON THE FAR-RIGHT FRINGES OF THE INTERNET. -- IT REALLY UNDERMINES FAITH IN THE ENTIRE PROCESS. AND I WONDER, EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT ELECTED TONIGHT, THAT IS STILL BAKED, RIGHT? THAT IS STILL IN THE ETHER. HOW DO YOU UNDO THAT PIECE, THAT BASIC DISTRUST?  RIGHT. IT IS REALLY A PROBLEM. GETTING PEOPLE TRUST BACK IN THIS ERA, WITH MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION SPREADING SO EASILY, NOT JUST ON SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT ON CERTAIN NEWS NETWORKS AND THE WHOLE NETWORK OF PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING MONEY BY SPREADING ELECTION LIES AND FEEDING PEOPLE LIES TO MAKE THEM FEEL BETTER ABOUT ELECTION LOSSES -- THAT IS NOT GOING TO GO AWAY. AND SO REALLY, WHAT YOU NEED TO DO, IS FIND A COALITION OF REASONABLE PEOPLE FROM THE LEFT AND THE RIGHT TO AGREE IN PRINCIPLES OF FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. I DO HAVE SOME HOPE OF SEEING SOME OF THE RESULTS TONIGHT THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GOING TO REJECT THE MOST EXTREME CANDIDATES AND SUPPORT THOSE WHO WANT TO CONTINUE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.  I LIKE THAT. COALITION OF REASONABLE PEOPLE. RICK HASSAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE. AND STAY WITH US. MORE CONTINUING ELECTION COVERAGE IS NEXT. COVERAGE IS NEXT  ALL RIGHT, WE MAY NOT FIND OUT THE FINAL CONFIGURATION OF THE SENATE UNTIL DECEMBER BECAUSE, AS STEVE WAS JUST EXPLAINING, THE GEORGIA SENATE RACE, IF NO CANDIDATE RECEIVES MORE THAN 50% OF THE VOTE IN GEORGIA, THAT RACE WILL GO TO A RUNOFF BETWEEN THE TOP TWO CANDIDATES. AND THAT RACES STILL TOO CLOSE TO CALL BUT A RUNOFF BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK AND HIS REPUBLICAN CHALLENGER HERSCHEL WALKER IS LOOKING POSSIBLE AT THE MOMENT. THE OTHER BIG RACE IN GEORGIA TONIGHT, THE GUBERNATORIAL RACE, REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT BRIAN KEMP ONCE AGAIN BEATING STACEY ABRAMS. LET'S GO LIVE TO -- ALISON BARBER AND BLAINE ALEXANDER ARE STANDING BY. ALISON, AND THIS LATE IN THE NIGHT, YOU ARE AT THE HERSCHEL WALKER CAMPAIGN. TELL US A BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU ARE SEEING. AND HOW THEY ARE FEELING AS THESE RESULTS ROLL IN.  HEY, AYMAN. AS YOU SAID, WE HAVE NOT CALLED THIS RACE. BUT THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE JUST TWEETED, WHILE COUNTY OFFICIALS ARE STILL DOING THE DETAILED WORK ON COUNTING THE VOTES, WE FEEL IT IS SAFE TO SAY THERE WILL BE A RUNOFF FOR THE U.S. SENATE HERE IN GEORGIA SLATED FOR DECEMBER 6TH. AND THAT IS A TWEET FROM GABE STERLING. AS FOR THE CANDIDATES, THE MOOD, BOTH WALKER AND WARNOCK DELIVERED SIMILAR MESSAGES TO SUPPORTERS TONIGHT, SAYING THIS IS GOING TO BE A VERY LONG NIGHT. BUT WE FEEL GOOD. THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE HERE, THEY SAY THERE IS STILL ABOUT 33,000 EARLY VOTES OUTSTANDING THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN COUNTED IN COLUMBIA COUNTY. THAT IS A COUNTY THAT DONALD TRUMP WON BACK IN 2020 WITH 62% OF THE VOTE. BIDEN HAD 36% THERE. WALKER'S CAMPAIGN, HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM -- THEY ARE POINTING TO THAT COUNTY, THOSE OUTSTANDING BALLOTS, AS A POSITIVE SIGN FOR THEIR CANDIDATE. WHEN I LAST SPOKE TO THEM, THEY WERE CONFIDENT, ADAMANT, THAT THEY THINK THEY CAN EKE OUT A WIN. AT THE SAME, TIME WARNOCK'S CAMPAIGN IS ALSO TELLING US THEY FEEL REALLY GOOD. A SOURCE CLOSE TO WARNOCK'S CAMPAIGN TOLD ME THAT THEY ALWAYS KNEW IT WOULD COME DOWN TO THE WIRE. BUT SECURING A RUNOFF IN THIS ENVIRONMENT WITH SQUEAKING OUT AN OUTRIGHT WIN WOULD BE BIG EITHER WAY. RIGHT NOW, WALKER AND WARNOCK ARE A LITTLE UNDER 14,000 VOTES BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. YOU SAID IT OFF THE TOP. STEVE HAS SAID IT MULTIPLE TIMES TONIGHT. BUT THE MAGIC NUMBER HERE IS REALLY 50.01% IF NO CANDIDATE HITS THAT THRESHOLD IT GOES TO A RUNOFF IN DECEMBER. AND RIGHT NOW THE NUMBERS THAT WE ARE SEEING, WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE, IT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL NOT HAVE A WINNER IN THIS ANYTIME SOON.  ELLISON, STAY WITH US, WE ARE GOING TO CROSS OVER TO BLAINE ALEXANDER, OUTSIDE OF THE STACEY ABRAMS HEADQUARTERS. -- BLAINE, A VERY DIFFERENT NIGHT -- A LOT OF MOMENTUM GOING IN BEHIND HER IN THIS RACE. IT JUST DID NOT PAN OUT. HOW ARE THEY TAKING THE LOSS? HOW ARE THEY EXPLAINING THE LOSS AT THIS MOMENT?  YOU KNOW, AYMAN, I THINK ONE OF THE MOST STRIKING THINGS TO LOOK AT HERE WITH THIS OUTCOME IS THE MARGIN. AS YOU SAID, THIS WAS A RE-. MAX REMATCH. -- BACK THEN IT WAS LESS THAN TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS. TONIGHT SHE LOST MORE MORE THAN EIGHT PERCENTAGE POINTS, CERTAINLY A MUCH LARGER MARGIN OF VICTORY FOR BRIAN KEMP. HAVEN'T COVERED POLITICS HERE IN GEORGIA, I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS THAT PEOPLE WILL POINT TO FOR THAT. BRIAN KEMP WAS A TRUMP ENDORSED CANDIDATE. HE WAS SOMEONE WHO RAN BRANDISHING A SHOTGUN AND OTHER THINGS. -- THIS TIME AROUND, LIKELY ALIENATED SOME VOTERS WHO THOUGHT HE WAS TOO FAR TO THE RIGHT. HE STRATEGY THIS TIME AROUND WAS TO REALLY FOCUS ON HIS RECORD, POINT TO HIS RECORD OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF GOVERNING AND HOPE TO WIN OVER SOME PERHAPS MODERATE REPUBLICANS WHO DID NOT VOTE FOR HIM LAST TIME AROUND. THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT -- VICTORY. AND OTHER THING, THOUGH, IS OF COURSE WE LOOK BACK TO 2020, THAT'S WHERE -- AND THAT'S ALSO BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKED AT AND SAID, OKAY, THIS COULD HAVE BEEN MAKINGS FOR A CC ABRAMS VICTORY. THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT TERRITORY NOW THAN WE WERE BACK IN 2020. SO, IT MADE THE COMMENT ANYWAY THAT DEMOCRATS RALLY BEHIND GETTING TRUMP AROUND OUT OF OFFICE. THAT'S NO LONGER THE CASE IN THE SOMETHING THAT LIKELY HURTS ACA ROOMS IN THE. AND HERE'S SOME OF WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY FOLLOWED BY BRIAN KEMP'S VICTORY SPEECH.  LET ME BEGIN BY OFFERING CONGRATULATIONS TO GOVERNOR BRIAN KEMP. OUR STATE HAS EXPERIENCED ONE SOUL CRUSHING CRISIS AFTER ANOTHER OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. BUT EVEN DURING THESE TRYING TIMES, THE FIGHTING SPIRIT OF GEORGIA HAS PREVAILED.  THE MEDIA, THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATS, THOSE BILLIONAIRE DONORS, THE LEFT WING ACTIVISTS, JOE BIDEN, BARACK OBAMA, OPRAH, AND STACEY ABRAMS THREW EVERYTHING THEY HAD AT US FOR THE SECOND TIME IN A ROW. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID, Y'ALL? WE KEPT -- AND THEN TONIGHT. WE KEPT SHOPPING IT. TONIGHT, WE STOPPED STACEY AND SAVED GEORGIA.  AND AYMAN, A QUICK NOTE ABOUT THE MOOD INSIDE THE ROOM AT STACEY ABRAMS CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS. -- FIERY SPEECH, ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT WE MIGHT NOT LIKE THE RESULT TONIGHT, BUT THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER CHAPTER. AYMAN?  ALL RIGHT, NBC'S BLAYNE ALEXANDER AND ELLISON BARBER TONIGHT, THANK YOU. --  A RESIDENT GEORGIAN --  RIGHT, FORMER, FORMER. I THINK IT'S A FASCINATING CASE, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DYNAMICS OF WHAT'S PLAYING OUT TONIGHT, BRIAN KEMP HANDILY DEFEATED STACEY ABRAMS IN EVERY MATCH THAT MANY PEOPLE I, THINK, THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE MUCH CLOSER. -- YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT CANDIDATE QUALITY, I DON'T THINK OF ALL THE CANDIDATES THAT HAVE RUN IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE, HERSCHEL WALKER IS -- WHEN MCCONNELL'S --  HERSCHEL WALKER IS THE --  POSTER CHILD OF THAT QUALITY.  AND HE TRIPPED UP SEVERAL TIMES AFTER MCCONNELL --  TRIPPED UP? YEAH, HE TRIPPED UP. BUT ALL THESE CHILDREN CAME FROM OUT OF EVERYWHERE. THEN, OTHER STORIES OF DEMANDING THAT GIRLFRIENDS HAVE ABORTIONS. I GUESS, TO CANDIDATE QUALITY, THE IDEA HAS ALWAYS BEEN, TO ME, GALLING, THAT THIS RACE BETWEEN HERSCHEL WALKER AND REVEREND SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK WAS EVEN CLOSE.  AND HERE WE ARE, POSSIBLY GOING INTO A RUNOFF.  POSSIBLY GOING INTO A RUNOFF, WHICH, I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN THEN HAVE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, ESPECIALLY THAT THIRD PARTY GUY, WHO WAS SIPHONED OFF SO MANY VOTES --  OLIVER --  DECISIVE WIN --  EXCEPT, ALICIA, THE RUNOFF BECOMES A NATIONAL ELECTION. -- ONCE AGAIN IN 2020. THIS COULD BE THE DECIDING FACTOR IN WHO CONTROLS --  A LOT OF IT COMES DOWN TO GETTING PEOPLE RE-EXCITED, SAYING, -- I KNOW -- MUSCLE MEMORY, AS DO THOSE ORGANIZERS AND -- I NEED TO SAY, THOUGH, STACEY ABRAMS HAS PROVEN HERSELF TO BE A TRANSFORMATIONAL POLITICAL CHARACTER. THAT DOES NOT CHANGE WITH THE ELECTORAL LOSS. I THINK IT WOULD ALSO BE A MISTAKE -- A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT THE STATE AND THEY WILL SAY, NOT ONLY DID STACEY ABRAMS LOSE, BUT HER PLAYBOOK LOST. HER ARGUMENT THAT YOU NEED TO INVEST OVER A PERIOD OF TIME AND GO INTO COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE ORDINARILY BEEN NEGLECTED AND THEN PUT A BIG LONGITUDINAL INVESTMENT THERE, THAT LESSON NEEDS TO STICK. THERE IS STILL AN ARGUMENT FOR WHAT SHE HAS BEEN DOING.  LET'S ALSO REMEMBER THAT, YES, SHE WAS A CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR, BUT SHE ALSO FORMED AN ORGANIZATION. SHE'S NOT JUST A CANDIDATE. -- FROM THE GROUND UP, AND WE ARE GOING TO SEE THAT APPARATUS AT PLAY IF, IN THE, GEORGIA GOES TO A RUNOFF.  100%. CANDIDATES COME AND GO. THAT INFRASTRUCTURE, SO LONG -- YEAH, IT'S FOREVER.  -- PEOPLE SAID THAT SHE SINGLE-HANDEDLY DELIVERED THE TWO SENATE SEATS IN 2020, JON OSSOFF AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK, PRECISELY BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID THERE. -- ABLE TO GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE IF THEY NEEDED IT. -- RUNOFF ON DECEMBER 6TH, I BELIEVE IT IS.  DECEMBER 6TH.  -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS, BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT GEORGIA, QUITE POSSIBLY, FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. WE HAVE 96% OF THE VOTE IN THEIR. AND WE CALL IT TOO CLOSE TO CALL. AT SOME JUNCTURE, THIS MOVES FROM BEING TOO CLOSE TO CALL TO, IT'S A RUNOFF. THE SECRETARY OF STATE, BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, BY THE, WAY HAS BEEN REELECTED THERE. THIS WILL BE DECIDED TO BE A RUNOFF IF NO ONE GETS TO 49, THE 50%. RIGHT NOW IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT OR TOMORROW NIGHT. IT MAY NOT HAPPEN, IN OTHER WORDS, WE MIGHT GO TO A RUNOFF. TAKE A LOOK AT THE MAP OF GEORGIA AND HOW THIS HAS LIVED THERE. AYMAN, YOU HAVE LIVE, THERE I HAVE LIVED THERE. WHAT HAS EVOLVED THERE IS THAT YOU'VE GOT CERTAIN CENTERS AROUND WHICH DEMOCRATS WIN AND THEN THE REST OF THE STATE, INCLUDING WHERE MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE RUNS, FOR INSTANCE, WHERE SOMETIMES A DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE -- DID ACTUALLY RUN AGAINST HER. BUT YOU HAVE GOT A NINE COUNTIES AROUND ATLANTA, WHICH ARE DECISIVE. VOTER TURNOUT MATTERS HERE. IT'S AROUND SAVANNAH, AROUND AUGUSTA, AROUND COLUMBUS. AND THEN SOME OTHER PLACES -- THIS IS HOW GEORGIA GETS DECIDED. WE ARE DO PEOPLE COME OUT TO VOTE? AND THAT, TO ALICIA'S POINT, ABOUT STACEY ABRAMS, IT'S REALLY A LOT ABOUT STACEY ABRAMS. SHE ORCHESTRATED. SHE AND OTHER ORGANIZERS IN GEORGIA, WHO REMAINED THE EXAMPLE FOR AMERICA IN TERMS OF ORGANIZING ARE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE FIGURED OUT, ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE GOT PEOPLE IN HERE WHO ARE GOING TO VOTE DEMOCRATIC. HOW DO WE GET THEM TO REGISTER? HOW DO WE OVERCOME HURDLES TO REGISTRATION? HOW DO WE GET THEM TO VOTE ON ELECTION DAY. YOU LOOK AT THE ABORTION QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ON THE BALLOT, STARTING IN KANSAS IN THE SUMMER. BUT TONIGHT IN MICHIGAN, AND KENTUCKY, IT'S SO CLOSE. I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE CALLED THAT YET BUT THERE IS A VOTE TO BAN ABORTION IN THE CONSTITUTION. THAT IS NOT SUCCEEDING OR WAS NOT SUCCEEDING AS OF AN HOUR. AGO WE HAVE GOTTEN ABORTION QUESTION IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE A FEW OTHERS ON THE BALLOT. THESE ARE ORGANIZATIONAL POLITICS. STACEY ABRAMS ON SATURDAY, WHEN I TALK TO HER, SAID THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE POLLING. IT'S ABOUT WHO COMES OUT TO VOTE AND WHETHER THEY CAN VOTE. SO, STACEY ABRAMS LOST HER ELECTION, THE REVEREND SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK HAS NOT WON HIS ELECTION TONIGHT AND MAY HAVE TO FACE A RUNOFF. BUT WHAT YOU HAVE GOT HERE IS NOT JUST DEMOGRAPHICS. BUT IT'S THE IDEA THAT IN GEORGIA, WHICH, TO ME, STILL REMAINS GROUND ZERO FOR THIS EFFORT TO SAY, YOUR VOTE MATTERS, YOU CAN CHANGE THE HISTORY OF WHAT HAPPENS, BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE -- AND I SUSPECT THAT TONIGHT, IT DOESN'T GET RESULTS TONIGHT OR TOMORROW NIGHT OR WHATEVER THE CASE IS, AND WE MAY STILL BE LOOKING AT THE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE UNTIL DECEMBER WHEN THAT RUNOFF TAKES PLACE. BUT WHEN IT IS USEFUL TO, REMEMBER WHEN YOU LOOK AT MAPS OF GEORGIA AND PENNSYLVANIA, AND EVEN ARIZONA, THAT IT IS THE CENTERS OF POPULATION, HOW THEY HAVE A MERGE AND HOW PEOPLE GO OUT TO ACTUALLY CAST THEIR BALLOTS AND HOW ORGANIZERS DEPEND ON THAT.  ALI VELSHI, THINK YOU VERY MUCH. STICK AROUND, WE WILL SQUEEZE IN A QUICK BREAK AND PICK IT UP RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. NYWHERE. AH, THESE BILLS ARE CRAZY. SHE HAS NO IDEA SHE'S SITTING ON A GOLDMINE. WELL SHE DOESN'T KNOW THAT IF SHE OWNS A LIFE INSURANCE POLICY OF $100,000 OR MORE SHE CAN SELL ALL OR PART OF IT TO COVENTRY FOR CASH. EVEN A TERM POLICY. EVEN A TERM POLICY? EVEN A TERM POLICY! FIND OUT IF YOU'RE SITTING ON A GOLDMINE. CALL COVENTRY DIRECT TODAY AT THE NUMBER ON YOUR SCREEN, OR VISIT COVENTRYDIRECT.COM.  NEARLY 35 MILLION -- ELIGIBLE TO VOTE IN ELECTIONS THIS YEAR. THAT IS ACCORDING TO PEW RESEARCH, MAKING THEM THE SECOND LARGEST ETHNIC GROUP OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS. TONIGHT, THE IMPACT OF THE LATINO VOTER HAS BEEN FELT ACROSS THE KEY STATES OF FLORIDA AND TEXAS AND IN SOME UNEXPECTED WAYS. JOINING ME NOW IS CRISTOBAL ALEX, PRESIDENT OF THE -- VICTORY PROJECT AND FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO THE JOE BIDEN CAMPAIGN AND MSNBC ANALYST. AND MARIA TERESA KUMAR, PRESIDENT OF VOTO LATINO. CRISTOBAL, I WANT TO START WITH YOU. AND ALL THE ATTENTION THAT WAS LAVISHED ON THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY, THOSE THREE DISTRICTS IN TO TEXAS -- THE ONE THAT WAS DRAWN FOR A REPUBLICAN WENT TO A -- WERE HELD BY DEMOCRATS. YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHAT HAPPENED THERE?  EXACTLY RIGHT. WHAT WE SAW ACROSS THE BOARD TONIGHT IS THAT THERE WAS NO RED WAVE. AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN IT COMES TO LATINOS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY, PEOPLE HAD WEIRD OFF THOSE CONGRESSIONAL SEATS SOMETIME AGO AND THAT'S WHY WE WAIT UNTIL ELECTION DAY TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS. OF COURSE YOU HAVE TO LATINO DEMOCRATS HOLD THEIR SEATS. OF COURSE, THE 15 DISTRICT WAS LOST BECAUSE OF REDISTRICTING. BUT A BIG NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS IN THE VALLEY. AND IT REALLY PUSHES BACK AGAINST THIS MISPERCEPTION THAT LATINOS ARE SOMEHOW TRENDING VERY AGGRESSIVELY TO REPUBLICANS. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE.  MARIA TERESA KUMAR, PART OF THE REASON WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AROUND WHETHER REPUBLICANS ARE MAKING INROADS WITH LATINOS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN FLORIDA. I WANT YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT WE SAW OUT OF FLORIDA, UNDERSTANDING THAT THE NARRATIVE FOR THE NIGHT WILL NOT BE WRITTEN UNTIL WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN ARIZONA AND WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN NEVADA.  ALICIA, WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION SO MANY TIMES. FLORIDA IS AN OUTLIER, NOT ONLY FOR THE DEMOCRATS IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY, BUT QUITE FRANKLY AS A WHOLE. AND CHRIS CHRISTIE WAS THE GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE AND THEY -- USED TO BE A REPUBLICAN, LET'S REMIND EACH OTHER OF THAT. WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING AT WHERE DOES THE LATINO VOTE MOVE WITH THE TREND, WHERE THE TEA LEAVES, IT IS A PLACE LIKE TEXAS, IT IS A PLACE LIKE GEORGIA, PENNSYLVANIA AND ARIZONA AND NEVADA. I SAY THIS BECAUSE THIS THE FUN FACT ABOUT FLORIDA IS THAT YOUNG LATINO VOTERS WILL NEVER ECLIPSE OLDER LATINO VOTERS IN FLORIDA. YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ALREADY ECLIPSE OLDER LATINO VOTERS? IN TEXAS, IN GEORGIA, IN PENNSYLVANIA, IN NEVADA, IN ARIZONA, IN COLORADO. AND THAT IS WHY VOTO LATINO -- STATES FOR THE LAST 15 YEARS. BECAUSE IN 2004, LATINO IS THE SECOND LARGEST DEMOGRAPHIC, BUT DIDN'T BECOME A VOTING AGE IN 2015. WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE NEED TO CULTIVATE THIS AUDIENCE ALL THE TIME AND TALKED TO THEM. WE STARTED THE SEGMENT SAYING THAT 34 MILLION LATINOS WERE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE THIS ELECTION. THAT'S TRUE. WHAT OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE IN THE LATINO COMMUNITIES THAT ONLY 16 MILLION OF US ARE REGISTERED. WE HAVE A VOTER REGISTRATION DEFICIT. THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE ALMOST 1 MILLION LATINO YOUTH TURNING 18 EVERY SINGLE YEAR. GREG ABBOTT KNOWS THIS. THAT'S WHY HE ONE OF THE REASONS HE CREATED SO MANY VOTING RESTRICTIONS -- IF YOU LIVED IN A DORM, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU COULD NOT REGISTER TO VOTE THERE. VOTO LATINO BROUGHT IN A LAWSUIT. IT'S STILL ON THE COURSE. BECAUSE HE RECOGNIZES -- YOUNG LATINO VOTE. AND THE ONLY THING -- HEAVILY GERRYMANDER DISTRICT WAS A LATINO ABLE TO --  CRIST\u00d3BAL ALEX, I WANT TO UNDERSCORE SOMETHING I ALREADY SAID, WHICH IS, WE STILL NEED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN ARIZONA, WE STILL NEED TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN NEVADA, THAT'S WHY YOU WILL HAVE ALI VELSHI AT THE FORD ALL NIGHT GIVING US THOSE NUMBERS. BUT GIVE US THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE. IF YOU ARE LEADER IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WHAT IS THE CONVERSATION -- ABOUT HOW LATINO VOTERS PERFORMED IN THIS ELECTION.  AND -- EXACTLY RIGHT.  WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN NEVADA AND ARIZONA AND OTHER PLACES, WHERE LATINOS REALLY DO HOLD A FUTURE IN THEIR HANDS. IN A PLACE LIKE NEVADA, YOU REALLY NEED ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE NEVADA VOTE TO WIN THERE. NOW WE ARE ON TRACK, ADVISING THE PARTY, A CANDIDATE AND OTHERS. I WOULD SAY, GREAT WORK GETTING TO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW. DEMOCRATS ARE IN THE FIGHT RIGHT NOW, SIMPLY, I THINK, IN A LOT OF THESE PLACES, SIMPLY BECAUSE OF LATINO VOTERS AND OTHER IMPORTANT PARTS OF WHAT I CALL THE BIDEN COALITION. YOUNG VOTERS INCLUDED, WOMEN VOTERS, AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS, ASIAN VOTERS, ESPECIALLY IN PLACES LIKE LAS VEGAS. BUT WE HAVE GOT TO WAIT AND SEE HOW THESE TURNOUT. THE LAST PIECE OF THIS I WILL SAY IS, WE HAVE GOT SOME INCREDIBLE NEW BLOOD COMING IN IN THE DEMOCRATIC -- AND I THINK WHAT IT TELLS US IS THAT THE FUTURE REALLY IS LATINO. BUT IT IS SUCH A -- WHILE THEY LEAN DEMOCRATIC AND THEY BELIEVE IN DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES, YOU REALLY HAVE TO CONTINUOUSLY TRY TO PERSUADE LATINO VOTERS, BECAUSE THEY ARE SO YOUNG AND FAST GROWING, WE'VE GOT TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE THEM. SO, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, LIKE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, I THINK, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF THIS, I THINK, THE MOST FAVORABLE -- CONTINUE TO PUSH ON POLICIES AND LEAN ON THE POLICIES THAT THE TEEN IS CARE MOST ABOUT.  -- THERE'S ALSO SOME BIG FIRSTS. MAXWELL FROST, DELHI ANA RAMIREZ, THE FIRST LATINO ELECTED FROM THE MIDWEST. IT'S AN INTERESTING MOMENT.  -- WITH MAXWELL FROST, HE'S THE FIRST GEN Z YEAR AND LATINO, OPENLY GAY, COMING OUT OF FLORIDA. -- NOT COMPLETELY. YOU ALSO SEE -- YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THE LARGEST LATINO OUTREACH WE HAVE EVER SEEN IN OUR NATION THIS WEEK. THOSE ARE GREAT ONCE. BUT BACK TO NEVADA AND ARIZONA, WE ARE SEEING LATINOS PERFORMING CLOSER TO 2018 LEVEL, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF YOUNG WHICH YOU KNOW VOTERS. AND THAT SHOULD BE OF CONCERN ONLY BECAUSE THE WAY MOST PEOPLE GO OUT AND -- LATINO VOTERS ARE HYPERTENSIVE TO VOTERS. -- WHICH SENIORS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY YOUNG IN ARIZONA AND NEVADA. -- IT'S GOING TO BE GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS DOING TERRIFIC WORK ON THE GROUND. --  CRIST\u00d3BAL ALEX, MARIA TERESA KUMAR, THINK YOU BOTH. YOU ALL KNOW I I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS NONSTOP. -- AGAIN, WE DO NOT HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION WE NEED, BECAUSE WE ARE WAITING FOR NEVADA, BECAUSE WE ARE WAITING FOR ARIZONA.  WE ARE GOING TO BE WAITING FOR A WHILE, BY THE WAY. -- I'VE BEEN READING STUFF A MARICOPA COUNTY. THEY ARE GOING TO BE COUNTING FOR A WHILE. I WILL REMIND PEOPLE OF THIS. WE ARE GOING TO GET KEEP GETTING MORE INFORMATION FROM ARIZONA EVERY HOUR. -- WE HAVE 55% OF THE VOTE IN NOW. AND THE DENIERS ARE NOT WINNING RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS INCREDIBLE. -- THEY HAVE RUN POWERFUL CAMPAIGNS. I WILL GIVE IT TO THEM. IT IS ACTUALLY, I THINK, MORE FUN TO BE AN ELECTION DENIER AND AN ELECTION DENIER LIAR THAN A REASONABLE HUMAN. BECAUSE IT'S MORE FUN. YOU CAN SAY MORE INTERESTING THINGS. -- AT THE MOMENT, MARK KELLY'S LEAD IN THAT RACE IS SUBSTANTIAL. STEVE KORNACKI WAS SAYING, THE REPUBLICANS NEED TO GAINS NOW -- AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NIGHT THEY ONLY NEEDED ONE GAME. BUT THEY ONLY NEEDED ONE SEAT. WE ARE NOT SURE WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN GEORGIA. THAT COULD BE A DEMOCRATIC LOSS IF RAPHAEL WARNOCK DOES NOT WIN IT IN THE RUNOFF. SO, THEIR HOPES ARE PINNED NOW WITH THE REMARKABLE HERSCHEL WALKER AS A CANDIDATE. -- THEY DID NOT GET IT IN PENNSYLVANIA, WITH JOHN FETTERMAN NOW -- WISCONSIN CONTINUES TO BE A CLOSE RACE, THAT'S UNDECIDED. BUT THAT'S ALREADY RON JOHNSON. HE'S A REPUBLICAN. THIS IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE MAP FOR VICTORY FOR THE CONTROL OF THE SENATE. THEY HAVE TO GET TWO OF THOSE THREE PLACES. GEORGIA, ARIZONA, AND NEVADA. WE ARE NOT LIKELY TO GET GEORGIA TONIGHT. HERE IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN WISCONSIN. 93% OF THE VOTE IS IN. IT'S VERY CLOSE. 37,542. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE VOTES WE'RE MANDELA BARNES HAS PERFORMED THE STRONGEST OR IS LIKELY TO HAVE COME IN. SO WE ARE STILL WAITING -- YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN RIGHT THERE. BUT IT WON'T MATTER IN TERMS OF CONTROL OF THE SENATE.  I HAD A WISCONSIN DEMOCRATIC OFFICIAL WHO REMINDED ME THAT THE FACT THAT WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS SENATE RACE -- THEY CALLED IT A STAGGERING ACHIEVEMENT IN AND OF ITSELF.  CORRECT. BUT RON JOHNSON, IF YOU RECALL, WHEN HE WAS ELECTED, WAS WHAT YOU CALLED A MAINSTREAM REPUBLICAN.  YEAH, AND HE TOOK THAT HARD TURN. DOWN TO ELECTION DENIALISM, THOUGH.  VERY HARD TURN.  I THINK IT'S INTERESTING AS WELL. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT AS WELL -- AND WAS CHRIS HAYES TALKING ABOUT IT EARLIER. -- YOU HAD THE GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN, OBVIOUSLY --  --  STAYING FIRMLY IN DEMOCRATIC HANDS. WE STILL DON'T KNOW. BUT POSSIBLY, THE SENATE SAYING IN -- WE SEE THAT AGAIN IN A PLACE LIKE GEORGIA. OBVIOUSLY, PENNSYLVANIA, YOU HAD THE DEFEAT AT THE HANDS OF JOSH SHAPIRO --  BUT EVEN THEY, OR THAT WAS AN INTERESTING RACE. BECAUSE JOSH SHAPIRO DEFEATED MASTRIANO BY SO MANY VOTES. AND THE FETTERMAN OZ RACE WAS THE CLOSER.  LET ME GIVE YOU ONE MORE TIP ABOUT WISCONSIN, THOUGH, WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING. IT ALWAYS SWINGS AGAINST THE PRESIDENTS PARTY 28 AT THE LAST 52 RACES. SO, WHAT EVS HAS PULLED OFF THEIR, IT'S PRETTY ANOMALOUS.  I WANT TO POINT OUT ONE OF THE THING ABOUT WISCONSIN AND THE CLOSING MESSAGE -- N THEY REFERENCED IT ON SUNDAY NIGHT WHICH TO HAVE HANDS IN. IT,  SENATOR JOHNSON'S CLOSING BLESSED WAS DECIDEDLY RACIST. AND RACHEL, AGAINST LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR MANDELA BARNES WHO OBVIOUSLY IS AFRICAN AMERICAN, AND THE IDEA THAT JOHNSON RAN ON THAT CLOSING ARGUMENT AND THAT RACE IS STILL AS CLOSE AS IT IS SAYS TO ME, THAT THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN SAW THROUGH WHAT RON JOHNSON WAS DOING AND DID NOT ALLOW RACISM AND FEAR DICTATE HOW THEY WERE GOING TO ABOUT. IF RACISM STILL HAD THE POWER IN A HOLD OVER THE ELECTORATE THAT IT HAS HAD IN THE PAST, I'M NOT SAYING RACISM IS OVER OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT -- DON'T GET ME WRONG, BUT IF IT HAD THE SAME POWER AS IT HAD IN THE PAST, WE WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT RON JOHNSON HAS HELD ONTO HIS SEAT.  RIGHT.  AND I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. NOW  ESPECIALLY SINCE IT WAS A STEADY DRUMBEAT OF THAT IN THIS CAMPAIGN --  FOR WEEKS IF NOT MONTHS FROM SENATOR JOHNSON.  THEY DECIDE TO MAKE THAT CLOSING ARGUMENT, AND YOU KNOW CLOSING ARGUMENTS WORK -- YOU LOOK AT ALL THE OPTIONS YOU GOT AND YOU SAY WHAT'S THE STICKIEST THING. IF THAT IS ALL THEY HAD, RIGHT? THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER MESSAGE TO PIVOT TO, ALL THEY HAD IS THAT ONE.  I CAN'T SAY, I GO BACK TO TALKING ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA END|20221109075955|2022-11-09_0700_US_MSNBC_Election_Night_Decision_2020 ",

        "trs": "> AS A WOMAN, AS A MOM, AS A SISTER, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN CHOICES TO MAKE. IT'S OUR BODY. IT'S OUR CHOICE, AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UPHOLD THAT.  WHAT SORT OF MOTIVATED YOU TO GET OUT EARLY AND VOTE?  JUST THE PRICE OF EVERYTHING AND THE ABORTION PRETTY MUCH TOO.  IT SHOULD BE LEGAL.  YOU WANT TO KEEP --  YEAH, IT'S A WOMAN'S RIGHT.  THE ISSUE OF ABORTION, YOU HAVE YOUR RIGHT. A WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS TO DO WITH HER BODY.  WE MUST PROTECT WOMEN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, THAT IS FIRST AND FOREMOST OUR OBLIGATION. EVERYBODY MUST VOTE. WE HAVE RIGHTS.  WOW, THOSE ARE VOTERS ACROSS COUNTRY IN THEIR OWN WORDS LAYING OUT WHAT MOTIVATED THEM TO SHOW UP AND VOTE TO ASSERT, TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHTS IN FIVE STATES THAT WOULD BE MICHIGAN, CALIFORNIA, KENTUCKY, MONTANA, AND VERMONT, VOTER REFERENDUMS HAVE ACTUALLY LITERALLY ON THE BALLOT. AND IN NINE OTHERS, THE OUTCOMES OF TODAY'S ELECTIONS COULD DRAMATICALLY IMPACT WOMEN'S ABILITY TO ACCESS ABORTION HEALTH CARE. WE'RE BACK WITH JOHN, CECILE, MATT AND JIM. YOU AND SOMEONE ELSE MENTIONED GOVERNOR WHITMER'S CAMPAIGN. LET ME SHOW YOU HER MESSAGE TIEING THIS TO THE ECONOMY.  THE ECONOMY AND ABORTION RIGHTS, THESE ARE ALL PART OF THE SAME CONVERSATION. HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT IN MICHIGAN PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET AHEAD. THE DECISION WHEN AND WHETHER TO BEAR A CHILD IS ONE OF THE MOST PROFOUND ECONOMIC DECISIONS A WOMAN WILL MAKE IN HER LIFETIME. THAT IS A DECISION THAT SHOULD BE SQUARELY UP TO HER, NOT THE GOVERNMENT IMPOSING NEW RESTRICTIONS AND FORCING WOMEN TO GIVE BIRTH. FORCING RAPE VICTIMS TO CARRY THE BABY OF THEIR ATTACKER. IT'S EXTREME AND IT'S OUT OF TOUCH, AND IT WILL HAVE INCREDIBLE IMPACTS ON WOMEN AND GIRLS IN THIS STATE.  CECILE, SHE'S RUN A SUPERB CAMPAIGN. SHE'S ALSO, I THINK, KNITTED THESE THINGS TOGETHER FOR NOT JUST DAYS AND WEEKS BUT FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS. THAT IS THE REALITY FOR WOMEN IN AMERICA.  RIGHT, AND I'M GLAD YOU ACTUALLY HAD THE GENTLEMAN THERE ALSO THAT YOU INTERVIEWED BECAUSE THIS ISN'T, OF COURSE, JUST A WOMEN'S ISSUE. THIS IS A FAMILY ISSUE. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS EVERYONE, AND WE THOUGH THAT AS GRETCHEN OR GOVERNOR WHITMER SAID, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT, IF NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT DECISION YOU MAKE IN YOUR LIFETIME IS WHEN AND WHETHER TO NOT ONLY HAVE A CHILD, BUT FRANKLY RAISE A FAMILY, AND OF COURSE ONE OF THE IRONIES THAT HAS BEEN LOST A LITTLE BIT IN THIS CONVERSATION IS THAT THE REPUBLICANS OPPOSE EVERY SINGLE EFFORT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE WHETHER IT'S THE CHILD TAX CREDIT, WHETHER IT IS AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE, THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI THAT OF COURSE GOT THIS WHOLE THING ROLLING, A STATE WHERE NEW MOTHERS ON MEDICAID GET TWO MONTHS OF HEALTH CARE AFTER DELIVERY, AND THE REPUBLICANS HAVE REFUSED REPEATEDLY TO EXPAND THAT. SO I THINK THE INTERESTING THING IS I THINK FOR POLITICAL PUNDITS SOMETIMES IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU TIE THESE TWO THINGS TOGETHER. I THINK FOR AVERAGE VOTERS AND EVERY AMERICANS, THEY UNDERSTAND THIS FUNDAMENTALLY, AND AGAIN, I THINK WOMEN TEND TO VOTE ON THIS ISSUE MORE STRONGLY THAN MEN, THAT MEN ARE AS SUPPORTIVE OF THESE RIGHTS AS WOMEN. AT GROUP TOO THAT WE DIDN'T MENTION, AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE'LL GET TO, BUT IS YOUNG VOTERS WHO THIS IS ACTUALLY THE MOST MOTIVATING ISSUE RIGHT NOW AND I WAS JUST LOOKING AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WISCONSIN WITH ENORMOUS SURGE IN YOUNG VOTER TURNOUT. I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING, AGAIN, THAT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE LONG-TERM IMPLICATIONS OF RESORTING PARTY AFFILIATION THAT HAVING A GOVERNMENT OR POLITICAL LEADERS WHO ARE GOING TO TAKE AWAY A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT YOUR BODY, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOUNG VOTERS ABSOLUTELY ARE OPPOSED TO, AND I'M GOING TO BE INTERESTED TO SEE HOW MOTIVATING IT IS FOR YOUNG VOTERS WHO ARE ALWAYS HARD TO TURN DOWN IN MIDTERM ELECTIONS. I THINK WE MAY HAVE SOME SURPRISES THERE AS WELL.  JOHN HEILEMANN, THE UNPOPULARITY OF OVERTURNING ROE VERSUS WADE IN AMERICA IN THE YEAR 2022 IS CLEAR NOT JUST TO ALL OF US AND ALL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES AND VOTERS, BUT TO ALL REPUBLICANS. THEY'RE NOT RUNNING ANY VICTORY LAP ADs. 50 PLUS PERCENT OF AMERICANS SUPPORTED LEAVING ROE THE LAW OF THE LAND. 83 PLUS OPPOSE ABORTION BANS THAT EXCLUDE EXCEPTIONS IN THE CASE OF RAPE OR INCEST, YET, THAT'S WHERE REPUBLICANS ARE HEADING. HOW DO YOU THINK THIS ISSUE IS PLAYING TO MATTHEW'S VERY PROVOCATIVE POINT ABOUT MAYBE SOME UNDER REPORTING OR A HIDDEN PRO-CHOICE VOTE?  WELL, LIKE I SAID BEFORE, NICOLLE, I THINK -- AND I'M PRETTY SURE CECILE HAS SEEN THIS HERSELF, YOU KNOW. THERE IS IN THE WAKE OF THE KANSAS VOTE AND IN THE REFERENDUM, WHICH SHOCKED A LOT OF PEOPLE WHEN ESSENTIALLY A VERY RED STATE VOTING -- OR WHAT'S THOUGHT TO BE A VERY RED STATE, HAS BEEN A VERY RED STATE, VOTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AUGUST AT A TIME WHEN THE WHOLE VOTE WAS SET UP, THE VOTE WAS SET UP IN A WAY TO TRY TO CONFUSE VOTERS ABOUT WHICH WAY TO VOTE. IT WAS PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER. IT WAS MADE -- THE IT WAS SET UP FOR THERE TO BE THE MAXIMUM REPUBLICAN TURNOUT AND THE MAXIMUM CONFUSION ON THE PART OF PRO-CHOICE VOTERS AND IT STILL ENDS UP GETTING, THAT REFERENDUM ENDS UP GOING IN THE PRO-CHOICE DIRECTION IN AN OVERWHELMING WAY IN A WAY THAT REFLECTED THE NATIONAL CONSENSUS ON ROE V. WADE. IT CAUSED A LOT OF CONSERVATIVE LAWMAKERS, A LOT OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS, STATE LEGISLATORS WHO HAD TAKEN DOBBS AS LICENSE TO GO AND TRY TO ENACT QUICKLY EITHER THROUGH TRIGGER LAWS OR THEIR OWN STATE LEGISLATIVE MECHANISMS TRY TO PUSH VERY EXTREME ABORTION LAWS. THEY ALL SORT OF STEPPED BACK. AND YOUR POINT IS RIGHT. AS A POLITICAL MATTER, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY GOT THE MESSAGE THAT AN EXTREME ANTIABORTION POSITIONING AND MESSAGING WAS NOT THE WAY TO GO THIS FALL. DOES THAT MEAN THEY ARE NOT GOING TO TRY TO PASS A MEDICATION WIDE ABORTION BAN IF THEY HAVE CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS COME JANUARY? I DON'T THINK SO. I THINK THERE'S CLEAR SIGNALS THAT HAVE BEEN SENT BY THE PARTY THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT THIS FALL, THAT THAT'S THEIR INTENT. I THINK ONE OF THE THING I WAS GETTING BACK TO THE QUESTION, THE POLITICS OF IT IS THAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THIS ELECTION IS THAT PLACES WHERE ABORTION HAS BEEN MOST SEVERELY THREATENED, IT'S BEEN A VERY POWERFUL DEMOCRATIC MESSAGE, A VERY POWERFUL DEMOCRATIC ISSUE. IN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE HAVE FELT MORE SECURE, IT HAS NOT BEEN AS POWERFUL AND OTHER ISSUES HAVE COME TO THE FORE. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE POLITICS OF THIS LOOK LIKE IF REPUBLICANS DO TAKE CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND POTENTIALLY TAKE CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE, EVEN WITH THE VERY THIN MAJORITY. IF THEY START TO MOVE QUICKLY NEXT YEAR TO TRAY TO CODIFY THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE COUNTRY WANTS, WHICH IS REALLY IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE POLLING IS SOMETHING LIKE ROE V. WADE BECOME THE NATIONAL LAW OF THE LAND. IF THEY TRY TO CODIFY THE OPPOSITE OF THAT, WHAT THE POLITICS OF THAT LOOK LIKE HEADING INTO THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, IT WILL BE QUITE SOMETHING TO SEE AND, AGAIN, WE'RE IN VERY MUCH UNCHARTED TERRITORY, BUT I CAN IMAGINE THAT ABORTION BECOMES ONE OF THE CENTRAL ISSUES IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, WITHIN BOTH PARTIES AND BETWEEN BOTH PARTIES IN THE GENERAL ELECTION.  MATT DOWD, YOUR THOUGHTS?  I'M GOING TO AGAIN AGREE WITH SOMETHING JOHN SAID, WHICH IS THE KANSAS ELECTION THIS SUMMER AND THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS THAT HAPPENED POST-DOBBS, ALL OF THE POLLS THAT WERE DONE IN THE MADE AFTERMATH OF DOBBS WHEN YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT EVERYBODY WAS INTENT ON IT, NONE OF THE POLLS IN KANSAS AND IN THOSE SPECIAL ELECTIONS CAUGHT THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE PRO-CHOICE VOTERS THAT WERE ENGAGING ON ISSUES. NONE OF THEM. IN KANSAS THE POLL SAID THAT WAS GOING TO BE A DEAD EVEN RACE. IT ENDS UP THE PRO-CHOICE SIDE WINS BY 18 POINTS IN A PRESIDENTIAL LEVEL TURNOUT ELECTION IN KANSAS. THE SAME THING HAPPENED IN THE SPECIAL ELECTIONS. SPECIAL ELECTION IN NEW YORK WHERE A DEMOCRACY WAS SUPPOSED TO LOSE BY 4 ACCORDING TO ALL THE POLLS. HE WINS BY TWO IN THIS WHO MADE THE CHOICE AND DEMOCRACY HIS MAINSTAY OF HIS CAMPAIGN. I THINK THIS IDEA THAT OH, DOBBS WENT AWAY AND NOBODY'S REMEMBERING IT, THAT ARGUMENT IS NOBODY REMEMBERED IT AT THE TIME IT HAPPEN BECAUSE WE HAD ALL THESE ELECTIONS WHICH DIDN'T CATCH THE ENTHUSIASM WAVE THAT BUILT. I WOULD SAY THE PROBLEM WITH MOST IN THE MEDIA, NOT ALL BUT MOST IN THE MEDIA, IS THEY WANT TO LOCK INTO A NARRATIVE AND THEN THEY'RE REALLY HARD TO BREAK, BUT ONCE THEY BREAK OUT OF IT, WE HAD A RED WAVE THEY TALKED ABOUT THIS SPRING, WHICH I DON'T THINK WAS OF TRUE. THEN THEY SAID THERE WAS A BLUE WAVE IN THE SUMMER, WHICH I DON'T THINK IS TRUE. AND THEN THEY SAID A RED WE HAVE -- WAVE CAME IN OCTOBER. THERE'S NO WAVE IN THIS ELECTION.  IT'S SETTING UP EXACTLY FOR 2024 TO BE A REFERENDUM ON THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. I AGREE WITH JOHN, REPUBLICANS ARE GOING TO GO AFTER THIS. THEY'RE GOING TO DO WHAT THEY PROMISED TO DO. THEY'RE GOING TO PASS A BILL ON THE FLOOR. BIDEN WOULD BE HAPPY TO VETO IT AND SET UP THE FIGHT, AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT ABORTION FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS.  I'M SO THANKFUL TO ALL OF YOU. CECILE STICKS AROUND. AFTER THE BREAK, A MAD SCRAMBLE FOR THOUSANDS IN PENNSYLVANIA RIGHT NOW. AN 11th HOUR COURT DECISION INVALIDATING TROVE OF MAIL-IN VOTES. THOSE AFFECTED HAVE A CHANCE TO RECOLLECT THE RECORD BUT THEY BETTER HURRY. POLLS CLOSE THIS A MATTER OF HOURS. WE'LL BE BACK WITH THAT STORY IN ONE MOMENT. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. Y IN ONE MOMENT DON'T GO ANYWHERE. 20221108213954.091|20221108214327.236",

        "trs": "> I'M FEELING A LITTLE NERVOUS. THE POLLING DATA SEEMS TO BE KIND OF SPLIT.  THIS COULD BE ONE OF THE LAST TIMES YOU GET TO VOTE IN AN ELECTION THE WAY WE HAVE FOR SO LONG. THERE'S SO MANY CONSPIRACY THEORISTS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO OVERTURN THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. I FIGURE I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP MY LAST OPPORTUNITY.  I'M SO EXCITED TO BE VOTING IN A MIDTERM, YES.  IS IT NORMALLY LIKE THAT?  HEAVENS NO. WE'VE GOT TO DRAG PEOPLE OUT, REMIND THEM TO VOTE. BUT THERE'S AN ENERGY NOW.  THAT'S MY FAVORITE THING TO SEE, VOTERS IN THEIR OWN WORDS. HI AGAIN, EVERYBODY. IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK. ONE HOUR TO GO BEFORE THE FIRST POLLS GO ON THIS MOMENTUM MIDTERM ELECTION DAY, WHERE, AS YOU HEARD THERE FROM VOTERS THEMSELVES, NOTHING SHORT OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AS WE KNOW IT, IS ON THE LINE. KEY BATTLE GROUND STATES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA, AND OHIO WILL DETERMINE WHICH PARTY WILL HAVE CONTROL OF CONGRESS, AND THE ABILITY OF JOE BIDEN TO ENACT HIS AGENDA. MOVING OVER NEARLY EVERY RACE THIS YEAR IS -- THE AREA OF EXTREME DIVISIVENESS AND DISTRUST IN OUR ELECTIONS. TODAY'S RESULTS WILL SHOWCASE THE POWER OF THE LIES AND ON EVERY SINGLE STATE ALMOST, A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE WHO DENIES THE LEGITIMACY OF JOE BIDEN'S VICTORY AND THE RESULTS OH OF THE 2020 ELECTION. THEIR VICTORY ALSO HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR COUNTRY AND HOW FUTURE ELECTIONS ARE RUN IN AMERICA. BY ONE COUNT, SOME 308 OF THE 597 REPUBLICANS RUNNING SELF-IDENTIFY AS ELECTION DENIERS. ONE CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR IN ARIZONA IS NAMED KARI LAKE. EARLIER TODAY, SHE ALREADY SPREAD DISINFORMATION ABOUT AN ISSUE WITH VOTING MACHINES IN MARICOPA COUNTY. WE'LL DIVE MORE INTO WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT STATE LATER IN THE PROGRAM. TODAY IS ALSO THE FIRST FEDERAL ELECTION FOLLOWING THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECISION IN JUNE TO OVERTURN ROE V. WADE. AFTER THAT RULING, ABORTIONS WERE BANNED IN 13 DATES. FOR ONE QUARTER OF THE COUNTRY, THAT NUMBER MAY GROW. FIVE STATES HAVE ABORTION MEASURES ON THE BALLOT. IT'S WHERE WE BEGIN OUR COVERAGE IN GROSS POINT, MICHIGAN. JACOB IS IN HENDERSON, NEVADA, JUST OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS. JACOB, YOU FIRST.  Reporter: WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT GET PEOPLE TO COME OUT. WE TALK ABOUT THE FACTORS THAT GET PEOPLE TO COME OUT. THIS IS THE BEAUTIFUL PART, THIS IS DEMOCRACY IN ACTION. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF WHAT AN HOUR AND A HALF LINE LOOKS LIKE. COME WITH ME. THESE FOLKS HAVE BEEN WAITING HERE. THE COUNTY CLERK HERE TOLD ME HE WAS WORRIED PEOPLE MIGHT STAY AWAY FROM THE POLLS BECAUSE OF ALLEGATIONS OF PROBLEMS WITH THE BALLOTS HERE. THAT WAS DEBUNKED. WELL, AT THIS MALL, PEOPLE ARE SHOWING UP AND VOTING. THIS GENTLEMAN HAS BEEN HERE A LONG TIME. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING FOR?  10, 15 MINUTES.  HOW LONG ARE YOU PREPARED TO WAIT?  AS LONG AS IT TAKES TO VOTE.  GOOD LUCK, DAVE.  Reporter: NICOLE, I WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE HERE. THE LINE SNAKES AROUND THIS ROOM. AND FOLLOW ME OVER HERE. AFTER YOU GET A PEEK HERE, IT AIN'T CHRISTMAS YET, BUT IT IS IN THE MALL HERE IN HENDERSON, NEVADA. ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE EXERCISING THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO VOTE. INSIDE CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA, THESE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WHICH EVER POLLING PLACE THEY WANT. WE HAVE A HIGH AND WIDE SHOT. YOU SEE PEOPLE COMING THROUGH AND VOTING. I'M DOWN HERE IN THE CORNER. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SEE ME BY THE AMERICAN FLAG, BUT I'M WAVING TO YOU DOWN BELOW. EVERY DAY, WE HEAR FROM POLITICIANS, WHY PEOPLE SHOULD TURN OUT. EVERY DAY WE HEAR ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST TO PEOPLE. BUT LIKE I SAID WHEN WE FIRST STARTED TALKING, THIS IS WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD. DEMOCRATS ARE HOPING PEOPLE SHOW UP IN FORCE. THIS IS WHERE LAS VEGAS IS. AND I THINK THEY'RE GETTING WHAT THEY WANT.  I COULD WATCH PICTURES OF PEOPLE VOTING ALL DAY LONG. JACOB, DO YOU HAVE INDICATIONS OR REPORTING THAT TURNOUT IS EVEN ACROSS THE STATE?  Reporter: WASHER COUNTY, THE CONCERN WAS THE WEATHER. AND OUTSIDE THE MALL HERE, THIS IS THE PERFECT PLACE TO VOTE BECAUSE IT'S A BLUSTERY, RAINY DAY. WHERE RENO AND TAHOE IS, THE CONCERN WAS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING OUT, BECAUSE IT'S SNOWING THERE. 19 DEGREES IS THE LOW. BUT IT'S NOT AS BAD AS THEY EXPECTED. IT'S NOT AS BAD AS THEY EXPECT IN VEGAS. THE WOMAN THAT RUNS THIS LOCATION WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED WITH THE TURNOUT HERE. TURNOUT MIGHT BE EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS.  AMAZING. I COULD WATCH THOSE PICTURES ALL DAY LONG.  Reporter: I AIN'T GOING ANYWHERE. I'M STAYING.  YOU'RE ON WITH US ALL NIGHT LONG. YOU WERE ABOUT TO -- YOU WERE AT THAT RALLY IN MICHIGAN WITH GOVERNOR WHITMER, AS WE WERE GOING OFF THE AIR YESTERDAY. JUST TAKE ME THROUGH THE LAST 24 HOURS IN THAT RACE, AND IN MICHIGAN.  Reporter: WELL, THIS HAS BEEN A STATE THAT IS SEEING A LOT OF ACTIVITY. YOU HAVE MICHIGAN STATE OFFICIALS SEEING HIGHER THAN EXPECTED TURNOUT ACROSS THE STATE. POLL WORKERS ARE SAYING THERE MIGHT BE HISTORY MADE FOR VOTER TURNOUT AS IT RELATES TO MIDTERM ELECTIONS. SO VOTERS ARE PAYING ATTENTION. THERE'S A LOT ON THE BALLOT, INCLUDING ABORTION BEING ON THE BALLOT HERE, ALONG WITH FOUR OTHER STATES. IN THIS STATE, THE QUESTION IS PROPOSAL THREE, IT WOULD ENSHRINE ABORTION RIGHTS INTO THE STATE CONSTITUTION. THE GOVERNOR, HER CLOSING ARGUMENT HAS BEEN THAT'S CRITICAL TO DO THAT. ABOX RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS. WOMEN NEED TO HAVE THOSE RIGHTS PROTECTED. SHE ALSO HAS BEEN TALKING TO THE ECONOMY, ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ECONOMIC DECISIONS YOU MAKE IS FAMILY PLANNING. BUT HER REPUBLICAN OPPONENT HAS BEEN SAYING THE OPPOSITE. SHE'S BEEN SAYING ABORTION SHOULD BE BANNED IN ALL CASES INCLUDING RAPE AND INCEST AND MAKING HER CLOSING ARGUMENT ABOUT THE ECONOMY, AS WELL AS PARENTAL RIGHTS AROUND EDUCATION. WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE WITH LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD SIGNS, SO THAT'S A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE. BUT I'M IN GROSS POINT, A DIVERSE PART OF MICHIGAN. THESE ARE PEOPLE FILLING OUT THEIR VOTER INFORMATION CARDS, PEOPLE ARE GIVING US THE THUMBS UP. WE'RE SEEING DEMOCRACY IN ACTION HERE. WALK WITH ME. IF YOU COME IN HERE WITH ME, YOU'LL SEE THERE IS A LINE OF PEOPLE HERE, AGAIN, IN GROSS POINT, MICHIGAN. IT IS TELLING YOU, AGAIN, THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUS HI. OF COURSE, WE TALK A LOT ABOUT THREATS TO DEMOCRACY. AND HERE IN MICHIGAN, YOU HAVE ON THE TOP THREE LEADERS, THE TOP THREE CANDIDATES HERE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, THEY'RE EITHER DENYING THE ELECTION ALL TOGETHER OR QUESTIONING IT. YOU HAVE THE GOVERNOR, THE SECRETARY OF STATE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, AS WELL AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. SO THE DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION HERE, SHE'S BEEN SAYING ALONG WITH ABORTION, YOU NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT DEMOCRACY AND PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY NOT GOOD FOR THE FUTURE OF THE STATE. SO A LOT GOING ON HERE IN MICHIGAN, AND REALLY IN SOME WAYS YOU SEE VOTERS TAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY.  SAME QUESTION I HAD FOR JACOB. WHAT IS THE ANECDOTAL PIECES OF INFORMATION YOU'RE GETTING FROM THE POLL WORKERS THERE, WHO ARE THE OTHER PEOPLE I COULD WATCH ALL DAY. THEY JUST MAKE ME CRY WITH THEIR SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY AND THEIR NEIGHBORS. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING ABOUT WHETHER IT'S BEEN A STEADY STREAM ALL DAY OR WHETHER THEY HAVE ENOUGH BALLOTS. ANY REPORTING ABOUT WHAT TURNOUT HAS BEEN LIKE ALL DAY LONG?  Reporter: SO FAR, STATE ELECTED OFFICIALS, INCLUDING POLL WORKERS, ARE SAYING THINGS HERE ARE GOING VERY SMOOTHLY. THERE IS A STEADY STREAM OF PEOPLE. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMING IN AND OUT, CASTING THEIR BALLOTS. THERE'S A KEY WORD HERE, THAT IS CONTENTION. IN GROSS POINT, IT IS POLITICALLY DIVERSE AND RACIALLY DIVERSE, WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE ARE PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES. WE INTERVIEWED A MOTHER-IN-LAW WHO WAS VOTING FOR WHITMER, BUT HER SON-IN-LAW WAS VOTING FOR TUDOR DIXON. AND THEN WHEN YOU DRIVE AROUND GROSS POINT, I WAS LOOKING AT PEOPLE WITH SIGNS SAYING TUDOR DIXON, AND THEN A NEIGHBOR SAYING WHITMER. A SIGN SAYING TO VOTE YES ON THE PROPOSITION. AND THEN SIGNS SAYING NO, THAT'S THE WRONG DECISION. THAT TELLS YOU HOW PASSIONATE PEOPLE ARE, AND HOW DIFFICULT OUR POLITICS HAS BECOME.  YOU TOO WILL BE JOINING OUR COVERAGE ALL NIGHT LONG. I LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TO BOTH OF YOU, AS WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER TONIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR STARTING US OFF. > JOINING YOU ARE COVERAGE IS THE CHAIR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY. HERE AT THE TABLE, CARE McCASKILL AND DAVID JOLLY. ALL OF YOU ARE MSNBC CONTRIBUTORS. SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS TODAY?  WELL, I'M NERVOUS AS HELL.  ME TOO!  I'VE BEEN GRADING PAPERS AND GIVING BACK MIDTERMS TO MY STUDENTS. LITERALLY JUST FINISHED HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH A STUDENT ABOUT HER WRITING. AND ALL OF THEM HAVE ALREADY VOTED. SO I'M LOOKING AT YOUTH TURNOUT, I'M LOOKING AT BLACK AND BROWN VOTER TURNOUT. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THOSE NUMBERS. BUT I'M PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WISCONSIN AND MICHIGAN, OHIO AND OF COURSE, PENNSYLVANIA. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, I'M NERVOUS AS HELL.  I WORE A VOTE T-SHIRT YESTERDAY. I WISH I HAD ONE THAT SAID I'M NERVOUS AS HELL.  IT JUST FEELS, FIRST OF ALL, THIS FEELS -- IF YOU WATCH \"NFL RED ZONE,\" THIS IS THE WITCHING HOUR. SO ANY FANS OF NFL FOOTBALL, THIS IS THE WITCHING HOUR. IT'S AT A POINT WHERE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE DECIDED SOON, AND IT FEELS LIKE THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO. I REMEMBERED THIS --  YOU CAN STILL VOTE.  EVERYBODY CAN VOTE, BUT AS A CANDIDATE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS THE TIME THAT I FELT LIKE IT WAS A CASE I TRIED AS A PROSECUTOR, AND THE JURY WAS OUT AND YOU JUST HAVE TO WAIT. AND THE WAITING IS SO DIFFICULT WHEN YOU CARE SO DEEPLY ABOUT THE RESULT. SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT LIKE CHRISTMAS, AND A LITTLE BIT LIKE TAX DAY. AND A LITTLE BIT LIKE, YOU KNOW, HAVING TO BREAK UP WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND, AND ALL OF THAT ROLLED INTO ONE. ALL THE ANXIETY AND ALL OF THE WORRY. I DO FEEL PRETTY GOOD. I'VE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE ALL DAY. I'VE BEEN TALKING TO THE NERVE CENTER ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE. THEY'RE TRACKING EVERYTHING AND HAVE DEPLOYED ALL THE RESOURCES AROUND THE COUNTRY. THEY FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT THE TURNOUT IN GEORGIA. INTERESTING THAT REPUBLICANS WERE SHOWING UP VERY EARLY IN TERMS OF IN-PERSON VOTING. BUT THEY CAN'T TELL WITH THE DROP BOXES. AS THE DAY WORE ON, MORE PEOPLE WERE USING SECURE DROP BOXES. THEY'RE ASSUMING IN PLACES LIKE ARIZONA, MOST OF THE DROP BOXES ARE DEMOCRATIC VOTES. SO THEY'RE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT NEVADA, ARIZONA, GEORGIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA. THOSE ARE THE BIG FOUR.  WHAT ABOUT MICHIGAN?  WELL, MICHIGAN --  WHITMER.  LISTEN, SHE'S DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB. AND THAT WILL REALLY BE A TELLING THING, BECAUSE I NOTICED THAT IN THE PREVIOUS HOUR, PEOPLE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION HERE. WE GET SO FOCUSED WHETHER WE CONTROL THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE. GOVERNORS MATTER. REPUBLICANS HAVE HAD A RUN ON A GOVERNOR. ILLINOIS WILL HAVE A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR. MICHIGAN IS GOING TO RE-ELECT A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR. I THINK WISCONSIN WILL HOLD ON. AND WE'LL HAVE A STRONG DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA. THIS IS A BIG DEAL TO GAIN THIS MANY GOVERNOR'S RACES IN THIS KIND OF YEAR WITH INFLATION AND ALL THE INHERENT PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE ARE FACING IN THEIR LIVES. SO THERE'S A LOT TO BE PROUD OF RIGHT NOW. WE'RE COMPETING FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP IN OKLAHOMA, FOR LORD'S SAKE. I MEAN, WHO THOUGHT WE COULD COMPETE FOR A GOVERNORSHIP IN OKLAHOMA. I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT. CAN YOU TELL?  YOU MADE ME EXCITED. I'VE BEEN WEEPING ALL DAY. I VOTED THIS MORNING, I STARTED TO CRY. THEY GIVE ME MY PENCIL. I HAD MY STICKER ON. WHO KNOWS WHO PEOPLE ARE VOTING FOR, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO YOUR POINT, WHEN THE CASE HAS BEEN MADE AND THEY'RE DOING THEIR THING, I WANT TO STILL BELIEVE THAT IS MAJESTIC ENOUGH THAT ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE VOTING TO PROTECT THIS.  THAT'S RIGHT. BUCKLE UP, BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S PARTICIPATION TODAY MEANS THAT AMERICAN POLITICS ARE GOING TO LOOK DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT TOMORROW. I SAY THAT REGARDLESS OF WHO COMES OUT THE WINNER. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. IF DEMOCRATS PULL OFF HOLDING ANY ONE OF THE TWO HOUSES TONIGHT, THEY FLIP GOVERNOR'S MANSIONS IN MARYLAND AND MASSACHUSETTS AS WELL. DEMOCRATS WILL HAVE DEFIED HISTORY. THIS NOTION THAT CLINTON LOST 50 STATES -- OR 50 SEATS IN CONGRESS, OBAMA LOST 60. TRUMP LOST 40. BUSH 43 WAS THE OUTLIER BECAUSE OF 9/11. AMERICAN POLITICS WILL LOOK DIFFERENT TOMORROW. IF DEMOCRATS ARE VICTORIOUS, IT WILL REPRESENT A HUGE SHIFT IN THE AMERICAN POLITICAL GROUND, THAT DEMOCRATS HOLD THE FIRST MIDTERM OF THEIR OWN PRESIDENT. IF REPUBLICANS WIN, AMERICAN POLITICS WILL CHANGE. WE WILL HAVE TO ADJUST TO REPUBLICANS BEING IN CHARGE OF ONE OR TWO OF THE HOUSES OF CONGRESS. BUT THE OTHER THING I'M LOOKING FOR, AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, I REMEMBER IN '18, AS DEMOCRATS WERE WINNING, THEY WERE COMPLAINING AND THEY WERE SAD WHEN THEY WERE WINNING. I'M ALREADY SEEING TODAY PEOPLE WRITING THE POST MORTEMS FOR DEMOCRATS, AND WRITING ALL THIS GARBAGE STUFF.  I HAVEN'T BEEN ON TWITTER ALL DAY.  FRANKLY, PEOPLE AT THESE DESKS ARE SOMETIMES ALREADY SAYING THAT DEMOCRATS DID SOMETHING WRONG. STOP IT! LOOK, THE HISTORIC NORM IS THAT DEMOCRATS WILL LOSE TONIGHT. REPUBLICANS, IF THEY TAKE ONE OR TWO OF THE HOUSES, THEY'RE NOT ENDING SOCIAL SECURITY OR MEDICARE, BECAUSE JOE BIDEN HAS A VETO PEN AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO CHANGE. WHAT REPUBLICANS WILL DO IS GIVE US CULTURE WARS AND IMPEACH THE PRESIDENT. IT'S GOING TO SET UP A VERY IMPORTANT 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CONTRAST, THAT LIKELY WILL STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRAT'S HAND GOING INTO THAT PERHAPS EXISTENTIAL ELECTION.  I JUST REVEALED MYSELF. EDDIE, I WANT TO ASK YOU HOW CONNECTED YOU FEEL LIKE TODAY IS TO THE CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE ANIMATED ALL OF US OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. I MEAN, I THINK IT WAS -- SO WE COVERED THE SPECIAL ELECTION IN GEORGIA. THE ELECTION OF SENATORS RAPHAEL WARNOCK AND OSSOFF. AND WE COVERED THE IMPEACHMENT AND THE INAUGURATION. AND THAT JARRING SORT OF SERIES OF POLITICAL TRAUMAS IS REALLY SORT OF UNEVADED. I WONDER HOW CONNECTED IS THAT IN TERMS OF TURNOUT TODAY AND WHAT IS ON VOTER'S MINDS.  I THINK IT'S INTIMATELY CONNECTED. I THINK AMERICANS REALIZE THAT THIS IS AN EXISTENTIAL ELECTION, THAT OUR WAY OF LIFE IS AT STAKE. AND HOWEVER YOU PARSE THAT, NO MATTER WHERE YOU STAND ON THE IDEALOGICAL SPECTRUM, I THINK PEOPLE ARE FEELING THAT IN THEIR GUTS, IN THE MARROW OF THEIR BONES, THAT SOMETHING MOMENTOUS IS HAPPENING IN THE COUNTRY. AND JUST TO ECHO DAVID, I THINK THERE'S ANOTHER FEATURE TO THIS. IF THE REPUBLICANS LOSE, WE HAVE TO BUCKLE UP, BECAUSE THERE'S THE QUESTION OF THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ELECTIONS. SO THIS ELECTION MATTERS. IT MATTERS IF THE DEMOCRATS WIN, IT MATTERS THAT THE REPUBLICANS WIN, IT MATTERS IF THE REPUBLICANS LOSE. IN OTHER WORDS, THE MIDTERMS AREN'T GOING TO SETTLE OUR PROBLEMS, IT WILL CERTAINLY SUGGEST WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE AS MAD AS WE THINK WE ARE. OR IF WE'RE BETTER THAN WE THINK WE ARE. SO PART OF WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THE STAKES ARE HIGH, AND I THINK AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FEEL THAT, ESPECIALLY IN PLACES LIKE GEORGIA.  YEAH. CLAIRE, WE WERE ON TOGETHER LAST NIGHT WHEN CHRIS HAYES SAID SOMETHING -- ASYMMETRY IS THAT IF THE REPUBLICANS WIN, THERE WAS NO FRAUD. IF THE DEMOCRATS WIN, SOMEHOW IT WASN'T FAIR. THAT'S NORMAL NOW. I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT YOU TEACH YOUR CHILDREN --  IT'S NOT NORMAL.  BUT THAT'S NORMAL FOR THEM. JUST LOOK AT 2020. NONE OF THE REPUBLICANS SAID THERE WAS FRAUD IN THEIR ELECTION. THE ONLY PLACE THERE WAS FRAUD IS WHERE THEY LOST. OUR SYSTEMS ARE SO SAFE AND SECURE. THERE IS SO MUCH REDUNDANCY. I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM SOMEBODY WHO WAS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT POLITICS. THEY VOTED. THEY MADE A CRITICAL ERROR WHEN THEY VOTED. THEY CAUGHT IT. THEY CALLED THEM. THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO FIX IT AND CURE IT. SO THERE ARE SO MANY -- THESE PEOPLE ARE WELL TRAINED. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER HAVE? THEY'LL NEVER HAVE EVIDENCE AND THE FACTS OF FRAUD. BECAUSE WE DON'T DO FRAUD IN AMERICA. WE REALLY DON'T.  NEITHER PARTY.  BY EITHER PARTY.  THEY LOOKED AT IT IN 2000, 60 JUDGES LOOKED AT IT IN 2020. THERE IS NOT SYSTEMIC VOTER FRAUD IN AMERICA.  MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ARE GOING TO WAKE UP TOMORROW BEING NEWLY REPRESENTED BY AN ELECTION DENIER. WE KNOW THE OUTCOME OF OUR LOCAL CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, AND IT'S AN ELECTION DENIER. WE KNOW IN CENTRAL FROM THERE IS A CANDIDATE WHO REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE VALIDITY OF 9/11 AND LANDING ON THE MOON. AND THEY WILL LIKELY WIN A SCHOOL BOARD SEAT. THESE WILL BE OUR NEW REPRESENTATIVES. LOOK, I DID SOME SOUL SEARCHING ON THIS THINKING WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO CALL OUT ELECTION DENIERS? LOOK, WE ELECT STUPID PEOPLE ALL THE TIME. SIT JUST IGNORANCE? IT'S DANGEROUS. IF YOU TELL VOTERS THAT THEIR VOTE IN 2020 DIDN'T COUNT BECAUSE THERE WAS FRAUD AND IT WAS RIGGED, WELL, THAT VOTER NOW DOESN'T FEEL LIKE EXERCISING THEIR VOTE IN '22 OR '24 CAN REMEDY THAT FRAUD. THE ONLY WAY TO REMEDY THAT FRAUD IS THROUGH VIOLENCE AND VOTER INTIMIDATION AND SUPPRESSION, AND THAT IS THE DANGERS THAT LEADS TO EXISTENTIAL QUESTIONS ABOUT DEMOCRACY. SO DENYING THE VALIDITY OF THE ELECTION IS STUPID, IGNORANT, AND DANGEROUS. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO HIGHLIGHT IT.  IT'S ALSO NOT AN END POINT. TO CLAIRE'S POINT, THEY KNOW THAT JIM JORDAN WAS ON THE SAME BALLOT AS TRUMP. EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS IS ON THE BALLOT EVERY TIME. SO EVERY REPUBLICAN THAT WENT BACK IS ALLEGING THAT ON THE LINE FOR PRESIDENT, THAT WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT -- EVERY LINE THAT HAD THEIR NAME ON IT WAS GOOD. IT'S NONSENSICAL.  THEY'RE ARGUING THAT THERE IS NO WAY THAT REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE TICKET SPLIT AND NOT VOTED FOR DONALD TRUMP. SO THEY'RE SUGGESTING THAT ADMINISTRATORS ELIMINATED DONALD TRUMP VOTES. DONALD TRUMP LOST IN 2020 BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HIM. THERE WERE ENOUGH REPUBLICANS WHO SAID I CAN'T STAND THAT GUY, AND I DON'T WANT HIM TO REMAIN PRESIDENT. SO THEY EITHER SKIPPED OR VOTED FOR JOE BIDEN. THAT'S WHY THERE WAS THE TICKET SPLITTING. WHAT REPUBLICANS WILL TELL YOU IS IT WAS FRAUD. IF HE LAUNCHES A NEW RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, HE'S GOING TO RUB ON THIS, AND IT IS DANGEROUS. LOOK, I DON'T WANT TO SAY NOTHING MATTERS TONIGHT. WE WILL SURVIVE TONIGHT. OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE A CERTAIN ELASTICITY TO THEM. WE WILL SURVIVE WHATEVER CHANGES COME OR GO IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS.  THE SUN WILL RISE TOMORROW.  IT WILL SET UP A PRETEXT FOR A VERY DANGEROUS EXISTENTIAL ELECTION IN 2024. IF YOU HAVE A KARI LAKE WHO SAYS I'M NOT GOING TO CERTIFY ELECTORS, IF THE SECRETARY OF STATE IN NEVADA SAYS I'M NOT GOING TO CERTIFY LECTORS.  OR THE ARGUMENT OBAMA MADE, YEAH. ALL SO TRUE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE MAKING ME FEEL CALMER OR MORE NERVOUS AS HELL. WHEN WE COME BACK, WE HAVE BEEN COVERING THE GROWING SPECTOR OF VOTER INTIMIDATION ON THIS PROGRAM FOR WEEKS NOW. THOUSAND THAT ELECTION DAY IS HERE, WHAT WE'RE SEEING AROUND THE COUNTRY AS VOTERS GO TO THE POLLS AND WHAT WE NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT AS VOTES ARE COUNTED. THAT STORY IS NEXT. > PLUS, WE'LL HEAR FROM A CONGRESSMAN FROM ARIZONA ON HOW DEMOCRATS THERE ARE WORKING TO DEFEAT THE FOLKS THAT DAVID JOLLY IS TALKING ABOUT, ELECTION DEFYING REPUBLICANS IN A STATE THAT'S GROUND ZERO FOR THE EX-PRESIDENT'S BIG LIE. AND COMING UP, THE BIG SHOW, RACHEL MADDOW JOINS ME AND STEVE KORNACKI. WE'LL KICK OFF OUR ELECTION COVERAGE AS THE RESULTS BEGIN TO COME IN. THIS SPECIAL EDITION OF \"DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE\" CONTINUES AFTER A QUICK BREAK. CONTINUES AFTER A QUICBRK EAK. 20221108222346.486|20221108222713.794",

        "trs": "> SO OF COURSE, TODAY WE'RE MONITORING POLLING PLACES FOR INSTANCES OF POTENTIALLY ILLEGAL VOTER INTIMIDATION, AFTER WEEKS OF INCREASING REPORTS OF CAMO CLAD PEOPLE FILMING PEOPLE DROPPING OFF BALLOTS IN DROP BOXES. \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTED THIS TODAY -- EVEN REPUBLICAN ELECTION OFFICIALS SAID THEY WERE EMBRACED FOR A RENEWED ONSLAUGHT. I FELT LIKE I HAD BEEN STABBED IN THE BACK REPEATEDLY SO MUCH THAT I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING BUT SCAR TISSUE, SAID A REPUBLICAN ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN MARICOPA COUNTY, ARIZONA. HOME TO PHOENIX. JOIN US NOW IS A FORMER TOP OFFICIAL IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. MARY, I KNOW YOU WORK ON THESE ISSUES. TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING FOR TODAY AND IN THE COMING DAYS?  CERTAINLY TODAY, THIS IS THE CULMINATION, MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF DISINFORMATION THAT IS, YOU KNOW, FUELING VARIOUS ONLINE THREATS AND SO FAR NOT TOO MUCH AT POLLING PLACES, EXCEPT THAT ANY TIME THERE'S SOME LITTLE GLITCH, SOME MINOR MECHANICAL GLITCH OR MINOR HICCUP IN THE PROCESS, THAT'S EXPLODING ONLINE AS BEING PROOF OF SOME SORT OF FRAUD IN THE ELECTION PROCESS AND SOMETHING THAT WILL MEAN THAT A RESULT THAT IS NOT TO THE LIKING OF CERTAIN PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WILL BE BLAMED ON A RIGGED ELECTION. SO WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT, AND, AGAIN, I THINK THINGS HAVE GONE RELATIVELY SMOOTHLY IN TERMS OF VOTER SAFETY AT POLLING PLACES, BUT WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS WHAT WILL COME AFTER TODAY WHEN ANY ONE OF THESE LITTLE GLITCHES BECOMES THE BASIS FOR, YOU KNOW, LITIGATION, BASELESS LITIGATION OVER VOTER FRAUD, POTENTIALLY INTIMIDATION OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CHARGE WITH COUNTING BALLOTS. WE SAW SOME OF THAT IN 2020. WE SAW ATTACKS ON THE BALLOT COUNTING FACILITIES. MANY OF THOSE HAVE PUT UP SECURITY AND REINFORCEMENTS THIS YEAR. BUT THAT -- MINOR LITTLE THINGS WILL FUEL THIS BITTER NARRATIVE OF VOTER FRAUD THAT HAS BEEN, YOU KNOW, RAMPANT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS IN WHICH THE CURRENT PRESIDENT TODAY -- NOT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT, PARDON ME, THE FORMER PRESIDENT TODAY IS DOUBLING DOWN ON. AND SAYING THINGS LIKE, PROTEST, PROTEST, PROTEST IN REFERENCE TO DETROIT, WHICH IS VERY TROUBLING, BECAUSE IT HARKENS BACK SOME OF HIS INVITATIONS FOR PEOPLE TO TAKE MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS, WHICH AS WE KNOW THE LAST TIME HE DID THAT IN A BIG WAY RESULTED IN THE ATTACK ON THE CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6th. WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE THAT, EVEN IF IT'S AT THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS WHERE VOTES WILL BE TABULATED.  MARY, THE PRESS CONFERENCE IN WHICH RUDY GIULIANI'S HAIR DYE APPEARED TO ROLL DOWN HIS FACE WAS LAMPOONED. HE WAS UP THERE WITH THE LAWYERS WHO HAD BEEN SUED FOR DEFAMATION. THEY WERE SAYING ASININE THINGS ABOUT SPACE LASERS, BUT THE COUNTRY HADN'T BEEN PRIMED, IT HADN'T MARINATED IN THE STEW OF LIES FOR AS LONG AS IT HAS NOW. SO IF AN EVENT LIKE THAT SHOULD COME TO PASS NOW, WHAT IS THE ASSESSMENT OF SORT OF OUR HOMELAND SECURITY RISKS AS A COUNTRY?  I THINK, YOU KNOW, WE NOW KNOW WHAT THAT ALL LED TO, RIGHT? AND IT LED TO AN ATTACK ON THE U.S. CAPITOL ON JANUARY 6th. OBVIOUSLY, THIS ELECTION WE'VE JUST BEEN THROUGH IS NOT A PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, SO THE FOCUS IS NOT ON THE U.S. CAPITOL, BUT FOCUS WILL BE IN INDIVIDUAL STATES. I WOULD SAY PARTICULARLY THE SWING STATES. THE ONES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN THE EPICENTERS OF -- EPISODES OF VOTER INTIMIDATION, EVEN AT BALLOT DROP BOXES, ET CETERA. SO NOW, LIKE YOU SAID, YOU USED THE WORD, THAT WAS BEFORE AMERICANS HAD BEEN MARINATING IN THE STEW OF LIES, AND PEOPLE ARE, YOU KNOW, MORE ACCEPTED THESE LIES OVER TWO YEARS. TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE ACCEPTED THESE LIES. TOO MANY POLITICIANS HAVE RUN ON THESE LICE AND HAVE NOT COMMITTED TO RESPECTING THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. IN FACT, HAVE SAID VERY CLEARLY IN SOME CASES THAT THEY WON'T ACCEPT THE RESULTS AND THEY WILL LITIGATE. AND LITIGATION BEFORE BACK IN 2020 WAS ONE OF THE JUSTIFICATIONS AND RATIONALS OF PEOPLE TURNING TO VIOLENCE. I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO OVERBLOWN HERE, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT THERE'S BETTER PREPARATION THIS TIME AROUND FROM THE LAST TIME AROUND FROM OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT, FROM OUR STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS, OUR FEDERAL OFFICIALS. AND HOPEFULLY EVEN FROM, YOU KNOW, HUMAN BEINGS THEMSELVES. ELECTION OFFICIALS AND VOTERS WHO WANT TO SEE A SAFE AND FAIR ELECTION AND TAY WANT TO SEE THE REAL RESULTS. WE HOPE THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE VERY STEELY IN THEIR RESPONSE TO THIS. BUT WE HAVE SEEN VIOLENCE BEFORE AND WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR IT.  MARY, THE TESTIMONY OF RUBY FREEMAN AND OTHERS, I THINK EVERYONE HAD THEM WHERE WE GO TO VOTE, WE ALL HAVE PEOPLE LIKE THAT. THE RISK TO THEM GREW. EVEN BRAD -- GABE STERLING CAME OUT MANY DAYS OF ELECTION DAY, AS HE STARTED TO FEAR THAT THINGS WERE GETTING MORE FRAUGHT. WHAT WILL BE THE INDICATORS IF THAT IS GROWING, IF THE TENSION IS RISING IN THE DAYS AFTER THE ELECTION?  LAST TIME AROUND, THERE WERE MORE REPORTED THREATS THAT WE KNEW SOME OF AT THE TIME, BUT WE HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH MORE ABOUT SINCE THEN THAT CAN BE PHONE CALLS, EMAIL THREATS, THREATS USING ONLINE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. AND WE HAVE REASON TO BE CONCERNED THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE MAY BE A LACK OF CONTENT MODERATION, AT LEAST AT SOME OF THE MAJOR PLATFORMS, ESPECIALLY TWITTER NOW THAT ELON MUSK HAS PROJECTED THAT HE'S GOING TO REALLY REDUCE CONTENT MODERATION, OR AT LEAST WE'RE SEEING THAT SO FAR IN THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THAT HE'S BEEN THE OWNER OF TWITTER. SO THEY CAN ALSO BE THREATS AT PEOPLE'S HOMES. WE SAW THAT AFTER THE 2020 ELECTION. WE'VE SEEN THAT SINCE THEN. WE'VE SEEN, YOU KNOW, PROTESTORS COMING OUTSIDE OF PEOPLE'S HOMES. WE HAVE OCCASIONALLY SEEN PEOPLE FOLLOWING SOMEONE'S CHILDREN, WHETHER IT'S AN ELECTION OFFICIAL. WE SEEN IT WITH SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS FOLLOWING THEIR CHILDREN TO AND FROM SCHOOL, DOING THINGS THAT ARE TERRIFYING. PEOPLE NEED TO KEEP IN MIND, FOR DECADES, HUNDREDS OF YEARS, YOUR POLL WORKERS, THESE ARE YOUR NEIGHBORS, THESE ARE COMMUNITY MEMBERS, PEOPLE YOU KNOW IN MANY CASES, YOU KNOW THEM WELL AND TRUSTED THEM. SO WHY SUDDENLY THEY WOULD BECOME THE BAD GUYS, THE EVIL PEOPLE. I HOPE PEOPLE COME BACK TO FIRST PRINCIPLES ABOUT THE COMMUNITIES THEY LIVE IN AND REALIZE THESE ARE NOT A JOKE. WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR PERSONAL SECURITY OR PULL YOUR KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL OR MOVE, RELOCATE, THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT HAPPENED AFTER 2020. THAT IS VERY, VERY SERIOUS. I THINK OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL BE STAYING ON TOP OF THAT, AS WELL. THAT WILL BE SOME OF THE SIGNS AND OTHER SIGNS WILL BE IF CROWDS START FORMING OUTSIDE OF THE BALLOT COUNTING LOCATIONS, PARTICULARLY ARMED CROWDS. WE HAVE PRIVATE, UNLAWFUL MILITIAS WHO THINK THEY HAVE SOME AUTHORITY TO GO OUT AND EITHER OFFENSIVELY PROTEST AGAINST OR INTERFERE WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS, LIKE WE SAW ON JANUARY 6th. OR SUPPOSEDLY TO PROTECT AGAINST VOTER FRAUD. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY AUTHORITY UNDER STATE CONSTITUTIONS. THEY'RE UNLAWFUL AND VERY, VERY INTIMIDATING AND DANGEROUS IN SITUATIONS LIKE WE COULD BE IN, IF PEOPLE ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK IS GOING TO BE HAPPENING WITH THE COUNTING OF THE VOTES.  MARY, STAY CLOSE TONIGHT. WE'LL CONTINUE TO CHECK IN WITH YOU. THANK YOU FOR SPENDING SOME TIME WITH US TODAY.  THANK YOU. > WE ARE NOW GETTING OUR VERY FIRST EXIT POLLING RESULTS IN THE WAKE OF THE DOBBS DECISION. 60% OF VOTERS ARE DISSATISFIED ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION. 52% OF VOTERS NATIONWIDE TRUST DEMOCRATS MORE THAN REPUBLICANS TO HANDLE THE ISSUE OF ABORTION. THAT MAY NOT BE SURPRISING, BUT IT MAY BE HEARTENING TO A LOT OF DEMOCRATS ABOUT THE PICTURE OF THIS MIDTERM VOTE.  NOT SURPRISING, BUT QUESTION IT'S GOING TO GET ANSWERED TONIGHT, IS IT THE MOTIVATING FACTOR? WILL IT TAKE A PROMINENCE IN TERMS OF THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE ARE VOTING ON? I THINK IT'S VERY SMART FOR THE CANDIDATES THAT LEANED INTO THIS AS AN ISSUE OF FREEDOM. THIS IS ABOUT FREEDOM. WOMEN'S FREEDOM. AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS. AND IT'S -- I THINK IT IS GOING TO CONTINUE. I SAID LAST NIGHT, I THINK IT'S THE FIRST CHAPTER. THERE WILL BE OTHER CHAPTERS ALONG THE WAY ON THIS ISSUE. I'M NOT SURE THE REPUBLICANS KNOW HOW TO HANDLE IT GOING FORWARD. I THINK THEY FIGURED OUT THEY'RE ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC ON THIS ONE.  EDDIE, 62% OF VOTERS VIEW THE SUPREME COURT AS A DEAD WEIGHT AROUND THE REPUBLICANS. VERY UNPOPULAR, THE SUPREME COURT NOW HAS, AS IT STATED INTENTION, TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT MARRIAGE EQUALITY. AND IT OVERTURNED 50 YEARS OF PRECEDENT, THAT AT LEAST HALF OF THE SITTING JUSTICES THAT THEY WOULD RENDER SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS AS USELESS AND FOOLISH.  ON THE ONE HAND, THAT MAY BODE WELL FOR THIS POLITICAL SEASON. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT'S ANOTHER INDICATION OF THE DEEP CRISIS WE FACE. YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A GERRYMANDERED HOUSE, A DYSFUNCTIONAL SENATE, THE IMPERIAL EXECUTIVE BRANCH. AND NOW THE SUPREME COURT, THE LEGITIMACY THAT OUR DEMOCRACY FACES. SO WE UNDERSTAND THE POLITICS OF TODAY. THAT DATA IS WORRISOME IN TERMS OF THE OVERALL FATE AND TRUST IN OUR INSTITUTIONS AS A DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC.  I'M THINKING OF THE SPEECHES THE JUSTICES HAVE GIVEN. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR SAYING WHEN YOU HAVE REPUBLICAN MEMBERS OF A STATE LEGISLATURE SAYING NOW WE OVERTURN ROE V. WADE BECAUSE WE HAVE THE SEATS THAT TRUMP PROMISED US, LET'S GO. 60% OF AMERICANS ARE VERY DISSATISFIED WITH THE SUPREME COURT.  DONALD TRUMP WILL BE REMEMBERED FOR FOMENTING VIOLENCE ON JANUARY 6th. BUT THE SAME LEGACY HE WILL HAVE AS A REPUBLICAN IS THE RESHAPING OF THE SUPREME COURT FOR A GENERATION. WHICH IS WHY VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE, VOTE. IF THIS IS THE ISSUE, A DEMOCRATIC SENATE IS THE REMEDY FOR THAT. IT WILL TAKE TIME. BUT, AGAIN, GOING BACK TO MY EARLIER COMMENTS, YOU CANNOT ENTER TOMORROW REGARDLESS OF HOW TONIGHT GOES. IT'S A COMPETITIVE FORCE ON BEHALF OF DEMOCRACY TO COUNTER WHAT REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO PUT IN PLACE.  AND TO COUNTER THAT MIDTERM HISTORY. I SAY THIS IN MY HOUSE A LOT, THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO, FOLKS. WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK. WHEN WE COME BACK, CLAIRE IS TAKING OVER. I HAVE TO MAKE MY WAY DOWN TO THE THIRD FLOOR. IT INVOLVES A QUICK, WELL, A BATHROOM BREAK, A MIC CHANGE, ALL THAT STUFF. BUT CLAIRE HAS THE HELM, AND SHE'S GOT THIS. DAVID IS STICKING AROUND, SO IS EDDIE. I'LL JOIN RACHEL, JOY, STEVE, THE WHOLE TEAM DOWNSTAIRS IN 20 MINUTES AND 30 SECOND AS THE RESULTS COME IN. SO BUCKLE IN. GET SOME DINNER, LET YOUR KIDS EAT ON THE COUCH. WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. H THIS DON'T GO ANYWHERE. 20221108224002.979|20221108224341.614",

        "trs": "> WE'RE WATCHING TWO SWING STATES OUT WEST WITH ELECTION DENIERS AND CONSPIRACY THEORISTS, WITH KEY SPOTS ON REPUBLICAN TICKETS. LET'S GET TO NBC'S VAUGHN HILLYARD IN PARADISE VALLEY. VAUGHN, FIRST YOU, KARI LAKE IS ALREADY CASTING DOUBT IF SHE WILL ACCEPT THE ELECTION RESULTS AGAINST KATIE HOBBS. TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT.  LAST NIGHT AT HER FINAL CAMPAIGN RALLY, SHE SAID THE PRESS WOULD RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT STOLEN ELECTIONS, REFERRING BACK TO 2020, A RACE IN WHICH SHE IS CALLING THE DECERTIFICATION OF AND THE COURTS WOULD TAKE ISSUE WITH THIS PROCESS IF A REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE NEXT YEAR, IF GOVERNOR KARI LAKE WERE TO GET SUCH A BILL ON HER DESK AND DECERTIFY THE 2020 ELECTION. THE COURTS WOULD TAKE UP SUCH AN EFFORT HERE. AND LAST NIGHT, SHE WAS CALLING IN HER OWN RACE FOR GOVERNOR HERE. THE POLLS SHOW THIS TO BE A NECK AND NECK RACE. THERE'S NO ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD. THERE'S NO ALLEGATIONS OF RIGGING THIS ELECTION. YET, THIS IS A CORNERSTONE OF KARI LAKE'S CANDIDACY AND WHY SHE CURRIED FAVORITE WITH DONALD TRUMP IN 2021. IT'S NOT JUST HER IN THE BALL GAME HERE. IT TAKES THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO CERTIFY THE PRESIDENTIAL RESULTS HERE. AND SHE IS WORKING WITH ELECTION DENIERS FOR THOSE SEATS RESPECTIVELY IN TRYING TO BOOST THEIR CANDIDACIES. OF COURSE, BLAKE MASTERS TOLD ME HIMSELF, IF HE HAD BEEN IN THE U.S. SENATE ON JANUARY 6th OF 2021, HE WOULD HAVE OBJECTED TO THE CERTIFICATION OF JOE BIDEN'S WIN. AND THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE A SLATE OF THESE FOUR CANDIDATES, A QUARTET, IF YOU MAY, THAT HAVE BEEN TRAVELING AROUND THE STATE HERE. AND THEY ARE TRYING TO BOOST THE RURAL TURNOUT, ANDREA, THE TYPE OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS THAT CAME OUT TO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP IN 2020 AND ALLOWED HIM TO NEARLY OVERCOME THE DEFICIT HE FACED IN THE SUBURBS OF THE GREATER PHOENIX AREA. VAUGHN, THANK YOU OUT THERE. JOHN RALSTON, IT COULD TAKE DAYS IN NEVADA, WITH THE UNION THAT IS HOPING THAT THE VOTERS IN LARGE NUMBERS COULD PUSH DEMOCRATIC SENATOR KATHERINE CORTEZ MASTRO. DO YOU THINK SHE CAN WIN OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE LONG HELD ON THE STATE?  I DID PREDICT SHE IS GOING TO WIN FOR A VARIETY OF THE CANDIDATES IN THE STATE. YOU MENTIONED A CULINARY UNION. THEY WERE OUT ON THE STREETS AT 6:00 IN THE MORNING TO START DRIVING PEOPLE TO THE POLLS. THE EARLY VOTE, THAT IS ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF THE VOTE, MAY BE A LITTLE MORE. IT SHOWED A CLOSE RACE BETWEEN THE REPUBLICANS AND THE DEMOCRATS. THE DEMOCRATS GENERALLY BUILD UP A BIG LEAD IN CLARK COUNTY. CAN THE CULINARY UNION HELP CORTEZ MASTO TODAY?  THANK YOU VERY MUCH. > JOINING US NOW IS COOK POLITICAL REPORT SENIOR EDITOR DAVID WASSERMAN. YOU'RE THE GURU OF THE HOUSE SEATS. HAVE YOU SEEN ENOUGH?  WHAT TODAY COMES BACK TO IS DEMOCRATS NEVER STARTED OUT WITH A MANDATE TO BEGIN WITH. AND IN 2020, JOE BIDEN TOOK ON A HISTORICALLY UNPOPULAR PRESIDENT. TRUMP HAD A 53% DISAPPROVAL RATING. AND YET, JOE BIDEN ONLY CARRIED WISCONSIN, ARIZONA, GEORGIA, NEVADA AND PENNSYLVANIA, BY LESS THAN 2.5%. HE WON THE MEDIAN HOUSE DISTRICT, BY 2.1%. AND NOW, PRESIDENT BIDEN IS THE ONE WITH A 53% DISAPPROVAL RATING. THE LAWS OF POLITICAL GRAVITY ARE WORKING IN REPUBLICANS' FAVOR. THE LIKELIEST OUTCOME, IS THAT REPUBLICANS PICK UP HOUSE SEATS. AND DEMOCRATS ARE HANGING ON FOR DEAR LIFE IN THE SENATE. THERE'S A CHANCE THAT DEMOCRATS HOLD PENNSYLVANIA AND WON IN NEVADA, ARIZONA AND GEORGIA TODAY.  LET'S TALK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE SENATE. WHERE DO YOU SEE DEMOCRATS HAVING THE BEST SHOT TO HOLD ON?  I THINK THE ROOT IS STILL IN ARIZONA AND GEORGIA, AND PENNSYLVANIA. THEY GOT TO HOLD ON TO THREE OF THE FOUR CORE STATES, NEVADA BEING THE FOURTH. I THINK NEVADA IS THE LIKELIEST TO GO REPUBLICAN OUT OF THAT BUNCH. BUT PENNSYLVANIA, YOU KNOW, HAS TAKEN A TURN TOWARDS DR. OZ. HE HAS MADE THE RACE MUCH LESS ABOUT -- MUCH LESS ABOUT HIMSELF AND MORE ABOUT JOHN FETTERMAN IN THE PAST MONTH AND REBRANDED HIMSELF AS A MODERATE IN THE SUBURBS OF PENNSYLVANIA. THAT'S PAID DIVIDENDS.  WHAT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT JOSH SHAPIRO, WHO IS RUNNING A STRONG GUBERNATORIAL RACE AGAINST A REALLY EXTREME REPUBLICAN ELECTION DENIER, JANUARY 6th PROTESTER, ALL THE REST, JOINED THE INSURRECTION FOR THE MOB AND THE ANTI-SEMITIC EXTREME LANGUAGE THAT HAS COME FROM DOUG MASTRIANO. HOW ABOUT SHAPIRO THAT COULD PULL FETTERMAN THROUGH IF THERE AREN'T TOO MANY TICKET SPLITTERS.  THERE WILL BE TICKET SPLITTERS IN THE SUBURBS. AND JOSH SHAPIRO HAS SHOWN A TEXTBOOK EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU DO CONFRONT AN ELECTION DENIER. AND KATIE HOBBS HAS SHOWN WHAT NOT TO DO, SHYING AWAY FROM CON FRONTING KARI LAKE. LOOK, EARLY ON ELECTION NIGHT, I THINK WE'LL GET SOME IMPORTANT TEA LEAVES IN VIRGINIA, WHERE WE HAVE TWO HIGHLY COMPETITIVE HOUSE RACES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, IN THE FIRST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, AND IN INDIANA'S FIRST DISTRICT. WHAT I'M GOING TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO EARLY ON, ON ELECTION NIGHT, IS WHETHER REPUBLICANS ARE HEADED FOR A TRUE MAJORITY OR JUST A MARJORIE. I WAS TALKING TO KEVIN McCARTHY. HE WANTS MORE THAN 25 SEATS. ANYTHING LESS THAN 15 AND HE WILL HAVE A HARD TIME CIRCUMVENTING THE FAR RIGHT FRINGE OF HIS CONFERENCE.  DAVID WASSERMAN, THANK YOU SO MUCH. > THE SENATE RACES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND NORTH CAROLINA HAVE NOT GOTTEN AS MUCH NATIONAL ATTENTION, BUT THEY ARE CRITICAL FOR THE FIGHT FOR THE SENATE, IN THE GRANITE STATE, WHERE WE STARTED THE SHOW OFF TODAY, BACK WITH STEVE KORNACKI AT THE BOARD. MAGGIE HASSAN, AGAINST DON BOLDUC. AND THE SENATE SEAT IN NORTH CAROLINA IS UP FOR GRABS WITH THE FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE, CHERI BEASLEY AND TED BUDD FACING OFF. NOW IS NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT, KRISTEN DAHLGREN IN BEDFORD, NEW HAMPSHIRE. KRISTEN, FIRST TO YOU, YOU HAVE BEEN SPEAKING TO VOTERS AS THEY CAST THEIR VOTE. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, THAT IS CRITICAL, NOT JUST -- IT IS CRITICAL FOR THE SENATE. BUT ALSO FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN 2024, TO HAVE A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR IS A BIG PLUS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.  RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY, ANDREA. WE'VE SEEN A STEADY STREAM OF VOTERS AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO PRIMARY ISSUES, THE PEOPLE WE'VE BEEN SPEAKING WITH. REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND INFLATION. THIS IS A STATE GOING INTO A LONG, COLD WINTER. THE COST OF HEATING COULD BE DRIVING RECORD TURNOUT THIS YEAR. WANT TO GET YOU SOME OF THE NUMBERS FROM BEDFORD. SO FAR WE'VE SEEN 4,700 PEOPLE VOTING TODAY. ABSENTEE BALLOTS, COUNTING ABOUT 1,700 OF THOSE, OUT OF THE 16,000 PEOPLE THAT ARE REGISTERED HERE IN THIS DISTRICT. AND THE PARTY BREAKDOWNS ARE INTERESTING. ABOUT 6,000 REGISTERED REPUBLICANS, 4,200 REGISTERED DEMOCRATS AND 5,8 UNDECLARED. GENERAL BOLDUC CALLED THEM PRICKLY INDEPENDENTS. IT COULD COME DOWN TO THOSE VOTERS, THE INDEPENDENTS, UNDECIDED TODAY, IN AGAIN WHAT COULD BE RECORD TURNOUT FOR THIS KEY SENATE RACE HERE. BACK TO YOU, ANDREA.  KRISTEN DAHLGREN, IN BEDFORD. ANTONIO HILTON, YOU'RE IN ONE OF THE TRUE SWING DISTRICTS IN NORTH CAROLINA. WHAT IS THE MESSAGE FROM CHERI BEASLEY AND BUDD?  THIS IS A COMMUNITY WITH REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND UNAFFILIATED VOTERS. MANY ARE PLANNING TO VOTE SPLIT TICKET. THEY DON'T HAVE AFFINITY FOR EITHER PARTY RIGHT NOW. CHERI BEASLEY, THE DEMOCRATS CLOSING MESSAGE, SHE IS GOING TO BE AN INDEPENDENT DEMOCRAT. SHE BREAKS WITH THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND IS FOR LOWERING COST AND MANAGING INFLATION AND FIGHTING FOR ABORTION RIGHTS AND TRYING TO CODIFY ROW ROE. AND FOR TED BUDD, YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR HIM IF YOU WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. YOU WANT A CHANGE. HE HAS REALLY TAKEN THE ECONOMY AND INFLATION TO CONNECT WITH VOTERS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE COST OF LIVING RIGHT NOW. WILY NICHOL, THE DEMOCRAT WHO IS RUNNING IN THE TIGHT CONGRESSIONAL RACE, IS HERE SHAKING HANDS AND TALKING TO VOTERS. IN THIS AREA OF THE STATE, PEOPLE ARE REALLY LOOKING FOR THE VOTERS WHO MIGHT BE CROSSING LINES, WHO ARE GOING TO THINK ABOUT THIS VERY BIG PICTURE, WHO ARE GOING TO BE MUCH MORE ISSUES-FOCUSED, THAN PARTY-FOCUSED. THIS DISTRICT, THE 13th, IS A BELLWETHER ONE TO KEEP AN EYE ON TONIGHT. THE MESSAGE THEY SEND IS LIKELY GOING TO BE REFLECTIVE OF A MESSAGE SENT TO THE COUNTRY TONIGHT.  THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO BE CHECKING BACK WITH BOTH OF YOU TONIGHT. THANKS SO MUCH, KRISTEN DAHLGREN AND ANTONIA HILTON. JOINING US NOW IS A FORMER TOP AIDE TO PRESIDENT BIDEN AT THE WHITE HOUSE, WHO SERVED AS CHAIRMAN OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS. DID THE PARTY MAKE A MISTAKE BY HELPING DON BOLDUC WIN THE PRIMARY BY TAKING DOWN HIS OPPONENT WITH A LOT OF NEGATIVE ADS?  I'M NOT NECESSARILY SURE EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE PREFERRING TO. THEY RAN GENERAL ELECTION COMMERCIAL LES BEFORE THE PRIMARY. THEY DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING POSITIVE ABOUT HIM, BUT THEY POINTED OUT HOW EXTREME HE IS FOR NEW HAMPSHIRE. UNFORTUNATE THAT'S WHERE SO MANY REPUBLICANS IN THE PRIMARY GO TO. THIS IS NOT UNUSUAL TO HAVE TIGHT RACES IN A PRIMARY. THE HISTORY OVER THE LAST 100 YEARS OF PRESIDENTS COMING OFF -- ON THEIR FIRST MIDTERM, IT'S TOUGH. YOU KNOW WHAT? WE'RE RIGHT IN THE FIGHT. WE'RE VERY OPTIMISTIC. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THE SENATE WHEN WE SHOULD HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT REPUBLICANS TAKING FIVE TO SEVEN SEATS RIGHT NOW. WE'RE STILL IN A POSITION TO HOLD THE SENATE.  WHAT ABOUT NORTH CAROLINA? WHEN YOU'VE GOT FORMER STATE SUPREME COURT CHERI BEASLEY, SEEMS TO CHECK ALL OF THE BOXES THAT THE DNC WANT IN A CANDIDATE. SHE WAS THE FOCUS OF DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT EARLY ON. DO YOU --  SHE DIDN'T GET -- SHE DID GET DEMOCRATIC SUPPORT. AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO IS USUALLY IN MIDTERM ELECTIONS, THE DNC SUPPORTS TO THE TUNE OF $30 MILLION. WE'VE GIVEN THE DNC AND ALL OF THE AFFILIATE ORGANIZATIONS $90 MILLION. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A 300% INCREASE IN INVESTING IN DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ALL ARNOLD THE COUNTRY. NOT TO MENTION FUND-RAISING AND ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS HE'S DID. BEASLEY IS AN INCREDIBLE CANDIDATE AND WE EXPECT TO WIN.  THERE'S A LOT OF COMMENTARY THAT THE MONEY CAME IN TOO LITTLE AND TOO LATE FOR HER AND SHE HAD TO REALLY FIGHT AN UPHILL RACE THERE, ONE THAT SHE DIDN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO FIGHT BECAUSE SHE WAS A TAILOR-MADE CANDIDATE. LET'S GO ON TO THE BIG PICTURE, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOLDING ON TO THE SENATE. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN GEORGIA?  IN GEORGIA, WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT CANDIDATE IN REVEREND RAFAEL WARNOCK. HE IS TALKING ABOUT HIS ACCOMPLISHMENTS, BRINGING DOWN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, GUN REFORM, WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO WITH STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS. THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT DEMOCRATS SHOULD BE OUT THERE TALKING ABOUT. THE FREEDOM OF WOMEN TO CONTROL THEIR OWN BODY. ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE KEY ISSUES ACROSS AMERICA. AND SENATOR WARNOCK IS DOING A GREAT JOB IN HIS CLOSING ARGUMENTS SAYING THAT REPUBLICANS, THE FIRST THING THEY WANT TO DO IS REPEAL THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT, WHICH WOULD INCREASE THE COST OF DRUGS FOR SENIORS, DELETE THE CAP OF INSULIN FOR DIABETICS. INCREASE HEALTH CARE. ALL THOSE THINGS THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO. WE KNOW INFLATION IS REAL AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY PRESIDENT BIDEN AND DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS IN THE SENATORS HAVE BEEN WORKING HOUSEHOLD COSTS WHILE REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING, NOT ONLY ARE WE GOING TO DO A NATIONWIDE BAN ON ABORTION, BUT WE'RE GOING TO UNDO ALL OF THE COST-SAVING MEASURES THAT DEMOCRATS WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT.  DO THOSE POLICY QUESTIONS, NOT PUNCH THROUGH AS MUCH AS THEY SHOULD? YOU COULD ARGUE, AGAINST A CELEBRITY, A FOOTBALL HERO, IN GEORGIA?  HERSCHEL WALKER IS A TERRIBLE CANDIDATE. HIS VALUES ARE OUT OF TOUCH WITH AMERICA, PERIOD. THE FACT THIS RACE IS CLOSE IS HOW EXTREME THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS TURNED AND HOW THEY HAVE FORFEITED THE MORAL COMPASS TO FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP. I THINK REVEREND WARNOCK IS GOING TO WIN. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WAIT UNTIL ALL OF THE VOTES ARE COUNTED. AND I'M VERY CONFIDENT THAT HE'S GOING TO PREVAIL. HE'S BEEN AN EXCELLENT SENATOR. AND IF YOU TAKE A REAL HONEST LOOK AT FORMER FOOTBALL PLAYER HERSCHEL WALKER, IT'S SCARY. YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THE SENATE IS A DELIBERATIVE BODY. YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WELFARE OF THE UNITED STATES AND OUR STANDING AROUND THE WORLD. WE NEED OUR BEST AND OUR BRIGHTEST. AND SENATOR WARNOCK IS CERTAINLY THAT.  FORMER CONGRESSMAN, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS FOR BEING WITH US. > UP NEXT, HOW MISINFORMATION AND DISINFORMATION CAMPAIGNS ARE IMPACTING THE ELECTION. WHAT TO LOOK OUT FOR.

        "trs": "> ON THIS ELECTION DAY, HOUSE SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI, IS BACK IN WASHINGTON AFTER THE BRUTAL ATTACK ON HER HUSBAND. PELOSI ON CNN MONDAY, SAYING THERE IS A LINE FROM JANUARY 6th DIRECTLY TO ATTACK ON HER HUSBAND, PAUL.  PAUL WAS NOT THE TARGET. AND HE'S THE ONE WHO IS PAYING THE PRICE. WE ALL ARE. BUT HE'S THE ONE THAT'S REALLY PAYING THE PRICE. IT REALLY -- IT'S REALLY SAD. IT IS A FLAME THAT WAS FUELED BY MISINFORMATION AND ALL OF THE REST OF THAT, WHICH IS MOST UNFORTUNATE. IT HAS NO PLACE IN OUR DEMOCRACY.  JOINING ME NOW IS BEN COLLINS. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT TODAY COULD BE A FACEOFF WITH DISINFORMATION AND MISINFORMATION. AS NANCY PELOSI POINTS OUT, ACCORDING TO THE SUSPECT HIMSELF.  IF YOU SEE THE PLACES WHERE THAT GUY HUNG OUT. THOSE PEOPLE ARE COMMITTED TO VIOLENCE TODAY. IF YOU SEE THEM TODAY, THEY SAY THE REAL SOLUTION IS THE REVOLUTION. WHILE IN THE HOUSE AND SAID IT TO THE POLICE. THERE'S A SIZABLE CHUNK OF THE ELECTORATE THAT HAVE GIVEN UP ON VOTING. THEY BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE IN NURSING HOMES HAVE HAVING VOTES CHANGED. INCREDIBLE LIES. MOSTLY PUSHED FROM THE PROPAGANDA FILM \"2000 MULES.\" THIS COMES FROM A MUCH LARGER MYTHMAKING APPARATUS. IF IT'S BIG ENOUGH, IT CAN INFLUENCE AN ELECTION AND WE'VE SEEN IT RECENTLY IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.  NBC NEWS IS REPORTING THERE'S ELECTION DENIERS ON THE BALLOT IN 45 STATES. HOW DO YOU THINK THE SPREAD OF THE FALSEHOODS COULD AFFECT TODAY'S ELECTION AND AMERICAS DEMOCRACY? MANY ARE RUNNING FOR SECRETARY OF STATE OR GOVERNOR, WHO WILL DECIDE ON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE IN 2024.  IT COULD HAPPEN IN A BIG WAY. I WANT TO SAY A THANK YOU TO BEN FOR ALL THESE DONE TO SHOW US THIS DIMENSION OF AMERICAN LIFE. THE 1800 VERSION OF NBC DID NOT SOMEONE REPORTING ON DYSTOPIA, BUT WE SURE DO AND IT'S A COMMERCIAL PART OF THIS STORY. THROUGHOUT AMERICAN HISTORY THERE'S BEEN ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS AND HOSTAGE TAKING ATTEMPTS. BOTH COULD HAVE LED TO THE ATTACK ON PAUL PELOSI, THAT WAS FOR NANCY PELOSI A FEW DAYS AGO. BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE INSTANT SOCIAL MEDIA, WHERE PEOPLE CAN GET IN TOUCH WITH EACH OTHER INSTANTLY AND AGGRAVATE EACH OTHER AND COORDINATE AND PLOT IN A WAY THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MOST OF AMERICAN HISTORY. YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT ELECTION DENIERS AND WHAT MAKES TODAY DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER ELECTION DAYS, WHICH IS FOR MOST OF AMERICAN HISTORY, WE HAVE HAD FAITH THAT THE WINNERS WOULD BE INSTALLED IN OFFICE AND THE LOSERS WOULD NOT. AND IF THERE'S AN EXTREMELY RARE CASE OF VOTE FRAUD, AND IT HAS BEEN RARE IN AMERICAN HISTORY, IT WOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND THERE WOULD BE CONSENSUS.  IN THAT EMOTIONAL INTERVIEW, RARE, EMOTIONAL INTERVIEW WITH NANCY PELOSI, ANDERSON COOPER ASKED PELOSI ABOUT HER OWN POLITICAL FUTURE. LET'S LISTEN TO WHAT SHE SAID.  HAVE YOU MADE A DECISION IN YOUR MIND, WHATEVER THAT DECISION MAY BE?  I WOULD HAVE TO SAY MY DECISION WOULD BE AFFECTIVE OF WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST WEEK OR TWO.  WILL YOUR DECISION BE IMPACTED BY THE ATTACK IN ANY WAY?  YES.  HOW DO YOU INTERPRET THAT? ONE WAY IS THAT SHE IS WORRIED ABOUT HER HUSBAND AND SHE WAS THE CAUSE OF IT BECAUSE SHE WAS THE TARGET AND HE WAS THE VICTIM. LATER IN THE INTERVIEW, SHE TALKS ABOUT THE NEED TO FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY AND SHE IS THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD PULL THAT OFF.  I HOPE SHE IS SAYING THIS IS A WOMAN WHO LOVES HER HUSBAND AND IS HEART SICK BY HIS INJURY. AND HE WAS INJURED BY SOMEONE THAT WAS TRYING TO KIDNAP HER OR WORSE. KNOWING HER, PEOPLE SHOULD THINK IF THEY DON'T LIKE WHAT A POLITICAL LEADER IS DOING, THEY SHOULD TRY THIS SORT OF ATTACK. YOU GO THROUGH AMERICAN HISTORY AND THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN. OUR DEMOCRACY SHOULD NOT BE HOSTAGE THAT BEN IS SEEING ON THE INTERNET THAT IS MUTTERING THREATS INTO THE NIGHT.  THANKS TO YOU, MICHAEL. AND I'LL ADD MY THANKS TO BEN BECAUSE YOUR WORK IS EXTRAORDINARY AND INVALUABLE. > AFTER THE OVERTURNING OF ROE V. WADE WHAT ROLE WILL ABORTION RIGHTS PLAY IN TONIGHT'S VOTING? TONIGHT'S VOTE COUNT.

        "trs": "> WITH ABORTION NOW FADING AS A TOP CONCERN IN THE MONTHS SINCE THE DOBBS DECISION CAME DOWN, HAVE DEMOCRATS AND OTHER PRO-CHOICE VOTERS DONE ENOUGH TO KEEP IT TOP OF MIND? FIVE STATES NOW ARE VOTING ON ABORTION BALLOT MEASURES, INCLUDING IN MICHIGAN WHERE THE ISSUE IS FRONT AND CENTER IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE.  GOVERNOR'S DECISION TO SUPPORT ABORTION RIGHTS IS HUGE ON MY MIND, AS A WOMAN, AS A MOM, AS A SISTER, AS A -- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN CHOICES TO MAKE. IT'S OUR BODY, IT'S OUR CHOICE.  WE ARE SUPPORTING TUDOR DIXON BASED ON HER EDUCATION STANCE AND HER FIGHT FOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN AND BABIES IN THIS COUNTRY.  JOINING ME NOW ARE CECILE RICHARDS, CO-CHAIR OF DEMOCRATIC-ALIGNED GROUP AMERICAN BRIDGE AND FORMER PLANNED PARENTHOOD PRESIDENT AND TOM BONYER, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGY AND CEO OF TARGET SMART. SO TOM, YOU SAW A SPIKE IN WOMEN REGISTERING TO VOTE AFTER THAT SUPREME COURT RULING LAST SUMMER, AND IN BATTLEGROUND STATES WHERE WOMEN ACCOUNT FOR A LARGER PORTION OF THE EARLY VOTE. WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE?  WELL, YOU KNOW, LIKE YOU SAID, WE SAW THAT RECORD-SETTING SURGE, THIS UNPRECEDENTED SURGE OF WOMEN REGISTERING VOTING NOT ONLY IN KANSAS BUT IN SPECIAL ELECTIONS WHERE DEMOCRATS WON. NEW YORK 19, ALASKA. THE BIG QUESTION HAS BEEN WILL WE SEE THAT SAME SURGE IN WOMEN TURNING OUT IN THIS ELECTION? AND SO YOU KNOW, AS YOU'VE NOTED, AS YOU'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT, OVER 40 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE VOTED ALREADY IN THOSE STATES YOU'VE JUST SHOWED. WE'RE SEEING A BIGGER GENDER GAP AMONG THE EARLY VOTE THAN WE DID AT THIS SAME POINT IN 2020. SO IT'S AN EARLY SIGN. OF COURSE IT'S ALL DEPENDENT ON WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW TODAY. BUT IT IS AN EARLY SIGN THAT THAT INTENSITY IS CARRYING THROUGH ELECTION DAY.  AND THE INTENSITY, HOW DO WE INTERPRET IT, CECILE? BECAUSE THE ECONOMY, INFLATION OVERTOOK ABORTION AS THE TOP ISSUE. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IS DRIVING SUBURBAN WOMEN, FOR INSTANCE, IN THOSE COLLEGE LAR COUNTIES OUTSIDE OF PHILADELPHIA AND PITTSBURGH?  SURE. WELL, FIRST I WANT TO SAY THANKS TO TOM BECAUSE HE HAS REALLY BEEN KEEPING US UP TO DATE ON EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED IN THE EARLY VOTE AND THIS SURGE OF COURSE THAT WE'VE SEEN OF WOMEN REGISTERING TO VOTE AFTER THE DOBBS DECISION, PARTICULARLY YOUNG WOMEN. WHO ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND OVERWHELMINGLY SUPPORTIVE OF DEMOCRATS. I'M EXACTLY WHERE TOM IS ON THIS. WE ARING SEEING RIGHT NOW ABOUT 58% OF THE -- OF DEMOCRATIC VOTE IS WOMEN. THAT'S CONSISTENT GENDER GAP THAT WE SAW IN THE LAST TWO CYCLES. AND INTERESTING, ANDREA, EVEN THOUGH OF COURSE WE KNOW THAT THE ECONOMY AND INFLATION ARE IMPORTANT MOTIVATING ISSUES. FOR DEMOCRATIC WOMEN VOTERS STILL THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT THEY CITE AS A REASON TO GO VOTE IN THIS ELECTION IS THE ISSUE OF FREEDOM TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ABOUT PREGNANCY. THE DOBBS DECISION AND THE EXTREMISM OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS GOING TO BE A HUGE MOTIVATOR THIS MIDTERM ELECTION. I ALSO THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE A HUGE EFFECT IN THE UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AS WELL. THIS EXTREMISM BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS NOT GOING TO AGE WELL WITH WOMEN VOTERS.  AND TOM, WHAT ABOUT THE ELECTION DENIERS? BECAUSE THEY ARE -- WE WERE TALKING ABOUT WITH MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, THEY ARE ON THE BALLOT IN 45 STATES IN KEY RACES.  YEAH. YOU KNOW, AS CECILE SAID, SHE HIT THE NAIL RIGHT ON THE HEAD, IT'S ABOUT REPUBLICAN EXTREMISM. THE REASON WHY THIS ELECTION IS CLOSE -- REPUBLICANS HISTORICALLY SHOULD BE RUNNING AWAY WITH THIS. WE SHOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AT THIS MOMENT. WE KNOW THE HISTORY OF MIDTERM ELECTIONS. THE REASON WHY IT IS SO CLOSE, AND YOU SEE POLLS AS A SORT OF CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE, SOME POLLS SHOWING DEMOCRATS UP FIVE, SOME SHOWING REPUBLICANS ARE UP FIVE, IT'S BECAUSE OF THAT INTENSITY AND ENGAGEMENT IN THE DEMOCRATIC BASE THAT NO ONE EXPECTED, AND IT'S ALL ABOUT REPUBLICAN EXTREMISM. WHETHER THAT IS THE DOBBS DECISION, WHETHER THAT'S JANUARY 6th, AS YOU SAY, THE ELECTION DENIERS, THAT'S MOTIVATING DEMOCRATIC VOTERS WHO GENERALLY WOULDN'T PARTICIPATE IN THIS MIDTERM ELECTION TO COME OUT AND VOTE.  AND CECILE, LET'S TALK ABOUT JILL BIDEN. SHE HAS BEEN EVERYWHERE CAMPAIGNING RELENTLESSLY TO TRY TO BOOST VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS, ESPECIALLY IN HOUSE SEATS INCLUDING A LOT OF PLACES THAT JOE BIDEN HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO GO.  IT'S -- LOOK, IT'S WONDERFUL TO SEE THE FIRST LADY ON THE TRAIL. SHE IS SUCH A FABULOUS LEADER AND SPOKESPERSON. AND YOU KNOW, IT'S INTERESTING, ANDREA, I WILL SAY, AND I JUST GOT OFF THE ROAD FROM SEVERAL STATES, WOMEN ARE EVERYWHERE AS ALWAYS FUELING THE DEMOCRATIC MACHINE. THEY ARE OUT ON THE DOORS KNOCKING. THEY ARE RUNNING PHONE BANKS. THEY ARE RUNNING TEXT BANKS. SO I FEEL LIKE WHAT I'VE SEEN AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING FROM THESE PHOTOGRAPHS WITH DR. BIDEN IS THAT WOMEN ARE ON FIRE IN THIS ELECTION CYCLE. THEY ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED. THEY'RE TURNING OUT TO VOTE. OF COURSE WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF VOTES TO TURN IN ON ELECTION DAY. BUT I THINK WOMEN ARE GOING TO TELL THE STORY, ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF THESE CLOSE RACES.  WELL, CECILE RICHARDS, TOM BONIER, THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP TODAY. AND THAT DOES IT FOR THIS SPECIAL ELECTION DAY EDITION OF \"ANDREA MITCHELL REPORTS.\" REMEMBER, FOLLOW THE SHOW ONLINE ON FACEBOOK AND ON TWITTER @MITCHELLREPORTS.

        "trs": "> WE'RE SO READY FOR FAIR ELECTIONS, AREN'T WE? AND YET I KNOW, LIKE MANY OF YOU, AND ESPECIALLY ME, I'M WORRIED ABOUT TOMORROW. WHO'S WORRIED ABOUT TOMORROW? AND THESE BASTARDS BACK THERE DON'T WANT US TALKING ABOUT STOLEN ELECTIONS. WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY ATTEMPT TOMORROW BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO SHOW UP LIKE OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT. AND THERE'S NOT A DARN THING THAT KATIE HOBBS CAN SCREW UP TOMORROW TO MAKE OUR WIN ANY LESS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO WIN TOMORROW. WE'RE GOING TO VOTE TOMORROW. AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE ARIZONA BACK.  YEAH, THAT'S INTERESTING. THOSE BASTARDS DON'T WANT US TO TALK ABOUT STOLEN ELECTIONS. GUESS WHAT, I GOT BAD NEWS FOR YOU, KARI. EVEN THE CYBER PUNKS CAME OUT TO YOUR STATE TRYING TO RIG IT. AND THEY COULDN'T DO IT. SO YOU'RE SO SAD THEY STOLE YOUR ELECTION. MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO THE COUNTY COMMISSIONERS IN MARICOPA COUNTY BECAUSE THEY SAID IT WAS ALL BULL SHIT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. REPUBLICANS, KARI, SENATORS THAT RAN IT, THEY SAID IT WAS ALL BULL SHIT, KARI, BUT YOU'RE SO SAD. OH, OH, I MUST PREPARE BECAUSE IF I LOSE TO A WOMAN WHO DIDN'T EVEN DEBATE ME, I BETTER SAY THE ELECTION WAS RIGGED BECAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN I'M A REALLY TERRIBLE FRIGHTENING CANDIDATE. I JUST WONDER, KARI, HOW DOES ONE GO PRESENT HOPE AND CHANGE.  VOTING FOR BARACK OBAMA.  AND BEING A BARACK OBAMA SUPPORTER, HOPE AND CHANGE.  LOVED HIM.  TO BECOMING AN ELECTION DENIER.  AND SHE WAS ONE OF THOSE BASTARDS.  THOSE BASTARDS IN THE BACK. OH, WAIT, THAT I WAS WHEN I WAS A BARACK OBAMA SUPPORTER.  I'M CONFUSED.  HOPE AND CHANGE. IS NOW SO WORRIED THAT SHE MAY LOSE TO A WOMAN WHO DIDN'T EVEN DEBATE HER. WHAT'S HER NAME, KATIE HOBBS. DID SHE EVEN CAMPAIGN, SHE'S SCARED OF HER SHADOW.  SHE HELD EVENTS.  THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE HER TO PENNSYLVANIA LIKE ON FEBRUARY THE 2nd, AND IF KATIE HOBBS DOESN'T SEE HER SHADOW, WHAT DO WE HAVE, ANOTHER SIX WEEKS OF WINTER. I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYBODY MORE AFRAID TO CAMPAIGN THAN KATIE HOBBS. BUT KARI LAKE FEARS THAT SHE MAY LOSE, AND IF SHE LOSES, AS SHE'S PULLED FROM THE STAGE.  SUCH BRUTAL ACTING.  SHE WANTS TO GRAB THE CURTAINS OF DEMOCRACY AND TAKE IT DOWN WITH HER. COULD YOU FEEL HER? SHE WAS SO HURT.  WOW.  DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE REPUBLICAN COUNTY COMMISSIONERS IN MARICOPA COUNTY SAID YOU CAN COUNT THIS AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WOULD LIKE. DO YOU WANT ANOTHER RECOUNT, WE'LL DO ANOTHER RECOUNT. THE SENATE SAYS, YOU WANT ANOTHER RECOUNT, THEY DO, WHAT, THREE, FOUR, FIVE RECOUNTS IN ARIZONA, JOE BIDEN KEEPS WINNING, AND FINALLY SOMEBODY SAYS LET'S CALL THE CYBER PUNKS, AND THOSE NERDS GO OUT, I THINK THERE MAY BE BAMBOO IN THE BALLOTS. LET'S CHECK AND SEE IF CHINA SENT BAMBOO. AND AS WILLIE SAID, THEY WERE GOING TO LICK THE BALLOTS.  YOU GOT TO TASTE THEM.  AND IF THEY GOT A SPLINTER IN THEIR TONGUE FROM THE BAMBOO IN CHINA, THEN IT WAS RIGGED. I GOT TO SAY, I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THAT'S GOOD ACTING IN LOCAL NEWS. I DON'T KNOW.  THAT WAS THE WORST ACTING I'VE EVER SEEN.  IT WASN'T REALLY GOOD.  IT WAS TERRIBLE. IT WAS BRUTAL.  I'VE SEEN A LOT OF TEENAGERS THAT CAN ACT BETTER THAN THAT. AND YET SHE'S TALKING ABOUT, AGAIN, TELLING US RIGHT NOW IF SHE DOESN'T WIN, THEN SHE'S GOING TO TRY TO TAKE DEMOCRACY DOWN WITH HER IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA AND CHALLENGE THE ELECTIONS. THIS IS WHERE WE ARE. THESE QUAINT CONCEPTS OF FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS, PEACEFUL TRANSITIONS, MADISONIAN DEMOCRACY, AND MY GOD, EVEN THE CONSTITUTION ITSELF, THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE, SHE SAYS SHE'S GOING TO SEND ARIZONA SHERIFFS TO THE BORDER TO ARREST FBI AGENTS. YOU DO THAT, KARI. YOU DO THAT. LET'S SEE WHO WINS THAT, RIGHT? LIKE YOU MAY HAVE TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW THE LAW. AND I WILL SAY, WILLIE, WHEN DEMOCRATS SAY WE MUST WIN EVERY ELECTION OR DEMOCRACY IS AT RISK, IT BOTHERS ME. IT BOTHERS ME BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE JUST VOTING THEIR WALLETS. SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE JUST VOTING ABOUT PRICES AT THE GAS STATION. SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE JUST VOTING HIGH GASOLINE PRICES. SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE JUST VOTING FOR THINGS THAT MATTER TO THEM. THEY'RE NOT VOTING ON AN EXISTENTIAL DECISION ON DEMOCRACY. ARIZONA, THOUGH, IS ONE OF THOSE RACES, A HANDFUL OF RACES WHERE THERE IS A LOT ON THE LINE BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMEBODY OPENLY SAYING SHE WILL NOT RESPECT THE WILL OF THE VOTERS. SHE WILL NOT RESPECT MADISONIAN DEMOCRACY IF SHE DOES NOT WIN. THAT IS A DANGER FOR THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA. IT ULTIMATELY BECOMES A DANGER FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IF SHE IS THE GOVERNOR WHEN WE'RE COUNTING VOTES IN 2024, AND THERE MAY BE AN OUTCOME THAT MAYBE KARI DOESN'T LIKE.  AND SHE'S NOT ALONE. THE SECRETARY OF STATE, MARK FINCHEM HAS SAID THE SAME THING. HE SAID I'M NOT GOING TO NECESSARILY RESPECT THE RESULTS OF THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. BLAKE MASTERS FOR THE SENATE, HE WOULD HAVE LESS SAY BUT ON THE STATE LEVEL, YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE SLATE OF ELECTIONS THAT ARE ELECTION DENIERS. THAT'S A DIFFERENT OUTCOME. WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THOSE RECOUNTS, JOE, IN ARIZONA, THE MANY MANY RECOUNTS TURNED UP MORE VOTES FOR JOE BIDEN AFTER MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT, AFTER CONSPIRACY THEORISTS BASE INSTEAD FLORIDA, THE CYBER NINJAS WERE FLOWN IN AND GIVEN ACCESS TO MACHINES AND BALLOTS. MORE VOTES FOR JOE BIDEN WERE FOUND THAN FOR DONALD TRUMP AFTER ALL OF THAT.  AND REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS, MIKE, ONE AFTER ANOTHER IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA WAS LIKE, COME ON, GUYS, COME ON. THIS WAS A FAIR AND FREE ELECTION. WE COUNTED IT UP RIGHT. LIKE, COME ON. MOVE ALONG. MOVE ALONG. AND EVEN, AGAIN, THE CYBER PUNKS, THEY FIND MORE VOTES FOR JOE BIDEN AT THE END, AND YOU STILL HAVE ELECTION DENIERS HERE. AGAIN, PEOPLE WHO JUST, THEY DON'T THINK THE RULES APPLY. TALKING ABOUT GRAVITY APPLYING, THEY DON'T THINK GRAVITY APPLIES ANYMORE. THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN THE RULES OF GRAVITY THAT THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT. THEY CAN FLY ABOVE THE RULES THAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS TO FLY ABOVE. THEY CAN FLOAT ABOVE THE RULES THAT EVERY ELECTED LEADER HAS HAD TO LIVE BY FOR 240 YEARS IN THIS GREAT CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC.  YOU KNOW, WHAT WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE, WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HERE LARGELY FOR THE PAST THREE OR FOUR MINUTES I THINK IS THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT IS SO ALTERED THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WE JUST SAW A PERFORMANCE BY AN ACTRESS, NOT A CANDIDATE, AN ACTRESS.  NOT A GOOD ONE, BUT AN ACTRESS ALL THE SAME.  KARI LAKE, YEAH.  AND SHE'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THE STAGE OF ARIZONA, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LANDSCAPE OF AMERICAN POLITICS, AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT KARI LAKE SAID, AND YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE FINCHEM SAYS, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ACCEPT THE VOTE UNLESS THEY WIN, YOU WONDER WHY IT'S SUCH AN ISSUE OUT THERE WITH PEOPLE, ORDINARY PEOPLE. THEY ARE SICK OF ALL OF THIS. WHY? BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE KARI LAKE AND TOO MANY REPUBLICANS AND ELECTION DENIERS IN THE PAST AND TODAY, THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR SIX STRAIGHT YEARS. THERE HAS BEEN NO LET UP IN THE ASSAULT ON OUR SENSES FROM THE PRESIDENT, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, THE OTHER GUY WHO CONTINUES STILL DOING IT EVERY DAY. HE MAKES THE NEWS EVERY DAY WITH HIS LIES AND HIS HYSTERIA, AND HIS INSULTS AND HIS BACK OF COMMON SENSE, AND LACK OF CIVILITY, EVERY DAY WE PUT HIM ON TV. EVERY DAY FOR SIX YEARS, THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT DOES TO YOUR SENSES.  WELL, IT'S A FASCIST CULT. THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENS. AND EVERYBODY WHO STUDIES FASCISM CAN MARK THE BEGINNING OF THIS TO THIS MOMENT NOW.  IT IS, INDEED, YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT WHAT IT DOES IS IT DEADENS THE SENSES OF THE AVERAGE HUMAN BEING.  OF COURSE. EVERY SHOCKING MOMENT THAT HAS GONE BY, AMERICA HAS BECOME LESS SENSITIZED AND, YOU KNOW WHAT, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE VICTIMS OF THIS CULT. I WILL NOT HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE. I DON'T UNDERSTAND CHRISTIANS, I REALLY DON'T. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENED TO CHRISTIANS.  YOU MEAN CHRISTIAN NATIONALISTS.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND CHRISTIANS WHO ARE OUT THERE, PAUL PELOSI GOT HIT, LET'S MAKE FUN OF HIM. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN DO IT.  I'M JUST FOCUSING, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND CHRISTIAN NATIONALISTS WHO HAVE BECOME ENSNARLED IN THIS CULT.  I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL, HOW THEY CAN USE THE WORD CHRIS TAN. BUT FOR KARI LAKE WHAT'S, I THINK, THE MOST TRIGGERING ABOUT A CANDIDATE LIKE KARI LAKE IS THAT SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S DOING. SHE ABSOLUTELY KNOWS.  THE BARACK OBAMA SUPPORTER.  THAT SHE IS, FOR HER, FOR ANYTHING SHE GAINS, SHE HURTS DEMOCRACY.  AND WHAT'S SO STUNNING, THOUGH, IS TO WATCH DEMOCRATS CEDE TO KARI LAKE WITHOUT A FIGHT. YOU HAVE AN OPPONENT WHO WON'T EVEN DEBATE HER. SO KARI LAKE GETS UP, SHE SPEWS ALL OF THAT JUST ABSOLUTE NONSENSE. WHERE IS HER OPPONENT SAYING THIS IS BULL SHIT AND COMING OUT FORCEFULLY. THIS IS SOMEONE WHO'S CALLING THE MEDIA BASTARDS AND SHE ACCEPTED HER PAYCHECK FROM A MEDIA ENTERPRISE FOR DECADES.  DECADES, HOPE AND CHANGE, BABY. HOPE AND CHANGE.  BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, THOUGH. SO IF WE ARE TO BELIEVE THAT KARI LAKE MAY BE THE GREATEST LOOMING THREAT, TO AMERICAN DEMOCRACY OF ALL THE CANDIDATES THAT ARE ON THE BALLOT THIS YEAR, THEN WHY DO THE DEMOCRATS JUST SIT BACK. WHY DO THEY NOMINATE SOMEBODY WHO'S AFRAID TO DEBATE HER?  AND NOT COUNTER THE MESSAGE BECAUSE IT'S OUT THERE. THERE'S THIS IDEA, OH, DON'T DIGNIFY IT, BUT IF YOU JUST KEEP SILENT, THEN YOU'RE --  EXPOSE IT. EXPOSE IT. LOOK, THE ONLY THING SHE HAD TO DO WAS GETTING ON THAT STAGE WITH KARI LAKE, AND EVERY TIME KARI LAKE OPENED HER MOUTH, YOU TURN, YOU LOOK AT HER, AND YOU GO, AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE UNQUALIFIED TO BE GOVERNOR AND MAKE YOUR POINT. EVERY WORD. THIS IS NOT A HARD DEBATE, JOE, TO HAVE.  AND BY THE WAY, AGAIN, I DON'T HAVE ALL -- LET'S JUST SAY, THAT'S WHY THE FOUR REPUBLICAN COUNTY COMMISSIONERS IN MARICOPA COUNTY SAID WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS A LIE. THAT'S WHY THE STATE SENATOR SAID WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS A LIE. THAT'S WHY THE THREE RECOUNTS PROVE THAT YOU'RE A LIAR. AND JUST GO DOWN THE LIST.  KARI LAKE IS A LIAR.  IF KATIE HOBBS IS AFRAID OF HER SHADOW, THEN JUST WRITE IT DOWN HERE, AND WHEN SHE STARTS LYING, PEOPLE DON'T CARE, JUST READ IT. I'M NOT REALLY GOOD ON TV, BUT I CAN READ, AND SHE JUST READS IT. WHERE HAS SHE BEEN?  FETTERMAN PUTTING HIMSELF OUT THERE.  CONTRAST WITH JOHN FETTERMAN WHO HAS BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH AND IS STILL GIVING IT HIS ALL, IT'S JUST ASTONISHING.  I THINK THE VOTERS RESPOND TO THAT.  THIS IS A MASSIVE DERELICTION OF DUTY, NOT ONLY ON KATIE HOBBS' PART BUT ON THE PART OF ARIZONA DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND ON THE PART OF THE NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY. IF THIS WOMAN WHO'S AFRAID OF HER SHADOW, AND IF DEMOCRATS BELIEVE AS THEY ALL SAY, KARI LAKE POSES A GRAVE RISK TO DEMOCRACY, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT IT, WHICH RAISES A QUESTION, MICHAEL STEELE, WHEN IS THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE GOING TO GET A POLITICAL DIRECTOR IN THERE, BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A POLITICAL DIRECTOR OUTSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. NO, THEY DON'T HAVE ANYBODY INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE. YOU'VE GOT, YOU KNOW, BUSH HAD CARL ROW, CLINTON HAD CARVILLE. HE HAD POLITICAL DIRECTORS. BIDEN, THEY HAVEN'T USED THE BULLY PULPIT EFFECTIVELY. THEY HAVEN'T FOCUSED THEIR MESSAGE EFFECTIVELY. DEMOCRATS MAY HAVE A DETERIORATE -- GREAT NIGHT TONIGHT, THEY MIGHT. WE'RE LOOKING AT KARI LAKE, DO YOU THINK JAMES CARVILLE WOULD HAVE LET THAT FLY.  NO, NO.  JAMES CARVILLE WOULD HAVE GONE OUT HIMSELF, AND SAID I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT WOMAN, BUT WHEN IS THE WHITE HOUSE, LET ME ASK THIS QUESTION, WHEN IS THE WHITE HOUSE GOING TO GET A POLITICAL DIRECTOR THAT FOCUSES THEIR MESSAGE AND HELPS THEM EFFECTIVELY USE THE BULLY PULPIT, WILLIE?  YEAH, MICHAEL.  JOE'S ASKED THE QUESTION.  FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD SAY RON KLAIN IS THE DE FACTO POLITICAL DIRECTOR.  NO, HE'S NOT.  HE'S THE CHIEF OF STAFF.  HE'S THE CHIEF OF STAFF, AND IF YOU CALL TWEETING WHILE YOU'RE CHIEF OF STAFF A POLITICAL DIRECTOR.  I'M NOT DEFENDING IT. I'M JUST SAYING, I THINK THAT'S THE ROLE HE SERVES.  HE AIN'T A POLITICAL DIRECTOR. I'VE SEEN A POLITICAL DIRECTOR AND RON KLAIN AIN'T A POLITICAL DIRECTOR.  AND THAT'S NOT THE JOB OF THE CHIEF OF STAFF. LIKE YOU SAID, THE BUSH WHITE HOUSE HAD KARL ROVE, HE RAN THE POLITICAL OPERATIONS AND MADE THE CONNECTION IN THE MESSAGING AND THE ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE WITH THE RNC. FOR THE DNC, LIKE THE RNC, THE POLITICAL ARM OF THE WHITE HOUSE, SO THEY GET TO DO POLITICALLY THE THINGS THE WHITE HOUSE WANTS TO BE ABOVE AND NOT HAVE THEIR FINGER PRINTS ON. THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE STYLE OR EFFORT ON THIS WHITE HOUSE BEHALF TO GO OUT AND USE THE DNC AS A BATTERING RAM IN A WAY TO PUSH BACK ON CERTAIN NARRATIVES, LIFT UP OTHER NARRATIVES. THEY SPENT THE FIRST 18 MONTHS IN A BATTLE WITH SINEMA AND MANCHIN IN SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T NEED TO FIGHT ABOUT. THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THE UNION SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABOUT THE CALL OF DEMOCRACY IN THE MOMENT, CONNECTING, EUROPE, UKRAINE, TO WHAT'S HAPPENING AT HOME AND WEAVING NARRATIVES AROUND THE ECONOMY, HEALTH CARE INTO THE OVERARCHING STORY OF DEMOCRACY. THOSE WERE MISSED MOMENTS. BUT I GO BACK TO WHAT I SAID IN THE LAST HOUR. IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS, WHAT IS TAKEN IS BARACK OBAMA TO KIND OF PUT THAT UMPH, THAT SPIN, THAT MOMENT IN CLARIFYING, CRYSTAL CLARITY FOR FOLKS. THE WHITE HOUSE IS GOING TO BE THE BENEFICIARY OF THAT IN SOME RESPECTS. I DON'T THINK THE NIGHT IS GOING TO BE AS BAD FOR DEMS AS A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE PROJECTING FOR A HOST OF REASONS THAT I TOUCHED ON BEFORE, THE ELECTORATE IS TELLING US SOMETHING THAT IS NOT BEING CAPTURED IN POLLS RIGHT NOW. IT HAS NOT BEEN CAPTURED IN POLLS FOR A WHILE, AND WHILE A LOT OF FOLKS' EMPHASIS HAS BEEN PLACED ON HOW THAT HAS ANIMATED ITSELF ON THE RIGHT, IT HAS ALSO ANIMATED ITSELF IN THE CENTER AND ON THE LEFT, AND HOW I THINK TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE POLITICAL PART OF IT. HOW THE WHITE HOUSE RESPONDS, IF, IN FACT, THEY'RE SITTING THERE LOOKING AT A REPUBLICAN HOUSE AND A REPUBLICAN SENATE, THEY'RE GOING TO NEED THAT POLITICAL DIRECTOR BECAUSE THE NEXT TWO YEARS ARE GOING TO BE A HELLSCAPE OF UNIMAGINABLE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE COUNTRY BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT GOVERNING ON THE RIGHT. IT IS ABOUT IMPEACHMENT. IT IS ABOUT RETRIBUTION. IT IS ABOUT THE BIDDING OF TRUMP.  REMIND PEOPLE WHAT THE MARGINS ARE. WE PUT UP THE GRAPHICS. ONE NET GAIN FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE. FIVE SEATS TO GAIN IN THE HOUSE, AND REPUBLICANS CONTROL THE HOUSE AS WELL. MIKE, TO GO BACK TO YOUR EARLIER POINT AS WE WATCH KARI LAKE ABOUT THE NUMBNESS IN THE COUNTRY, THERE'S CYNICISM, POLITICAL CYNICISM, WE HAVE SEEN THAT FOR GENERATIONS AND THEN THERE'S MALICE. AND WHAT SHE'S DOING THERE, AND OTHER CANDIDATES DO IS MALICIOUS TO THE DEMOCRACY, WHICH IS TO SAY, SHE KNOWS BETTER, SHE'S A SMART WOMAN, AND SHE'S OKAY GOING OUT SO SHE CAN EARN A JOB AND WIN A JOB TO SAY YOU DON'T HAVE THE HONOR THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR MORE THAN 200 YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY. SHE'S WILLING TO THROW IT OUT ON THE TABLE IN CASE SHE LOSES THE GROUND HAS BEEN SEEDED FOR THAT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS STARTED BUT FINDING ITS WAY INTO RACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, AND NO DOUBT THE DAMAGE IT'S DONE TO THE COUNTRY. THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE OVER THE COURSE OF REALLY SIX YEARS. AND THE OTHER ASPECT OF IT IS WHY? AND I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS. WHY HAVE THE DEMOCRATS BEEN SO WEAK IN THEIR INABILITY TO ATTACK. WHY ARE THEY SO WEAK IN TERMS OF USING COMBATIVE LANGUAGE. LET'S GO TO LIAR LAKE, IT'S POLLUTED. IT'S POLLUTED. STUFF LIKE THAT. BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO HAND-TO-HAND VERBAL COMBAT IT SEEMS. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT IN THE ISSUES OF INFLATION, THE ISSUES OF CRIME, AND SOMETHING WE DON'T TALK ABOUT ENOUGH THAT'S OUT THERE, AN UNDERLYING ISSUE. NONE OF THE DEMOCRATS I HAVE HEARD TALKED ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT SCHOOLS OR LACK OF SCHOOLS HAVE HAD ON FAMILIES FROM COAST TO COAST IN THIS COUNTRY. I HAVEN'T HEARD THEM TALK ABOUT IT.  I WILL SAY IN DEFENSE OF DEMOCRATS, IT'S VERY HARD TO COME BACK AGAINST A FIRE HOSE OF LIES, AND, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE HERE, THEY'RE THERE, THEY CAN SAY ANYTHING AS OPPOSED TO DEMOCRATS.  DO IT. COME BACK.  JOE CAN DO IT.  IT'S VERY SIMPLE. IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHO CAN DO IT, LOOK WHAT BARACK OBAMA DOES. YOU CAN LOOK WHAT, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE SKILLED CANDIDATES. LOOK WHAT JOSH SHAPIRO DOES, TIM RYAN, IT'S JUST NOT HARD. THE THING IS IT'S NOT THE CATASTROPHING, THE TOAST HAS TOO MUCH BUTTER. DEMOCRACY IS FAILING.  STOP IT.  YOU HAVE TO MOCK THEM, AND THAT'S WHY BARACK OBAMA LINES UP SO WELL AGAINST TRUMPISTS IS BECAUSE HE GOES IN THERE, HE GIVES THE -- AND THEN HE KIND OF LAUGHS.  THE HERSCHEL WALKER BID. THE CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT KARI LAKE IS SAYING. BY THE WAY, IT'S FACTS. JUST GET THE FACTS, AND SAY, YOU KNOW, MARICOPA COUNTY, REPUBLICAN COUNTY COMMISSION, THE MARICOPA ELECTION BOARD, YOU KNOW, THE ARIZONA REPUBLICAN SENATE, YOU GO DOWN THE LIST, RIGHT, AND YOU JUST HAVE TO DO IT, AND WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT? FOR ME. THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHO WINS ARIZONA. IT'S NOT ABOUT WHO WINS TONIGHT. THIS IS ABOUT MY FRIENDS. THIS IS ABOUT MY FAMILY. THIS IS ABOUT MY LOVED ONES. THAT THEY'RE HEARING THESE LIES, AND THEY'RE BUYING INTO THESE LIES. WHY? BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE KATIE HOBBS ARE RUNNING. BECAUSE DEMOCRATS AT TIMES, SEEM TO BE AFRAID OF THEIR OWN SHADOW. NEED TO GET THE TRUTH OUT. AND IT'S NOT THAT HARD. WHERE THERE IS WEAKNESS, DEMOCRATS BRING STRENGTH. WHERE THERE ARE LIES, TELL THE TRUTH. IT'S NOT THAT HARD.  SO TWO POINTS ON THAT. THE FIRST, YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT, AND THE NARRATIVE IS NOT A COMPLICATED ONE WHERE YOU'RE JUST SAYING THE FACTS, AND THE FACTS ARE THAT IT'S NOT DEMOCRATS SAYING THAT THE ELECTION WASN'T STOLEN. IT'S REPUBLICAN ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO ARE SAYING THESE ELECTIONS WERE NOT STOLEN. USING THAT AS YOUR SHIELD TO GO INTO THOSE CONVERSATIONS AGAINST ELECTION DENIERS IS ONE WAY TO COMBAT IT. BUT I WILL SAY THIS, HERE WE ARE ON ELECTION DAY. IT IS 7:45 IN THE MORNING.  THAT'S ALL?  FOLKS ARE GOING TO GET UP AND THINK ABOUT VOTING TODAY.  YEAH.  IF YOU'VE HEARD ANYTHING THIS MORNING, THE ONE THING YOU NEED TO TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS YOU NEED TO GET YOUR ASS OUT AND VOTE. OBAMA SAID THAT. REPUBLICANS ARE SAYING THAT. INDEPENDENTS ARE SAYING THAT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU GOT TO GO OUT AND VOTE TO PROVE THE TRUTH OF DEMOCRACY, AND TO DISPROVE THAT DESPITE THE INCOMPETENCY, DESPITE THE INABILITY TO GET THE MESSAGE THAT THE VOTERS GOT THIS BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GET IT NOW, YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT COME NEXT YEAR, BABY, BECAUSE TRUST ME, WHAT'S ABOUT TO HIT YOU, YOU AIN'T GOING TO LIKE. YOU NEED TO GET YOUR BUTT UP. GET YOURSELF TOGETHER.  IT'S TRUE.  AND GO OUT AND VOTE.  AMEN.  AND YOU KNOW HOW YOU NEED TO DO IT. YOU NEED TO VOTE FOR PRO DEMOCRACY CANDIDATES WHO ARE LOOKING YOU IN THE EYE AND TELLING YOU THE LAST ELECTION WASN'T STOLEN, THAT IDIOT OVER THERE IS LYING TO YOU, AND WE'RE GOING TO COME CORRECT ON THIS THING. THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT, JOE.  IT IS, AND YOU DO IT WITH OPTIMISM. LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, THIS MORNING, I'M ACTUALLY OPTIMISTIC. I LOVE ELECTIONS. I LOVE THE FACT THAT MORE AMERICANS ARE VOTING THIS MIDTERM ELECTION THAN ANY OTHER MIDTERM ELECTION IN AMERICAN HISTORY. THAT'S SOMETHING FOR US TO CELEBRATE. I'M REALLY -- I'M HAPPY THAT IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA, NO, I AM, IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA, EVERYONE IS RUNNING AROUND GOING JIM CROW 2.0. WILLIE AND I WERE SAYING AT THE TIME, YEAH, NO, YOU PROBABLY WANT TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT, LIKE, BULL CONNOR. BECAUSE LIKE I UNDERSTAND WE WANT TO GIVE PEOPLE WATER IN A LINE, BUT IT'S NOT QUITE LIKE UNLEASHING GERMAN SHEPHERDS AND FIRE HOSES ON PEOPLE IN THE STREETS, SO THERE'S THIS WAILING AND WEEPING AND GNASHING OF TEETH. THEY MOVE THE ALL STAR GAME FROM ATLANTA BEFORE THEY EVEN READ THE BILL, BEFORE THEY EVEN HEARD DEMOCRATS IN GEORGIA GOING DON'T DO THAT, PLEASE, LET'S KEEP THE ALL STAR GAME HERE, BUT THEY DIDN'T DO IT, SO THE BRAVES GOT PISSED OFF AND WON THE WORLD SERIES. ANYWAY, THE THING IS, LET'S CELEBRATE THE FACT THAT IN GEORGIA, THE NUMBERS JUST OUTRAGEOUSLY JUST OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH. AMERICANS PARTICIPATING IN ELECTIONS HIGHER THIS MIDTERM ELECTION THAN EVER BEFORE. THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE HAPPY AND HOPEFUL ABOUT.  44 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY VOTED BEFORE THE POLLS OPENED TODAY. THAT'S AN ASTOUNDING NUMBER AND IT DWARFS 2018 WHICH WAS ALSO A BIG NUMBER. GO OUT AND VOTE FOR WHOEVER I WANT TO VOTE FOR. I ALWAYS FEEL ON ELECTION DAY, AREN'T WE LUCKY TO LIVE HERE WHERE WE HAVE A SAY IN THE THING BECAUSE WE'VE GROWN UP WITH IT, BUT WE GET A SAY IN IT. WHATEVER YOUR SAY IS, GO HAVE IT. GO MAKE YOUR STATEMENT. YOU GET TO PRESS A BUTTON AND DECIDE WHICH DIRECTION WE'RE HEADED RIGHT NOW.  ONE FINAL THING AND ALEX HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET -- ONE OTHER THING.  YEAH, PLEASE.  THERE WILL BE SOME CRACK POTS. THERE WILL BE SOME FREAKS AND SOME INSURRECTIONISTS THAT WIN TONIGHT. ALL RIGHT? THAT'S A BAD THING, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT WE ALSO HAVE FEDERAL JUDGES. WE HAVE RIGHT-WING FEDERAL JUDGES. WE HAVE FEDERALIST SOCIETY FEDERAL JUDGES WHO GET 65 CHANCES TO BUY INTO DONALD TRUMP'S BULLSHIT AND 65 TIMES -- I'M GOING TO PASS ON THAT AND YOU HAVE DONALD TRUMP SAYING I HAVE PRESIDENTIAL PRIVILEGE. NO, NO YOU DON'T, DON. STRIKE HIM DOWN THERE. I DON'T HAVE TO GIVE MY TAXES. NO, SORRY ABOUT THAT. SEE? WE HAVE -- PEOPLE GO, WHY DO YOU ALWAYS TALK ABOUT MADISONIAN DEMOCRACY? I TALK ABOUT MADISONIAN DEMOCRACY BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEAUTY OF WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE'RE VOTING FOR THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH THIS YEAR. TWO YEARS FROM NOW WE'LL VOTE FOR THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH AND -- AND THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH, BUT THE THING THAT SEPARATES AMERICA FROM EVERY OTHER COUNTRY IS THE RULE OF LAW, AND I DID LEARN THAT IN CONGRESS, ONE OR TWO TRIPS I TOOK, AND I LEARNEDED THAT VERY QUICKLY. I ACTUALLY SAT IN THE CASE, AND I SAW BASICALLY A JUDGE BEING A JUDGE AND A JURY AND EXECUTIONER, BASICALLY, AND I THOUGHT, MAN, WE'VE GOT THIS INCREDIBLE SYSTEM. WE CAN CELEBRATE IT AND WE CAN LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED -- WHATEVER HAPPENS, NOT CATASTROPHIZE I NEVER LOSE. WHOEVER LOSES, REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS LEARN FROM YOUR LOSSES AND MOVE FORWARD.  LET'S LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE GOVERNOR'S RACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT SHAQUILLE BREWSTER HAS MORE ON THOSE RACES RIGHT NOW. TAKE A LOOK. AWAY FROM THE FIGHT FOR CONTROL OF CONGRESS ARE BATTLES FOR GOVERNOR SHIPS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  I WILL WORK MY HEART OUT, AND I WILL FIGHT LIKE HELL FOR THIS STATE AND THE FUTURE OF OKLAHOMA.  36 SEATS UP FOR GRABS, COSTLY AND COMPETITIVE FIGHTS IN NINE STATES INCLUDING THE PRESIDENTIAL BATTLEGROUNDS OF GEORGIA, MICHIGAN AND NEVADA.  HELLO, LAS VEGAS!  THESE RACES GETTING NATIONAL ATTENTION. DEMOCRATS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS WITH CANDIDATES LIKE DOUG MASTRIANO IN PENNSYLVANIA.  VOTING INTEGRITY. WOW. OH, MY GOODNESS I'VE SEEN BETTER ELECTIONS IN AFGHANISTAN. NOT HYPERBOLE.  AS AN NBC NEWS COUNT SHOW HALF OF THE GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES HAVE CAST DOUBT ON THE 2020 ELECTION.  WE'RE GOING TO GET ELECTION INTEGRITY BACK HERE IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN.  IN WISCONSIN, TIM MICHAELS INITIALLY WOULDN'T SAY IF HE WOULD CERTIFY THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IF HIS PARTY CANDIDATE DIDN'T WIN, BUT WHEN PRESSED ON THE ISSUE DURING LAST MONTH'S DEBATE HE SAID HE WOULD AFTER PASSING CHANGES TO ELECTION LAWS CALLING THEM HIS TOP PRIORITY.  CERTAINLY ISSUES AROUND ABORTION. THAT'S A NATIONAL ISSUE. VOTING RIGHTS IS A NATIONAL ISSUE, BUT THE IDEA THAT SOMEHOW WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE OUR VOTING RIGHTS HERE IN WISCONSIN, MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO VOTE. THAT WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN 2024.  REPUBLICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY SEEING MOMENT UP WITH THE FOCUS CRIME, COVID AND ECONOMIC ISSUES.  HELLO, LONG ISLAND! TARGETING RACISTS SEEN AS ONLY DEMOCRAT WEEKS AGO, NOW LOOKING VULNERABLE LIKE THE ONE IN NEW YORK STATE.  YOU KNOW WHY NOTHING CHANGE THE DAY AFTER THE DOBBS DECISION BECAUSE I'M THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND HE'S NOT. DEMOCRATS HITTING HARD ON ABORTION RIGHTS ESPECIALLY IN STATES WHERE ROLE REVERSALS SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED ACCESS.  SHE'S THE ONE WHO SAID A 14-YEAR-OLD CHILD RAPED BY HER UNCLE IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE.  ADDING PRESSURE TO AN ALREADY TENSE CYCLE.  I'M NERVOUS, BUT EXCITED.  WHY NERVOUS?  I THINK THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE AND A LOT OF POLICY DECISIONS THAT WILL BE DERIVED FROM WHAT OUR VOTES LEAD TO.  KNOWING STATEWIDE RACES HAVE NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS, SHAQUILLE BREWSTER, NBC NEWS.  COMING UP, WE'LL HAVE THE LATEST FROM NEVADA WHERE REPUBLICANS ARE FEELING CONFIDENT THEY CAN FLIP A SENATE SEAT. MEANWHILE, IN GEORGIA, THERE'S A LOT OF OPTIMISM WITHIN THE STACY ABRAMS CAMPAIGN. WHY THEY BELIEVE SHE'S IN A BETTER POSITION TO WIN GEORGIA'S GOVERNOR'S RACE THAN SHE WAS FOUR YEARS AGO.  WOW. CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR THAT.  WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. \u266a \u266a \u266a\u266a > ONE DAY THE TV NEWS IS OUT THERE SAYING OH, DEMOCRATS ARE UP IN THE POLLS AND SHATTERING HISTORICAL PRECEDENT AND REPUBLICANS WILL RULE THE NIGHT AND FEAST ON HUMAN FLESH, AND THEN THE NEXT DAY THEY'RE, LIKE -- OR NOT, YOU KNOW? AND TODAY THE LAST DAY BEFORE THE ELECTION, WE SPOTTED THIS ACTUAL HEADLINE IN \"THE DAILY BEAST,\" POLLSTERS HAVE NO [ BLEEP ] IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN THIS ELECTION! REALLY?  THAT'S TRUE.  YOU KNOW WHO TELLS YOU THAT?  POLLSTERS AND CANDIDATES. NOBODY KNOWS.  WE DON'T.  TOM BROKAW YET AGAIN. LET'S LET THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY VOTE FIRST.  WHAT HAPPENS TONIGHT IS ANYONE'S GUESS. WELCOME BACK TO \"MORNING JOE.\" IT IS TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 8th, ELECTION DAY. AT STAKE TODAY THE BALANCE OF POWER IN WASHINGTON AND IN STATES THAT COULD DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF FUTURE ELECTIONS. THE BIDEN AGENDA IS ALSO ON THE LINE AND SOME ARGUE POSSIBLY DEMOCRACY ITSELF. HERE'S THE LAY OF THE LAND UPON. FIRST THE HOUSE, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A 220-212 ADVANTAGE WITH TWO VACANCIES. REPUBLICANS NEED FIVE SEATS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE LOWER CHAMBER. THAT IS THE SMALLEST NUMBER OF SEATS THE PARTY OUT OF POWER HAS NEEDED TO FLIP THE HOUSE IN 90 YEARS.  REMEMBER, MICHAEL -- REPUBLICANS RAN UP MASSIVE NUMBERS, RIGHT, IN '14?  IN '10 AND '14.  IN '10, THE EARLY PROJECTIONS WERE 39 SEATS AND WE PICKED UP 63.  WOW.  YOU KNOW, WITH THAT WAS A COMBINATION OF STATE AND GUBERNATORIAL RACES, AS WELL AND THE ENVIRONMENT TODAY IS VERY DIFFERENT AND I THINK VOTERS HAVE A CHANCE TO RESHAPE AND THAT'S YET POLLSTERS HAVE NO CLUE BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY VOTERS THEY HAVEN'T TALKED TO AND SO MANY VOTERS WAITING BY THEIR LANDLINE.  I THINK IF YOU'RE A HOUSE REPUBLICAN, YOU HAVE TO HOPE THAT YOU DO AT LEAST AS WELL AS THE DEMOCRATS DID IN 2018, AT LEAST, DURING THE TRUMP ERA WHEN DEMOCRATS PICKED UP 40 SEATS. SO IF YOU'RE A REPUBLICAN AND YOU DON'T GET 40 SEATS, YOU KNOW? IT'S PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT OF A DISAPPOINTMENT BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS BREAKING THE REPUBLICANS' WAY IN THE HOUSE.  THAT WOULD BE MORE OF A RED SPLASH, BUT I GUARANTEE THAT THE MESSAGING IS THAT IT IS A HUGE VICTORY IF THEY WIN 20-30 WHEREAS AGAINST PRESIDENT OBAMA REPUBLICANS PICKED UP 63 SEATS. SO IT'S JUST REPUBLICANS ARE ALREADY CRUSHING IT ON THE MESSAGING FRONT AND DEMOCRATS JUST KIND OF SEEM TO BE, MAYBE DEMOCRACY WILL SURVIVE.  OH, MY LORD. THAT'S NOT HOW THEY FEEL, THAT'S FOR SURE. AS WE KNOW FOR THE SENATE IT'S A 50-50 SPLIT MEANING REPUBLICANS NEED TO GAIN ONE SEAT TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE UPPER CHAMBER. WE'RE WATCHING THE SENATE RACES IN NINE BATTLEGROUND STATES WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ARIZONA, NEVADA, NEW HAMPSHIRE, WISCONSIN AND PENNSYLVANIA, AND NOW TO THE 36 GOVERNORS RACES, MANY IN PRESIDENTIAL BATTLE GROUNDS AS WE SAW IN 2020. THESE RACES MATTER FOR THE CERTIFICATION OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE RESULTS. RIGHT NOW REPUBLICANS HOLD 28 GOVERNOR SHIPS, DEMOCRATS, 22. MORE THAN 44 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY CAST A BALLOT EITHER BY MAIL OR IN PERSON OUTPACING THE 2018 MID-TERMS BY MORE THAN 5 MILLION VOTES, WILLIE.  WE HAVE NBC REPORTERS FANNED OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY COVERING THOSE KEY RACES. VAUGHN HILLIARD IS IN ARIZONA AND TREMANE LEE AND VAUGHN, SET THE SCENE FOR US THERE?  LET'S BE VERY CLEAR HERE, WILLIE. THERE ARE NUMEROUS RACES FROM ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SECRETARY OF STATE IN WHICH REPUBLICANS ARE RUNNING AS ELECTION DENIERS. OF COURSE, YOU'VE GOT U.S. SENATE CANDIDATE BLAKE MASTERS WHO HAS CONSISTENTLY TRAILED MARK KELLY IN POLLS HERE, YET THAT'S WHAT BRINGS IN KARI LAKE INTO THE EQUATION. SHE'S THIS REPUBLICAN PHENOMENA, PERHAPS DONALD TRUMP'S FAVORITE CANDIDATE IN 2022 AND SHE'S TRYING TO DRAG ALONG THE LIKES OF BLAKE MASTERS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE BECAUSE SHE'S CONSISTENTLY OUTPOLLED THE OTHER REPUBLICANS HERE AND SHE'S CONSISTENTLY, THOUGH BY A NARROW MARGIN LED DEMOCRAT KATIE HOBBS IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA. I THINK WHEN WE TALK ABOUT KARI LAKE TODAY, IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT KARI LAKE, NOT ONLY THIS WEEK HAS RETURNED TO THE KARI LAKE THAT ROSE TO PROMINENCE AND WAS ABLE TO CARRY THE FAVOR OF DONALD TRUMP. SHE CAMPAIGNED ALONG THE LIKES OF STEVE BANNON AND SHE CAMPAIGNED ALONG ONE OF THE PROMINENT PROMOTERS OF PIZZAGATE AND ALONGSIDE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO PROPAGATED THE IDEA OF A WAR ON WHITE PEOPLE. THIS WEEK SHE CALLED FOR THE PROSECUTION AND CRIMINAL CHARGES TO BE HANDED DOWN TO THOSE WHO WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR COVID RESPONSE HERE IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA. SHE'S CALLED FOR THE PROSECUTION AND THE JAILING OF JOURNALISTS AND SHE'S CALLED FOR THE PROSECUTION AND THE JAILING OF ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO JUST LAST NIGHT AGAIN SUGGESTED THAT HERE, FOR GOVERNOR'S RACE WITHOUT PROVIDING SPECIFIC EVIDENCE AND SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS IS SUGGESTING IT COULD BE RIGGED. THIS IS AN INDIVIDUAL KARI LAKE WHO HAS CONTINUED TO BE THE UNABASHED CONSPIRACY THEORIST THAT LED HER TO THE GOP NOMINATION AND POTENTIALLY IS ON THE CUSP OF BECOMING THE NEXT GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA. THIS IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS SAID THAT SHE INTENDS TO SERVE OUT HER TERM AS ARIZONA GOVERNOR, BUT IT'S HARD WHEN YOU SEE THE NUMBER OF FORMER WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS THAT HAVE COME INTO ARIZONA TO HELP OUT HER CANDIDACY, REALIZING WHAT SHE HAS IN STORE. IT IS HARD TO TURN AWAY FROM THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ARIZONA VOTERS HERE COULD CHOOSE, KNOWINGLY CHOOSE THAT SOMEBODY WHO HAS DENIED AND CALLED FOR THE DE-CERTIFICATION OF THE 2020 ELECTION COULD ULTIMATELY TAKE THE REINS OF THE STATE WITH THE MAJORITIES IN THE REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE AND RECONFIGURE HOW POTENTIALLY ELECTIONS ARE RUN HERE IN THE STATE AND POTENTIALLY EVEN THE COURTS WOULD PROBABLY STEP IN AND TRY TO DECERTIFY THE 2020 ELECTION.  SHE CERTAINLY IS A CANDIDATE IN DONALD TRUMP'S MOLD. ALL OF THAT IS TRUE, VAUGHN, BUT THE VOTERS DO GET A CHANCE TO SAY IF SHE BECOMES GOVERNOR OF ARIZONA. TREMANE LEE IN ARIZONA LOOKING VERY CLOSELY AT THAT SENATE RACE WHICH MAY TAKE US, TREMANE, INTO NEXT MONTH THAT'S RIGHT, WILLIE. GEORGIANS HAVE SHOWED UP IN RECORD HISTORY. IF STACY WINS SHE'LL BE THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY. YOU MENTIONED THE RACE BETWEEN RAFAEL WARNOCK AND HERSCHEL WALKER. WHEN RAPHAEL WON HE WAS THE FIRST IN A CONFEDERATE STATE IN HISTORY AND NOW IT WILL BE LESHL WALKER OR RAPHAEL WARNOCK. THE GAME HERE IS TURNOUT, TURNOUT, TURNOUT. HB-202 WHICH RESTRICTED AND LIMITED VOTING IN THE STATE AND HOW IT MAY IMPACT BLACK VOTERS AND THEY'LL SHOW UP IN NUMBERS HIGHER THAN REGISTERED VOTERS. RAPHAEL WARNOCK HAS HELD A SLIM LEAD, BUT STILL NECK AND NECK, AND IT WILL BE A TURNOUT BATTLE ASK IT WAS NOT LOST ON ANYONE HERE, BUT THE POLLS MAY SAY ONE THING AND IT'S ABOUT WHO COMES UP AND VOTES TODAY. STACY ABRAMS CAMP HAS BEEN EXCITED SAYING MAYBE WE'LL BUCK THE POLL BECAUSE OF THAT APPARATUS. IN THIS STATE, GEORGIA, GROUND ZERO FOR THE MOBILIZATION EFFORT. THERE ARE EFFORTS TO PUSH BACK AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE ORGANIZING AND GET VOTERS OUT.  YES. MASSIVE EARLY VOTING IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA. TREMANE LEE IN ATLANTA. WE APPRECIATE IT.  LET'S SWING OUT TO VEGAS WHERE WE FIND JACOB SOBOROFF.  HEY, WILLIE, THE TOP OF THE RACE IS MASTO AND ADAM LAXALT. YOU WILL REMEMBER HE WAS ONE OF THE CHIEF ELECTION DENIERS OUT HERE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION ELECTION AND I WAS THERE AND WATCHED WITH MY OWN EYES WHO LATER RAN TO THEIR WAITING SPRINTER VAN. IT'S BEEN SINCE DEBUNKED BY THE REPUBLICAN SECRETARY OF STATE HERE, OF COURSE, BUT IN ADDITION TO THE ISSUES, AFFORDABILITY, ABORTION, YOU NAME IT. TOP OF MIND AND ESPECIALLY ELECTION OFFICIALS IS SAFEGUARDING THE INTEGRITY OF THE ELECTION AND YESTERDAY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ANNOUNCED IT WAS GOING TO SEND FEDERAL MONITORS AND JURISDICTIONS ALL THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S CIVIL AND VOTING RIGHTS. I ASKED JOE GLORIA FROM CLARK COUNTY, AND LAS VEGAS, NEVADA AND WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT INSIDE HIS ELECTION HEADQUARTERS YESTERDAY AND THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD ME. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SAID THEY'LL SEND MONITORS TO 64 DIFFERENT ELECTION JURISDICTIONS TO MONITOR FOR VOTING RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. HAVE THEY CALLED YOU? WOULD YOU WELCOME THOSE MONITORS?  ABSOLUTELY. THEY'RE NOT HERE BECAUSE OF CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. THEY'RE HERE TO MONITOR TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR THEM TO BE HERE. THEY WERE HERE IN 2020. THEY COME AROUND. I USUALLY DON'T EVEN SEE THEM. THEY END UP GIVING ME A REPORT WHEN THE ELECTION IS OVER. SO WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE AND THIS IS A LARGE COUNTY IN THE STATE OF NEVADA.  I UNDERSTAND THEY HAD CALLS WITH THE SECRETARIES OF STATE TODAY AND HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE MONITORING EFFORT AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT IT?  THEY CALLED ME LAST WEEK AND GAVE ME THEIR REPRESENTATIVE AND THEIR PHONE NUMBER SO WE KNOW THEY'LL BE CIRCULATING THROUGH THE COUNTY TOMORROW.  THAT'S JOE GLORIA, THE MAN IN CHARGE OF ELECTIONS IN LAS VEGAS AND CLARK COUNTY, NEVADA. SHOUT OUT TO THEM DOING NON-PARTISAN ELECTION WORK. JOE GLORIA WANTS EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE AN EARLY NIGHT IN NEVADA IF THE RACE IS CLOSE. NOT ONLY THOSE MAIL-IN BALLOTS THAT WE SAW BEHIND US WHEN WE WERE TALKING, BUT THE EARLY VOTE AND IT COULD BE TEN DAYS HERE IN NEVADA BEFORE WE HAVE A FINAL, CERTIFIED RESULT OUT OF CLARK COUNTY IF SENATOR MASTO AND ADAM LAXALT HAVE A TIGHT RACE TONIGHT, GUYS.  THEY ARE EXPECTED TO BE TIGHT IN NEVADA OPINION JACOB SOBOROFF IN NEVADA, TREMANE LEE IN GEORGIA AND VAUGHN HILLIARD, AND WE'LL GO TO FLORIDA, PENNSYLVANIA AND WISCONSIN.  DEAN OF PUBLIC SERVICE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS, VICTORIA DI FRANCESCO SOTO. HE'S OUTSIDE WITH A PIECE WHY DEMOCRATS ARE LOSING HISPANIC VOTERS. LET'S READ FROM TIM'S PIECE. THE LEFT HAS ALIENATED THE VOTERS. THE FIRST IS THAT IT REQUIRED THE PRESIDENCY OF DONALD TRUMP FOR SOME DEMOCRATS TO QUESTION THEIR OWN DOGMA. TRUMP IS SUPPOSED TO BE UNIQUELY UNACCEPTABLE TO MINORITIES AND HISPANICS IN PARTICULAR, YET DEMOCRATS DIDN'T SEE MAJOR GAINS DURING HIS FOUR YEARS IN OFFICE, INSTEAD, THEIR MARGIN SHRANK. THE SECOND IRONY, THE VERY THING THAT BREATHES LIFE INTO THE PARTY, THE FOCUS ON IDENTITY AND INCLUSION IS MAKING IT MORE POPULAR WITH WHIT VOTERS AND LESS POPULAR WITH HISPANIC VOTERS AND TIM, LET ME ADD TO THAT BLACK VOTERS ACCORDING TO REVEREND AL SHARPTON WHO SAYS THAT HE IS BAFFLED AND HIS PARISHIONERS WHEREVER HE GOES ARE BAFFLED BY SOME OF THE MORE PROGRESSIVE STANCE THE FAR LEFT TAKES ON RACIAL JUSTICE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT DAVID SHORE STARTED WARNING DEMOCRATS ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.  JOE. THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. THIS IS NOT THAT COMPLICATED. WE WANT TO TREAT THIS, PERHAPS, LIKE IT'S A MYSTERY, BUT IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO SIMPLE REALITY THAT YOU HEAR FROM DEMOCRATS OF COLOR AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THEY BELIEVE THAT THEIR PARTY HAS, OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, MADE A SORT OF CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO APPEAL TO AFFLUENT, UPPER MIDDLE-CLASS SUBURBAN WIDES AND TO THEIR SORT OF CULTURAL CONCERNS AT THE EXPENSE OF THE EVERYDAY ECONOMIC CONCERNS OF WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE OF COLOR AND IT'S BASICALLY THAT SIMPLE AND THIS HAS PLAYED OUT IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. YOU SEE IT IN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY AND YOU SEE IT IN THE SOUTHWEST. AT THE END OF THE DAY, IF THERE WAS AN EASY ANSWER TO THIS FOR DEMOCRATS, I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN REACHING FOR IT ALREADY, BUT IT'S NOT AN EASY ANSWER AND IT'S MANIFESTING ITSELF IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND WHAT WE WILL SEE IS A VALIDATION OF WHAT DAVID SHORE AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.  VICTORIA, YOU LOOK AT FLORIDA, AND I REMEMBER IN 2020 HOW WELL DONALD TRUMP DID WITH HISPANIC VOTERS IN MIAMI-DADE. OF COURSE, THE SAME DONALD TRUMP THAT CALLED HISPANICS BREEDERS, CALLED MEXICANS THAT CAME ACROSS THE BORDER RAPISTS AND WE CAN GO DOWN THE LONG LIST AND YET HE PICKED UP GAINS. IN MIAMI-DADE, WE ARE TOLD BY REPUBLICAN DATA SPECIALISTS IN FLORIDA THAT RON DESANTIS IS GOING TO WIN FLORIDA WITH HISPANICS STATEWIDE AND IT'S GOING TO BE A MASSIVE SWEEP THROUGH MIAMI-DADE COUNTY. WHAT DO YOU THINK IS CAUSING THIS?  THE STRENGTH OF TRUMP IN FLORIDA AND OTHER POCKETS HAS TO DO WITH THE DIVERSITY OF THE LATINO POPULATION. TRUMP HAS BEEN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE AT TARGETING FOLKS WHO COME FROM COUNTRIES WHERE THERE HAS BEEN SOCIALISM AND THAT IS A MESSAGE THAT HE HAS HAMMERED HOME, AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO PULL THOSE LATINOS OVER. CUBAN-AMERICAN, NICARAGUANS, COLOMBIANS, BUT IN TERMS OF TIM'S PIECE OF WHY ARE WE SEEING THIS MOVEMENT, HE DOES POINT OUT THAT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT LATINOS HAD BEEN SWING VOTERS. WE KIND OF FORGOT ABOUT IT, BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS EVEN GOING BACK IT 1984, RONALD REAGAN SAYING, HEY, HISPANICS ARE REPUBLICAN. THEY JUST DON'T KNOW IT YET. REPUBLICANS HAD STARTED TARGETING LATINOS BACK IN THE '80s. THEY KIND OF FELL BACK AND THEN GEORGE W. BUSH DID A VERY HARD PUSH AND LATINOS WERE UP FOR GRABS IN THE 2000s. McCAIN JUST KIND OF GAVE UP ON LATINOS, AS DID ROMNEY AS DID TRUMP IN 2016 AND THEN OVER THE 2018, 2019 YEARS WE SAW TRUMP AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY COURT LATINOS. IT'S NOT SO MUCH THAT WE'RE SEEING A TURN TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR LATINOS AND RATHER THERE WAS THIS DORMANT SWINGINGNESS AMONG LATINOS AND REPUBLICANS ARE BACK IN THE FIGHT AND TRYING TO COURT THAT VOTE.  SO, TIM, READING THROUGH YOUR EXHAUSTIVE PIECE WHICH IS AS USUAL FOR YOU, REALLY AND IT GETS INTO THE PROBLEM AT SOME LENGTH IN A REALLY SMART WAY, THERE'S A MOMENT FROM DANNY ORTEGA WHO SERVED AS AN ICON IN ARIZONA WHERE HE SAYS EFFECTIVELY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS A CREDIBILITY CRISIS AND IT'S NOT SPECIFIC TO IMMIGRATION. WHAT IS THAT CREDIBILITY CRISIS? WHAT ARE LATINO VOTERS NOT HEARING FROM DEMOCRATS THAT THEY USED TO HEAR OR INSTEAD THEY'RE HEARING FROM REPUBLICANS? YEAH, WILLIE, WHAT I HEARD FROM DANNY ORTEGA IS WHAT I HEARD FROM HISPANIC DEMOCRATS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY IS THAT THEY ARE STARTING TO FEEL LIKE THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS SORT OF MANIPULATING THEM, AND SORT OF USING THEM IN WAYS THAT MAYBE THEY HAD SUSPECTED IN YEARS PAST, BUT WERE WILLING TO SORT OF GIVE THEM A PASS FOR IT, BUT NOW IT'S COME TO A HEAD. THEY HEAR WHEN THEY HEAR SOME OF THIS RHETORIC AROUND, YOU KNOW, SOCIAL JUSTICE AND NOT JUST SOCIAL JUSTICE BROADLY, BUT DEMOCRACY UNDER ATTACK. IN ARIZONA, SPECIFICALLY, AS VAUGHN POINTED OUT IN HIS REPORT EARLIER, THIS IS AN ISSUE ON THE GROUND AND A REAL THING AND YET FOR A LOT OF HISPANIC VOTERS, THERE'S ALMOST A BOY WHO CRIED WOLF DYNAMIC WHERE THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY'VE BEEN HEARING FOR THE LAST NUMBER OF DECADES THAT REPUBLICANS ARE COMING FOR YOU, YOU BETTER VOTE DEMOCRATIC OR ELSE AND NOW THEY LOOK AT VAUGHN AND SAY WHERE IS THIS ASPIRATIONAL ABILITY AND TALK THAT WE HEARD FROM THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN. INSTEAD IT IS ALL FEAR AND LOATHING. WHEN IT COMES TO IMMIGRATION, GAY RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS, A LOT OF DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE THE SORT OF MORAL HIGH GROUND HERE, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY'RE NOT SPEAKING TO THE ISSUES THAT ARE MOST DIRECTLY RESIDENT WITH WORKING AND MIDDLE-CLASS VOTERS IN THESE PLACES AND THEY'LL PAY A PRICE FOR IT TONIGHT.  VICTORIA, FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, FROM TIM'S PIECE AND THE SEGMENT RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW WHAT HAVE THE DEMOCRATS DONE OTHER THAN PERHAPS TAKEN HISPANIC VOTERS FOR GRANTED. WHAT ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST TO HISPANICS GENERALLY HAVE THEY MISSED OUT ON?  I THINK IT'S THE TREATMENT OF IMMIGRATION IS ONE OF THE WEAKNESSES HERE WHERE LATINOS ARE VERY DIVERSE IN TERMS OF THEIR GENERATION. THERE ARE SOME WHO LITERALLY THE BORDER CROSSED THEIR FAMILY AND THEY'RE NOT IMMIGRANTS THEMSELVES. SO FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT FOCUS IMMIGRATION DID NOT RESONATE AS WIDELY AS SOME IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MIGHT HAVE THE THOUGHT AND I THINK THAT IS ONE. THE OTHER PIECE IS THE ECONOMICS OF IT. SO WHILE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS MATTER AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION ON THAT OVER THE SUMMER, FOR LATINOS AN WORKING-CLASS LATINOS AND THOSE THAT ARE MIDDLE CLASS, MIDDLE UPPER CLASS, IT SHOULDN'T BE TO THE EXCLUSION OF ECONOMICS AND IT IS A FOCUS REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND FOCUS ON IMMIGRATION AND FORGETTING THE CORE ECONOMIC PIECE AND YOU CAN HAVE MORE THAN ONE ISSUE THAT YOU'RE TARGETING AND THE TROUBLE IS THE LACK OF MICROTARGETING WITH THESE ELECTORS AND THE LAST POINT IS JUST GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED DIRECT MOBILIZATION. THE LATEST POLL THAT CAME OUT FROM NALEO SAID 40% OF LATINOS HAD YET TO BE CONTACTED BY EITHER PARTY? A COUPLE OF POINTS HERE, MICHAEL. FIRST OF ALL, WHEN YOU ASK PEOPLE IN MIAMI WHAT HAPPENED IN 2020, THEY SAID TRUMP SHOWED UP. TRUMP FOCUSED. HE FOCUSED ON HISPANICS. HE WENT IN HARD. THE BIDEN CAMPAIGN DID NOT. THAT'S THE FIRST THING AND THE SECOND THING, AND I WANT TO TOUCH ON WHAT VICTORIA SAID WAS THE ASPIRATIONAL MESSAGE. THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT EMIGRATED HERE. THEY WANT TO HEAR THE ASPIRATIONAL MESSAGE. TIM'S PIECE TALKED ABOUT IT AND I WANT TO HEAR FROM HISPANIC LEADERS WHERE HISPANICS FOR WHATEVER REASON DON'T THINK THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS AN ASPIRATIONAL PARTY. THEY ARE HERE IN AMERICA TO BETTER THEMSELVES. THEY ARE HERE IN AMERICA TO SUCCEED, AND THEY'RE GETTING THAT MESSAGE MORE FROM REPUBLICANS ECONOMICALLY. THEY ARE --  I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN JUST THE ECONOMIC PIECE. THE OTHER THING THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME TO WATCH BECAUSE WE SEE IT PLAY OUT AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN, AS WELL, IS THAT TRUMP PLAYS UP THE MACHISMO. HE PLAYS THIS SORT OF, YOU KNOW, SOFT AGGRESSIVE KIND OF MALE THING AND THAT HAS A LEVEL OF APPEAL, AS WELL. SO YOU HAVE THE COMBINATION OF THE ASPIRATIONAL, I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY, I WANT TO DO WELL. I WANT TO BE BETTER WITH THE CONNECTION BACK TO SOME OF THOSE CULTURAL ROOTS WHERE, YOU KNOW, THE WAY SOCIETY MAY HAVE BEEN STRUCTURED BACK HOME. THEY'RE NOT SITTING THERE TALKING ABOUT LGBTQ AND TRANS GENDER.  RIGHT.  THEY LOOK AT THE FAMILY UNIT VERY DIFFERENTLY. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THAT MESSAGING WORK FOR THEM WHICH IS INTERESTING AND SOMEWHAT IRONIC WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE AUTOPSY OF 2012 WHICH WAS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THAT WHICH DONALD TRUMP COMES DOWN FOUR YEARS LATER AND GOES, WELL, ALL MEXICANS ARE RAPISTS AND MURDERERS AND WE'LL BUILD A WALL KEEP THEM OUT AND TWO YEARS AFTER THAT THE LIGHT BULB COMES BACK ON BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT WHAT THEY SAW FROM TRUMP IN 2016 WAS THE DEATH KNELL. THEY CAME BACK IN A SOFTER WAY, TO YOUR POINT, TALKING AND CONNECTING THE ASPIRATIONAL TO THAT SORT OF FAMILY ORIENTED THING AND THE THING THAT APPEALS TO THOSE MEN ABOUT I'M THE MAN OF MY HOUSEHOLD, YOU KNOW, AND THAT HAD A CERTAIN RESONANCE FOR A LOT OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN AND HISPANIC MEN, AS WELL.  VICTORIA DI FRANCESCO, THE DEAN, AND TIM ALBERTA, WE'LL BE READING THE PIECE THAT YOU WROTE FOR \"THE ATLANTIC.\" IN OHIO LAST NIGHT, DONALD TRUMP SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE THE ATTENTION AWAY FROM ELECTION DAY, SO WHY THEN DOES HE KEEP THE FOCUS HIMSELF RATHER THAN THE CANDIDATES HE'S ENDORSING LIKE STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM? PLUS BREAKING DOWN TONIGHT'S POTENTIAL BELLWETHERS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT A HANDFUL OF IMPORTANT RACES THAT FORECASTERS SAY WILL BE SIGNIFICANT IN DETERMINING THE STATE OF DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA.

THEY BELIEVE IN YOU, AND IF YOU SAY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE, THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO VOTE AS WELL. I AM ASKING YOU TO RESPOND TO THIS MESSAGE WITH YOUR OWN HARD, YOUR OWN WORDS, WHY THIS ELECTION IS SO IMPORTANT TO YOU, AND WHETHER YOU HAVE ALREADY VOTED, OR ARE PLANNING TO VOTE ON TUESDAY. I BET IF YOU DO THAT, IT WILL BREAK THROUGH TO THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIVES, THE FOLKS THAT HAVE THE POWER TO DECIDE THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION, AND TOGETHER, WE WILL WIN.  BETO A ROCK IS EASING HIS FINAL DAYS IN THE CAMPAIGN TO TURN OUT AS MANY VOTERS AS POSSIBLE, VISITING COLLEGE CAMPUSES, KNOCKING ON DOORS, AND SPEAKING TO CROWDS AND CAMPAIGN STOPS ACROSS TEXAS. SOME OF THOSE VOTERS ARE ALSO RECEIVING THIS CALL FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA.  A REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, GREG ABBOTT HAS SIGNED ONE OF THE MOST EXTREME ABORTION LAWS IN AMERICA. BETO O'ROURKE WILL PROTECT WOMEN'S RIGHTS TATTOOS. ON GUN SAFETY, GREG ABBOTT MADE IT EASIER TO BUY GUNS JUST BEFORE 19 KIDS AND THEIR TEACHERS WERE MURDERED IN UVALDE. BETO OR WILL WORK TO RESTORE COMMON SENSE. ON HEALTH CARE, GRAVE ABBOTT REFUSED TO BRING HOME MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN MEDICARE MONEY TO GIVE MORE TEXANS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. BETO WILL DO WHAT'S RIGHT. AN ISSUE AFTER ISSUE, BETO O'ROURKE WILL RESTORE COMMENTS AND DECENCY TO TEXAS STATE GOVERNMENT. THAT'S WHY WE'RE ASKING YOU TO VOTE FOR THEM, AND HELP BUILD THE AMERICA THAT WE DESERVE.  JOINING US NOW IS BETO OR WORK, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR OF TEXAS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US ON WHAT WILL BE YOUR FINAL APPEARANCE AT THIS HOUR AS A CANDIDATE IN TEXAS. WHAT HAVE YOU LEARNED IN THIS LONG CAMPAIGN THAT YOU BRING TO THE FINAL DAY OF THE CAMPAIGN, THAT YOU WANT TO LEAVE WITH TEXANS BEFORE THEY VOTE TOMORROW.  WE, THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS ARE ABSOLUTELY EXTRAORDINARY. YOU HAVE EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD THAT IS BEING THROWN AT US IN RECENT YEARS. THE POWER GRID FAILURE THAT KILLED 700 PEOPLE IN THE ENERGY CAPITAL OF THE WORLD, DOMESTIC STREAM ABORTION BAN IN A STATE THAT IS AT THE EPICENTER OF A MATERNAL MORTALITY CRISIS. WE LEAD THE NATION IN SCHOOL SHOOTINGS, GUN VIOLENCE, THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR CHILDREN AND TEENAGERS. WE HAVE SEEN PROPERTY TAXES GO UP, ELECTRICITY BILLS GO UP, AND YET INSTEAD OF SUCCUMBING TO THE TEMPTATION OF DESPAIR, TEXANS HAVE STOOD UP TO OVERCOME THIS. AND IN RECORD NUMBERS. IT'S FOLKS FROM ACROSS THE STATE, INCLUDING THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT I SAW TODAY AT TEXAS STATE AND TEXAS A&M, AND -- VOTERS THAT WILL BE CASTING THEIR FIRST BALLOTS IN THE FIRST ELECTIONS, NOT SHOWING UP IN ANYBODY'S POLLS, NOBODY'S FORECAST. THEIR VOICES HAVE NEVER BEEN HEARD AND THEIR VOTES HAVE NEVER BEEN COUNTED. THEY REPRESENT THE MARGIN OF VICTORY TO BRING US THROUGH NOT JUST THE STOP THE BAD STUFF FROM HAPPENING. ALL OF THAT IS URGENT. BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO TRULY GREAT THINGS FOR ONE ANOTHER LIKE FOCUSING ON WORLD-CLASS PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND PAYING THOSE EDUCATORS AND ENOUGH TO NOT HAVE TO WORK A SECOND OR THIRD JOB. EXPANDING MEDICAID, AS THE PRESIDENT DESCRIBED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BACK TO OUR STATE AND CONNECT MILLIONS OF TEXANS WITH CARE THAT WILL LITERALLY SAVE AND IMPROVE THEIR LIVES. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE WANT TO DO. DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INTO TAMPA AND IT'S ALIKE, WE ARE SO MUCH BETTER THAN THOSE WHO REPRESENT OR SERVICE IN OFFICE RIGHT NOW. WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT TONIGHT. 7 PM, MOUNTAIN STANDARD TIME AS THE POLLS CLOSE IN MY HOMETOWN OF EL PASO. AFTER THAT, WE WILL BE WATCHING THE RETURNS, AND HOPE TO BE CELEBRATED TOGETHER WITH THE PEOPLE OF TEXAS.  I WANT TO GO BACK TO THAT POINT YOU MADE A MEDICAID EXPANSION, WITH THAT COULD MEAN FOR TEXAS. ESPECIALLY AT A TIME OF INFLATION WHERE OBVIOUSLY HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE ALWAYS PART OF INFLATION. THEY GO UP HIGHER THAN THE NORMAL INFLATION RATE. THIS IS A OPPORTUNITY, IF TEXAS WERE TO EXPAND MEDICAID UNDER THE FORMAL CARE ACT. TO HELP PEOPLE WITH THE COST OF SOMETHING AS CRUCIAL AS HEALTH CARE. WHAT IS THE REPUBLICAN REASON FOR REFUSING TO DO THAT AS THEY HAVE REPEATEDLY REFUSED TO DO IT IN TEXAS?  THERE REALLY ISN'T ONE. IN FACT, A LOT OF REPUBLICANS AGREE WITH MEDICAID'S EXPANSION. OUR FOUR NEIGHBORING STATES, LOUISIANA, ARKANSAS, OKLAHOMA, NEW MEXICO, THREE WITH REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS. THEY HAVE ALL EXPANDED MEDICAID. IT BRINGS BACK YOUR FEDERAL INCOME TAX DOLLARS THAT YOU ALREADY PAID UP TO D.C. TO CONNECT TO PEOPLE IN YOUR STATE WITH CARE. IT CREATES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS ANNUALLY, AND THE KICKER FOR US IN TEXAS WHERE WE HAVE SEEN OUR PROPERTY TAXES GO UP 20 BILLION DOLLARS UNDER GREG ABBOTT. IT'S TO BRING THOSE PROPERTY TAXES DOWN, BECAUSE WE'RE NO LONGER ON THE HOOK FOR UNCOMPLICATED ENERGY CARE AT OUR COUNTY HOSPITALS. AND AT A STATE WHEN WE ARE LEADING THE NATION IN CHILDHOOD DIABETES DEATHS, THE STATE'S 51ST BEHIND EVERY OTHER AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN MENTAL HEALTH CARE ACCESS, TO THE POINT THAT OUR JAILS ARE THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE STATE TODAY. THIS IS GOING TO HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE. THERE'S NO GOOD REASON NOT TO DO IT. IN FACT, THE ONLY PERSON STANDING IN THE WAY RIGHT NOW IS GREG ABBOTT. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO TURN THE PAGE ON HIM, VOTE FOR CHANGE, AND MOVE FORWARD WITH GREAT, BIG IDEAS AND ENJOY BIPARTISAN SUPPORT, LIKE EXPANDING MEDICAID.  GOVERNOR ABBOTT SEEMS TO ADMITTED THAT IT IS UNCLEAR IN TEXAS WHEN THE DOCTORS CAN ACT TO SAVE THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER IN A POSSIBLE ABORTION PROCEDURE THAT COULD BE LEGAL TO THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER. HOW DID IT COME TO THIS? WHAT IS IF THE TEXAS NEEDS TO DO?  THIS IS THE MOST EXTREME ABORTION BAN IN AMERICA, NO EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE, INCEST, AND TO YOUR POINT, THERE IS REALLY EFFECTIVELY, FUNCTIONALLY, NO EXCEPTION FOR THE LIFE OF THE WOMAN. I KNOW THIS FROM HAVING LISTENED TO SO MANY WOMEN ACROSS THE STATE OF TEXAS WHO DESCRIBED STORIES OF INTENDED PREGNANCIES. ONES WHERE, AS THE FETUS DEVELOPS, AND THEY'VE ALREADY CHOSEN A NAME FOR WHAT THEY HOPED WOULD BE THEIR CHILD, ONLY TO LEARN THAT THE COMPLICATIONS WERE SO SEVERE THAT IN SOME CASES, THE FETUS WAS NOT VIABLE, OR EVEN DEAD. AND YET DOCTORS COULD NOT PERFORM THE SURGERIES,, OR PROVIDE THE MEDICARE HELP THE THING NEED, BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO UNCLEAR ABOUT THIS LAW. THEY'VE ASKED THESE WOMEN TO COME BACK WHEN THEY ARE LITERALLY ON DEATHS YOUR. LUCKILY, THE WOMEN THAT I MET WERE ABLE TO SURVIVE. SOMEBODY GOING TO OTHER STATES, SOME BY BEING ABLE TO PREVAIL UPON THESE DOCTORS THAT THEY'RE ABOUT TO DIE. BUT IN A STATE THAT LEADS THE COUNTRY IN THIS EPIDEMIC OF MORNEAU MORTALITY, THREE TIMES AS DEADLY FOR BLACK WOMEN, THIS IS GOING TO CONSIGN MORE WOMEN TO SUFFERING AND DEATH, ANOTHER REASON TO VOTE FOR CHANGE TOMORROW IN TEXAS.  BETO ORC, DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US TONIGHT. THANK YOU FOR GIVING US YOUR CLOSING ARGUMENT.  THANK YOU, LAWRENCE.  TONIGHT'S LAST WORD IS NEXT.

        "trs": "> ELECTION EVE, WE ARE BACK WITH JAMES CARVILLE AS WE TURN FOR THE FIRST TIME TO NEW NUMBERS TONIGHT. TALK ABOUT REPUBLICAN MOMENTUM, INCUMBENTS DO USUALLY LOSE SEATS IN THESE, BUT SOME OF THE NUMBERS TELL A DIFFERENT STORY. LET ME TAKE YOU THROUGH THE FACTS. MORE PEOPLE ARE VOTING EARLY. I MENTIONED THAT. THAT COULD MEAN ANYTHING. COULD MEAN A GENERAL SHIFT AS MORE VOTERS BECOME COMFORTABLE WITH THE HABIT OF THE VOTING EARLY, NOT NECESSARILY ALIGN BY PARTY. BUT THE NEW VOTE TOTALS WE HAVE TONIGHT SHOW PARTY REGISTRATION IN MANY STATES. AT THIS POINT IN 2018, LET ME SHOW YOU WHY DEMOCRATS ARE GETTING EXCITED IN SOME PLACES. THIS IS 2018 WHEN REPUBLICAN HAD HIGHER TURNOUT IN OHIO. DEMOCRATS NOW HAVE A HIGHER TURNOUT BY FIVE POINTS. GO TO GEORGIA, WHICH HAS SEEN ITS SHARE OF EXCITEMENT AND SHIFTS. FOUR YEAR AGO, REPUBLICANS WERE LEADING IN THE EARLY TURNOUT BY FIVE POINTS. NOW DEMOCRATS LEADING THERE IN THE EARLY TURN CROWD BY AWHOPPING EIGHT PLUS POINTS. NOW, LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. THIS DOES NOT TELL YOU WHO WILL WIN. TYPICALLY THE MAJORITY OF VOTES ARE CAST ON ELECTION DAY, WHICH IS TOMORROW. BUT IT DOES OFFER A TREND LINE -- DEMOCRAT GETTING EXCITED ABOUT TURNOUT IN BIG STATES. THEN THERE'S A SEARCH FOR REPUBLICANS IN FLORIDA IN 2018. THEY LED IN EARLY VOTES BY TWO POINTS. NOW DOING BETTER, LEADING BY SEVEN. FINALLY, WISCONSIN, A KEY STATE THAT TRUMP WON IN 2016. REPUBLICANS LED BY TEN POINTS IN EARLY VOTING IN '18. RIGHT NOW WISCONSIN DEMOCRATS LEAD EARLY VOTING BY THREE POINTS BASED ON THESE TARGET SMART NUMBERS. JAMES CARVILLE IS BACK WITH US. AS YOU KNOW, JAMES, PEOPLE LOVE POLLS. THEY LOVE THAT GENERIC BALLOT POLL. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, AIN'T NO GENERIC BALLOT ELECTION. YOU CAN POLL IT AND TALK ABOUT IT. IN THREE OF THE FOUR STATES HAVE KEY TURNOUT. YOU'RE ON THE RECORD. WE'LL CHECK BACK WHETHER YOU'RE RIGHT OR NOT, BUT WHAT DOES THAT SAY TO YOU TONIGHT?  I'M ON THE DIFFERENT END A THAT.  YOU'RE IN THE BARN.  YEAH, I'M IN THE BARN. THOSE NUMBERS ARE IMPRESSIVE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN, BUT GEE, I LOOKED AT THEM GOING, THAT BIG OF A TURN AROUND? WHAT IT MEANS TOUGH ASK CHARLIE OR DAVID, BUT I THINK IT MEANS SOMETHING. I HOPE IT MEANS SOMETHING GOOD. I HOPE IT MEANS YOUNG PEOPLE AND FEMALE ARE VOTING.  YOU'RE NOT A QUANTITY IN THE WAY THE CHIEF OF STAFF OR SOMETIMES THE CIA DIRECTOR DOESN'T CREATE THE INTELLIGENCE. THEY RECEIVE THE INTELLIGENCE. BUT WHEN YOU ARE A TOP FLIGHT STRATEGIST AS YOU HAVE BEEN, YOU'D GET ALL THE NUMBERS COMING IN. OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT AT A CERTAIN LEVEL, THIS IS BETTER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE, BETTER TO START COUNTING UP A LEAD THAN NOT. BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY WAY TO KNOW -- ARE THE PEOPLE JUST VOTING DIFFERENTLY NOW THAT EARLY VOTING HAS BECOME MORE NORMALIZED?  HONESTLY, ARI, I DON'T KNOW. PETER HART, A SAGE MAN TOLD ME EARLY IN MY CAREER -- I ASKED HIM, WHO DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO WIN BASED ON THE POLL? HE SAID, MY JOB IS NOT TO PREDICT ELECTIONS IT'S TO AFFECT ELECTIONS. I TOOK THAT TO HEART. THEY'VE GOT 20 PEOPLE IN THE PREDICTION INDUSTRY. I'M TELLING PEOPLE, THEY'RE GOING TO SHUT THE GOVERNMENT DOWN TO CUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. YOU BETTER GO OUT AND VOTE. THEY TOLD YOU THEY WOULD BAN ABORTION. YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE THEM. THEY DID. YOU BETTER PAY ATTENTION. SO I'M GOING TO BE SWINGING TO AFFECT THIS VOTE, TO GET PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE RIGHT TILL THE LAST MINUTE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THESE MEAN, BUT THEY CAN'T MEAN ANYTHING BAD.  NOT BAD. LET'S TAKE IT TO GEORGIA WHERE THOSE ISSUES ARE ON THE TABLE. YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE WOMEN'S RIGHTS OR -- IN GEORGIA, AT THE CENTER OF THE TRUMP CRIMINAL PROBE ON SOME PEOPLE'S MIND THERE IS. THEN YOU HAVE HERSCHEL WALKER, EARLY VOTE DEMOCRATS ARE SURGING IN THE EARLY VOTE. HERSCHEL HAS A MARIE ANTOINETTE HYPOCRISY GOING HERE. HE WANTS TO CONTROL YOUR LIFE -- I SAY THIS AS A POLICY ANALYSIS. I SAY THIS AS A FACT. HIS POLICY IS HE GETS TO DO THINGS YOU DON'T. HE WILL MAKE MEDICAL DECISIONS THROUGH THE LAW FOR YOU, YOUR FAMILY, YOUR DOCTOR, AND THEN HE'LL DO WHATEVER THE HECK HE WANTS ANY WAY. IS THAT HURTING HIM IN GEORGIA ARE DEMOCRATS SEEM TO BE SURGING?  I'M A PROUD FAN OF S.E.C. FOOTBALL. HERSCHEL WALKER AND TOMMY TUBBERVILLE ARE AN EMBARRASSMENT TO THE SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE. THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT GUY. NO ONE CAN BE THAT DUPLICITOUS. HE NEEDS TO HAVE A BRAIN SCAN OR SOMETHING. THAT'S JUST -- HE'S NOT RIGHT. THAT BOY -- HE'S JUST NOT RIGHT, OKAY?  ALL RIGHT. MY FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU, JAMES, AND THIS IS THE LAST ONE. YOU HAVE BEEN GENEROUS WITH YOUR TIME ON A BIG NIGHT.  SURE.  HOW WILL YOU BE WATCHING TOMORROW NIGHT? I WILL TELL YOU ONE OF THE BIGGEST MISTAKES YOU SEE IN THE PRESS SOMETIMES IS RUSHING, RUSHING, RUSHING. LET'S GET THE FACTS AND SEE WHERE THEY LAND. HOW WILL YOU BE WATCHING THE NUMBERS AS THEY COME IN?  I'LL ACTUALLY BE ON MSNBC --  I HEARD ABOUT THAT.  I PAY ATTENTION TO STEVE KORNACKI. I LOVE STEVE, BECAUSE I LOVE -- I'LL ASK HIM ABOUT FLIGHT LINE TOMORROW. BUT AT ANY RATE, I'M GOING TO LOOK AT MAINE, TOO. I'M GOING LOOK AT VIRGINIA TWO, VIRGINIA SEVEN EARLY. SHOULD BE GETTING STUFF OVER THE TRANSOM IN NORTH CAROLINA. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO KNOW THE DIRECTION OF THIS ELECTION BY 10:30 EASTERN. IF THE SENATE IS 50/50, WE COULD -- IT MIGHT TAKE A WEEK, BUT WE WILL KNOW -- WE'LL HAVE A GOOD IDEA, AND I'M GOING TO WAIT FOR BROTHER KORNACKI, BECAUSE WHATEVER HE SAYS FOR ME TO THINK, THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING THINK ON ELECTION NIGHT.  YOU KNOW THE SAYING ABOUT BROTHER KORNACKI ON ELECTION NIGHT, EVERYBODY SAYS IN THESE HALLS, HE DOESN'T COUNT THE HEY UNTIL IT'S ALL IN THE BARN.  I'M GOING GET YOU A RULE ONE DAY, I GUARANTEE UP. YOU.  JAMES, WE WILL SEE YOU TOMORROW NIGHT. WE'LL KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS WE DISCUSSED. APPRECIATE YOUR TIME. ONE OF THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS.  APPRECIATE YOU, ARI. ALWAYS GOOD BEING ON.  APPRECIATE THE RAGIN' CAJUN. > BEFORE THE HOUR'S THROUGH, THE NANNY, FRAN DRESCHER IS HERE AS WE LOOK AT HOW CELEBRITIES ARE PART OF THIS. > PLUS, PLANS TO SLASH THE SAFETY NET? OBAMA SPEAKING OUT. IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT, BENEFITS, INFLATION, YOU MIGHT WANT AN ECONOMIST AROUND. WE ACTUALLY DO FACTS AND POLICY AROUND HERE. PAUL KRUGMAN IS HERE WITH US ON ELECTION EVE NEXT.

        "trs": "> WHAT I FEAR IN THE AFTERMATH OF 2022, EVEN IN THE BEST CASE SCENARIO WHERE WE HAVE PEACE AND WE HAVE VOTING, IS WILL KEVIN McCARTHY DENOUNCE THE CANDIDATES WHO DENY THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION? WILL MITCH McCONNELL TELL REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATES TO CONCEDE RATHER THAN PERPETUATING FALSE NARRATIVES? I DOUBT IT. THE RNC IS NOT DENOUNCING WHAT THE PILLOW SALESMEN ARE SAYING, WHAT THE STEVE BANNONS ARE SAYING, WHAT THE KARI LAKES ARE SAYING. THEY ARE EMBRACING IT. SO IT'S MORE THAN COMPLICIT. THEY ARE PART OF IT.  IT WAS HAUNTING WHEN HE FIRST SAID IT FRIDAY. ALL THE MORE HAUNTING NOW ONE DAY BEFORE ELECTION DAY. HI AGAIN, EVERYBODY. IT'S 5:00 IN NEW YORK. ON FRIDAY AT THIS HOUR VOTING RIGHTS ATTORNEY MARC ELIAS SAID THAT, TOLD US ABOUT HIS CONCERNS FOR THESE CRITICAL MIDTERM ELECTIONS, NOW JUST ONE DAY AWAY. HOW DONALD TRUMP IS NO LONGER JUST THE SORE LOSER HE WAS IN 2020 WITH HIS RAGTAG TEAM OF QUASI-LAWYERS SPOUTING FALSEHOODS ABOUT THE ELECTION ON TV AND IN COURT. HE'S NOW GOT THE WEIGHT OF ONE OF OUR MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES AND MANY PEOPLE OUT IN THE STATES BEHIND HIM. AS THE GOP HAS DEMONSTRATED FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS, IT'S MORE THAN COMPLICITY, AS MARC SAID TO US, TO THE EX-PRESIDENT'S UNSUBSTANTIATED AND COMPLETELY DEBUNKED CLAIMS ABOUT ELECTION FRAUD. THERE'S NEW REPORTING IN THE \"WASHINGTON POST\" THAT SHOWS HOW REPUBLICAN OFFICIALS IN BATTLEGROUND STATES HAVE TAKEN TO THE COURTS TO GO AFTER ONE OF TRUMP'S BIGGEST TARGETS. THAT'S THE MAIL-IN VOTE. THE \"POST\" REPORTS THIS. \"IN PENNSYLVANIA THE STATE SUPREME COURT HAS AGREED WITH THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE THAT ELECTION OFFICIALS SHOULD NOT COUNT BALLOTS ON WHICH THE VOTER NEGLECTED TO PUT A DATE ON THE OUTER ENVELOPE EVEN IN CASES WHEN THE BALLOTS ARRIVE BEFORE ELECTION DAY. THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS HAVE BEEN SET ASIDE AS A RESULT, ENOUGH TO SWING A CLOSE RACE.\" IN MICHIGAN CHRISTINA KARAMO, THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR SECRETARY OF STATE, SUED THE TOP ELECTION OFFICIAL IN DETROIT LAST MONTH, SEEKING TO TOSS ABSENTEE BALLOTS NOT CAST IN PERSON WITH AN I.D., EVEN THOUGH THAT RUNS CONTRARY TO THAT STATE'S REQUIREMENTS. A JUDGE DISMISSED THAT CASE EARLIER TODAY. AND IN WISCONSIN REPUBLICANS WON A COURT RULING THAT WILL PREVENT SOME MAIL BALLOTS FROM BEING COUNTED WHEN THE REQUIRED WITNESS ADDRESS IS NOT COMPLETE. \"WASHINGTON POST\" PUTS THESE MOVES INTO PERSPECTIVE FOR US. \"WHILE THE REJECTIONS MAY HAVE SOME BASIS IN STATE LAW, EXPERTS SAY THEY APPEAR TO GO AGAINST A PRINCIPLE ENSHRINED IN FEDERAL LAW OF NOT DISENFRANCHISING VOTERS FOR MINOR ERRORS. CRITICS ARGUE THAT THE OVERALL PURPOSE IS TO SEPARATE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS BY METHOD OF VOTING AND THEN TO USE LAWSUITS TO VOID MAIL BALLOTS THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY DEMOCRATIC.\" WE'LL HEAD OVER TO GEORGIA. THERE'S ANOTHER BATTLE THERE OVER MAIL-IN BALLOTS. IT'S BEEN BREWING FOR A WHILE. THE ACLU FILED A LAWSUIT YESTERDAY AFTER LEARNING APPROXIMATELY 1,000 ABSENTEE BALLOTS IN COBB COUNTY WERE NEVER MAILED OUT. THEY SAY GEORGIA'S NEW VOTING LAW IS TO BLAME SINCE IT SHORTENS THE PERIOD OF TIME THE COUNTY CAN MAIL OUT AN ABSENTEE BALLOT. HERE'S WHAT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ACLU OF GEORGIA ANDREA YOUNG TOLD MY COLLEAGUE BLAYNE ALEXANDER TODAY.  IN 2020 A MILLION AND A HALF PEOPLE IN GEORGIA VOTED BY MAIL. THE GOVERNOR AND I VOTED THE SAME. WE VOTED BY MAIL. WE TOOK OUR MAIL -- WE TOOK OUR BALLOTS TO AN OUTDOOR DROP BOX. THIS PROCESS WORKED FLAWLESLY. THE BALLOTS WERE AUDITED. WE HAD NUMEROUS RECOUNTS IN GEORGIA. THERE WAS NO REASON TO CHANGE THE PROCESS. BUT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR CAME IN, SLASHED THE DAYS TO PROCESS MAIL-IN BALLOTS, AND AS A RESULT WE SEE THAT A MILLION FEWER MAIL-IN BALLOTS HAVE BEEN CAST IN THIS ELECTION.  AND JUST THIS AFTERNOON IN RESPONSE TO THIS LAWSUIT COBB COUNTY HAS AGREED TO EXTEND THE ABSENTEE BALLOT DEADLINE TO NOVEMBER 14th. THIS IS WHERE WE BEGIN THE HOUR, WITH VOTING RIGHTS ATTORNEY AND FOUNDER OF THE DEMOCRACY DOCKET MARC ELIAS. I KNOW IT'S A VERY BUSY DAY, IT'S A VERY BUSY WEEK. THANK YOU FOR MAKING TIME FOR US.  HAPPY TO BE HERE.  TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING. WE TICK THROUGH SOME OF THESE, BUT TELL ME WHAT IS SORT OF FLASHING RED FOR YOU TODAY.  YEAH, I THINK YOU'VE REALLY CAPTURED IT WELL. YOU KNOW, DEMOCRACY DOCKET, WHICH TRACKS ALL OF THIS LITIGATION, JUST BEFORE I CAME ON I CHECKED. THERE ARE 128 LAWSUITS THAT HAVE BEEN FILED SO FAR THIS YEAR ACROSS 35 STATES. 82 OF THEM ARE ACTIVE. AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DAY I TWEETED OUT THAT WE WERE GOING TO SEE DECISIONS IN 11 CASES. WE HAVE SIX DECISIONS SO FAR TODAY INCLUDING THE TWO YOU MENTIONED IN MICHIGAN, WHICH WAS A VICTORY FOR VOTERS THERE. THE ACLU CASE IN GEORGIA WAS A VICTORY. WE SAW VICTORIES IN PENNSYLVANIA. WE SAW VICTORIES IN NEW YORK. THERE ARE IMAGES ONLINE, IF YOU GO LOOK, THERE ARE VOTING MACHINES LITERALLY BEING WHEELED IN TO VASSAR COLLEGE TODAY AS A RESULT OF A COURT VICTORY THERE. REPUBLICANS ARE 0 FOR 6 TODAY AND DEMOCRACY IS 6-0. SO WE'VE STILL GOT FIVE MORE CASES THAT I EXPECT TO COME IN BUT I'M FEELING GOOD ABOUT HOW THE COURTS ARE HANDLING IT.  MARC, IS THE LITIGATION STRATEGY TO DISENFRANCHISE VOTERS STRAIGHT UP, OR IS IT TO DISENFRANCHISE VOTERS IF YOU WIN AND TO CAST DOUBT AND ASPERSION ON THE RESULT IF YOU LOSE? IS IT BOTH OR --  OH, IT'S THE SECOND. I THINK IT MAY BE MORE OF THE SECOND PART OF THE SECOND THAN EVEN THE FIRST PART OF THE SECOND. I THINK THAT MUCH OF HAD LITIGATION -- TAKE THE LAWSUIT, FOR EXAMPLE, IN WISCONSIN. A CONSERVATIVE GROUP BROUGHT A LAWSUIT TO THROW OUT ALL OF -- OR TO NOT COUNT ALL OF THE BALLOTS CAST BY OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM SERVING OVERSEAS. I MEAN, THAT'S JUST OBSCENE. AND IT'S ALSO NOT GOING TO PREVAIL. YOU KNOW. ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENT WE ARE INTERVENING IN THAT LAWSUIT TO DEFEND THOSE VOTERS. BUT THAT'S GOING TO WIND UP FAILING. BUT WHY BRING THAT LAWSUIT? WHY ARE REPUBLICANS BRINGING SO MANY OF THESE CASES TO TRY TO DISENFRANCHISE VOTERS? IT'S NOT BECAUSE I THINK THEY THINK THEY'RE GOING TO WIN BUT IT'S BECAUSE IT GIVES THEM GRIEVANCE. IT GIVES THEM GRIEVANCE WHEN THEY LOSE. AND IF THERE'S ONE THING WE KNOW ABOUT TRUMP AND THE MAGA MOVEMENT, IT LOVES GRIEVANCE MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.  MARC, I WONDER SOMETIMES -- AND I SAID THIS ABOUT THE VOTER INTIMIDATION, YOU KNOW, INVESTIGATIONS AND REFERRALS TO DOJ. THE SPECTER OF FEAR IS THE POINT. AND SO I HAVE A LOT OF SQUEAMISHNESS WHEN WE SIT AROUND IN THE MORNING AND DECIDE WHETHER TO COVER, YOU KNOW, THESE GOOBERS IN CAMO OUTFITS WITH THEIR GUNS AND VIDEO CAMERAS. PEOPLE WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT THEY'RE THERE. BUT IT'S ALSO AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT IN AMERICAN DEMOCRACY THAT YOU HAVE TO FEEL -- TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE AND UNEASY GOING IN TO DROP OFF YOUR BALLOT IS THEIR POINT. AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS AROUND THESE LAWSUITS IF IT'S NOT THE POINT FOR THEM TO PREVAIL BUT THE POINT TO KEEP YOU RUNNING AROUND FIGHTING ALL OF THEIR FRIVOLOUS LITIGATION WHAT ARE THEY SO AFRAID OF IF YOU WEREN'T HAVING TO DEFEND AGAINST THEIR ATTACKS ON VOTING?  I THINK THEY'RE AFRAID THAT IF EVERYONE WAS ABLE TO VOTE AND THEY'D GET AN ACCURATE COUNT THEY'D LOSE. IT'S NOTHING MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT. THEY KNOW IF EVERY ELIGIBLE VOTER WAS ALLOWED TO CAST A BALLOT AND THAT IT WAS COUNTED ACCURATELY THEY'D LOSE. THAT HAS BEEN THE WHOLE THREAT TO TRUMPISM FROM THE BEGINNING. LET'S NOT FORGET, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE SAY DONALD TRUMP WON IN 2016. HE LOST BY 3 MILLION POPULAR VOTE. THAT POPULAR VOTE TOTAL DEFICIT GREW IN 2020. SO THEY HAVE TO FIND INCREASINGLY CREATIVE WAYS TO PREVENT THE MAJORITY WILL FROM WILLING OUT. AND ONE OF THE WAYS YOU DO IT IS YOU SUPPRESS THE VOTE. BUT I THINK THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THEY LEARNED IS THAT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH AND THEY NEED TO AFFECT THE WAY VOTES ARE COUNTED AND ELECTIONS ARE CERTIFIED. AND NICOLLE, IF THERE'S ONE THING I WORRY ABOUT IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS IS WE'RE NOW GOING TO GET INTO VOTE COUNTING AND CERTIFICATION SEASON AND I THINK WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE LAST OF THE BAG OF TRICKS THAT REPUBLICANS WILL HAVE.  WILL YOU JUST SORT OF TAKE US TO SCHOOL ON THIS? I THINK WE ALL GOT A REEDUCATION IN THE RED MIRAGE IN THE PUBLIC HEARINGS OF THE JANUARY 6th SELECT COMMITTEE WHEN ALL OF TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN AIDES TESTIFIED UNDER OATH TO THE FACT THEIR STRATEGY WAS TO POINT TO WHAT THEY KNEW WAS A MIRAGE, IN OTHER WORDS, NOT REAL, THIS PILEUP OF VOTES ON THE SAME DAY THAT THEY KNEW WOULD GO DOWN. THEY SEEMED TO SUGGEST IN THEIR SWORN TESTIMONY THAT EVEN TRUMP WAS TOLD THAT WOULD BE A MIRAGE. IT'S NOT CLEAR IF HE KNEW WHAT MIRAGE WENT. BUT IT SEEMS THAT REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURES HAVE KEPT SOME OF THE WAY THAT WE COUNT THE VOTE IN PLACE. JUST EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS AND WHAT ELECTION NIGHT COULD LOOK LIKE.  SURE. SO LOOK, WE'RE NOT GOING TO KNOW THE OUTCOME IN A NUMBER OF THE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES ON ELECTION NIGHT BECAUSE STATES ARE RECEIVING NOT JUST ELECTION DAY VOTES, PEOPLE WHO VOTED ON ELECTION DAY, BUT ALSO PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE VOTED EARLY IN PERSON, WHERE THOSE HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY TABULATED, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S THE PEOPLE WHO VOTE BY MAIL. AND THOSE MAIL-IN VOTES TAKE LONGER TO TALLY BECAUSE THERE ARE, NICOLLE -- AND THIS IS ONE OF THE PERVERSE THINGS ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN ARGUMENT. VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS ARE THE BALLOTS MOST SUBJECTED TO THE GREATEST SCRUTINY. THEY ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE REJECTED FOR TECHNICALITY. SO THAT PROCESS OF SCRUTINIZING THEM AND FRANKLY REJECTING THEM TAKES MORE TIME. THEY ARE THE BALLOTS THAT TAKE THE LONGEST TO COUNT. AND OF COURSE THOSE BALLOTS ARE INCREASINGLY MORE LIKELY TO BE OF DEMOCRATS. SO AS THOSE BALLOTS ARE TALLIED YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE AND MORE DEMOCRATIC VOTES COME IN AND THEIR VOTE SHARE INCREASE. I JUST A VIDEO SOMEONE TWEETED OUT AT ME OF STEVE BANNON TALKING TO DOUG MASTRIANO TODAY AND THEY WERE REPEATING THE BIG LIE. AND MASTRIANO WAS LIKE, WE CAN SEND A MAN TO THE MOON, WHY CAN'T WE TALLY -- WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TALLY ALL THE VOTES ON ELECTION DAY. AND WE SHOULDN'T COUNT ANYTHING AFTER ELECTION DAY. WELL, THE REASON WE CAN'T COUNT THEM ALL BY ELECTION DAY, DOUG MASTRIANO, IS BECAUSE THE REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE DOESN'T ALLOW THE PREPROCESSING OF THOSE BALLOTS UNTIL 7:00 A.M. ON ELECTION DAY. SO IT'S REALLY TERRIBLE WHAT WE'RE SEEING.  YOU KNOW, THIS IS GOING TO DATE ME, BUT REPUBLICANS USED TO VOTE BY MAIL MORE THAN -- KARL ROVE ASCENDED IN REPUBLICAN POLITICS IN PART FROM DIRECT MAIL AND MAIL VOTING. IF YOU WERE TO OFFER ADVICE, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE DEMOCRATIC VOTE SPREAD OUT MORE AMONG MAIL, ABSENTEE AND SAME DAY? WOULD THAT HELP? OR IS THAT NOT THE POINT IN A DEMOCRACY?  LOOK, IT'S NOT THE POINT. I MEAN, YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT, BY THE WAY. AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO DATE BACK VERY FAR. REPUBLICANS HISTORICALLY VOTED MORE BY MAIL. UNTIL 2020. YOU KNOW, UNTIL THE PANDEMIC. THAT WAS THEIR PREFERRED METHOD OF VOTING. AND IT WAS ONLY IN 2020 THAT REPUBLICANS CHANGED BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP ONE DAY DECIDED TO WAKE UP AND TWEET THAT HE DIDN'T LIKE MAIL-IN VOTING. AND ALL THESE REPUBLICAN CONSULTANTS WENT SCURRYING BACK TO SAY YEAH, YEAH, YEAH, WE NO LONGER LIKE MAIL-IN VOTING. BUT THE TRUTH IS THE REASON WE HAVE MAIL-IN VOTING AND EARLY VOTING AND SAME-DAY VOTING IS FOR DIFFERENT VOTERS ONE METHOD OR THE OTHER WORKS BETTER FOR THEM. THEY'RE ALL SECURE. THEY ALL GET THE BALLOT DELIVERED AND READY TO BE COUNTED. AND THERE'S NO REASON TO TARGET ONE OVER THE OTHER AS SOMEHOW MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN THE OTHER. IF ANYTHING, LIKE I SAID, MAIL-IN VOTING TENDS TO BE THE BALLOTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE GREATEST SCRUTINY. SO ARE THE LEAST, YOU KNOW, PROBLEMATIC. BUT YET THAT'S WHERE REPUBLICANS HAVE DECIDED TO VILLAINIZE MAIL-IN VOTING.  I THINK IT'S THE GEORGIA VOTER SUPPRESSION LAW TAKES AWAY DROP BOXES AND I THINK THE TEXAS LAW DOES TOO. AND THE BALLOTS THAT HAVE TO BE PREPARED AND DROPPED OFF IN DROP BOX IZZ THINK RUN OF THOSE STATES REQUIRES YOU TO SHOW A LICENSE WHEN YOU TURN IT IN. THEY ALL REQUIRE ATTESTATIONS. THEY HAVE TARGETED THE MOST SECURITY KINDS OF VOTING. I GUESS TO YOUR POINT THAT THE VOTER SUPPRESSION IS THE POINT.  YEAH. SO THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT. IT'S LIKE REALLY IMPORTANT, NICOLLE, AND I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH. ONE OF THE POINTS THAT I CONSTANTLY HEAR FROM REPUBLICANS AND CONSERVATIVES IS MARC, HOW COME YOU DON'T LIKE ANY BALLOT SECURITY MEASURES? WHY ARE YOU AGAINST ALL SECURITY AND ELECTION INTEGRITY MEASURES? YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIGGEST ADVANCEMENT IN ELECTION INTEGRITY SECURITY MEASURES WAS? DROP BOXES. DROP BOXES WERE CREATED BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE AFRAID THAT BALLOTS MIGHT BE STOLEN OUT OF THE MAIL SYSTEM. PEOPLE COMPLETE THEIR BALLOT AND THEY PUT IT IN THEIR ENVELOPE, THEIR MAILBOX AT THE END OF THE STREET OR THEY GO THROUGH THE POSTAL SERVICE. SO SOMEONE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF METAL CONTAINERS THAT ARE SECURE THAT ARE PICKED UP BY THE ELECTION OFFICIAL. SO THE IDEA THAT THEY ARE NOW BEING TARGETED BY REPUBLICANS, THEY ARE LITERALLY TARGETING ONE OF THE MOST SECURE METHODS OF VOTING.  I WOULD SAY IT'S SHOCKING BUT I THINK WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO BE SHOCKED ANYMORE.  YOU KNOW WHY.  WE KNOW WHY. IT'S VERY MUCH ON BRAND. MARC, I HAVE A SENSE OF HOW BUSY YOU ARE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M GOING TO WARN YOU AHEAD OF TIME WE WILL CONTINUE TO CALL ON YOU THIS WEEK.  AND I'LL BE BACK.  THANK YOU SO MUCH. JOINING OUR CONVERSATION, EDITOR AT LARGE OF THE BULWARK CHARLIE SYKES IS BACK. ALSO JOINING US FORMER MARYLAND CONGRESSWOMAN DONNA EVERS IS HERE. AND \"NEW YORK TIMES\" EDITORIAL BOARD MEMBER MARA GAY IS HERE. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR? I DON'T LIKE PREDICTIONS BUT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE WATCHING?  WELL, AFTER THAT CONVERSATION WITH MARC --  IT'S SO DARK.  IT'S DARK. BUT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I'LL HAVE FOR HIM IN THE DAYS AHEAD IS WHERE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING. WE'VE BEEN DELUGED OVER THE PAST YEAR OR TWO BY STORIES ABOUT PARTISAN ELECTION OFFICIALS TAKING OVER THE MACHINERY OF ELECTION COUNTING, BALLOT COUNTING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. SO I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. BUT ULTIMATELY TOMORROW IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF TURNOUT. WHO HAS VOTED EARLY AND WHO SHOWS UP TOMORROW. I THINK NO MATTER WHAT YOUR PARTISAN AFFILIATION IS I REALLY HOPE AMERICANS GO OUT AND VOTE AND LET THEIR VOICE BE HEARD AND ARE NOT INTIMIDATED BY SOME OF THESE MEASURES MEANT TO KEEP THEM HOME, WHICH IS REALLY SHAMEFUL.  YOU KNOW, CHARLIE, SOMETHING I KEEP THINKING ABOUT IS WE HAVEN'T HAD AN ELECTION IN SORT OF POST-COVID AMERICA. SO THE SAME-DAY TURNOUT, WHAT DO WE LOOK BACK? DO WE LOOK BACK TO '18? WHAT ARE YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW?  WELL, I'M REALLY STRUCK BY HOW MUCH WE DON'T KNOW THAT WE DON'T KNOW.  RIGHT.  AND THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE OF THE QUESTIONS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUND GAMES OF THE PARTIES THIS YEAR AS OPPOSED TO TWO YEARS AND FOUR YEARS AGO. WHAT ARE THE POLLS MISSING? WHAT ARE THEY PICKING UP? WHAT IS THIS CAMPAIGN OF FEAR AND GRIEVANCE THAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT? I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY YOUR CONVERSATION BECAUSE I THINK PEOPLE DO NEED TO STRAP IN THAT THIS IS NOT JUST GOING TO BE A ONE-DAY AFFAIR, THAT THE OVERTIME IS GOING TO BE EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE WE'VE SPENT THE LAST TWO YEARS WITH REPUBLICANS GINNING UP AND CREATING THIS MACHINERY FOR ELECTION DENIAL. AND MUCH OF THE REPUBLICAN BASE HAS NOW BEEN -- HAS MARINATED IN THIS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS AND NOW EXPECTS THE CHALLENGES THAT USED TO BE ONE-OFFS. I WILL TELL YOU I LIVED IN WISCONSIN AND IN THE PAST I HAVE VOTED ABSENTEE OR I VOTED EARLY. I DIDN'T DO THAT THIS YEAR BECAUSE I AM WATCHING THE LEGAL CHALLENGES, I DO NOT WANT MY VOTE TO BE DISQUALIFIED OR SUPPRESSED BECAUSE I LEAVE OFF A DATE OR A DIGIT ON MY ADDRESS. AND I DO THINK THAT IF THE ELECTION IS CLOSE HERE THERE IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR EFFORT HERE IN WISCONSIN TO DISENFRANCHISE MY FELLOW CITIZENS. AND I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT. AND I WONDER HOW MANY OTHER VOTERS ARE FEELING THE SAME WAY. BECAUSE I THINK RIGHT NOW WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HOW DEEPLY -- YOU KNOW, HOW DEEPLY IMMERSED THE REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT HAS NOW BEEN IN ELECTION DENIALISM, DOES ANYONE THINK THAT THEY WILL NOT APPLY THIS TO CLOSE ELECTIONS IN GEORGIA, PENNSYLVANIA, ARIZONA AND WISCONSIN OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS? SO YOU KNOW, REALLY STRAP IN. WE MAY BE ABOUT TO EXPERIENCE SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN IN A MIDTERM.  CHARLIE, I AM VOTING IN PERSON TOMORROW FOR THE FIRST TIME IN I DON'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME I WENT AND VOTED IN PERSON. I WAS USUALLY WORKING WHEN I WAS ON CAMPAIGNS AND I'M WORKING NOW. BUT I'M DOING THE SAME THING. I CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN MY REASONS. ESPECIALLY IN NEW YORK I DON'T HAVE THOSE WORRIES ABOUT BEING DISENFRANCHISED. BUT I HAVE THE SAME FEELING THAT I WANT TO DEFY THE REPUBLICAN MACHINERY AND I WANT SORT OF A TRUE COUNT MAYBE ON ELECTION DAY. AND I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU ONE MORE QUESTION. I THINK THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN 2000 WAS THIS EARTHQUAKE, RIGHT? TRUMP SOWED DOUBT ABOUT THE ELECTION WE KNOW FROM THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE THAT HE WAS WORKING WITH TOM FITTON ON INVALIDATING THE ELECTION SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE HE LOST IT. THE TRUTH IS OUR DEMOCRACY IS IN WORSE SHAPE NOW. I MEAN, 48 STATES PASSED VOTER INTEGRITY LAWS AFTER THE COURTS, MANY OF THEM LED BY TRUMP-APPOINTED JUDGES, FOUND ZERO FRAUD. THE DEMOCRACY'S IN WORSE SHAPE NOW THAN IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO. DO YOU THINK THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE TOO BLEAK? DO YOU THINK THEY ARE NOT BLEAK ENOUGH FOR WHAT COULD HAPPEN TOMORROW?  I THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE A HIGH LEVEL OF CONCERN BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE'LL BE TAKEN BY SURPRISE. SO I THINK IT IS LEGITIMATE TO BE ALARMED. LOOK, THE WINDOW OF WHAT IS ACCEPTABLE HAS SHIFTED. SO AGAIN, IN MY HOME STATE OF WISCONSIN THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE STATE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE ACTUALLY IS PUSHING TO INVALIDATE ALL MILITARY BALLOTS. I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT THAT FOR THE MOMENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND GO BUZZ OFF. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY INCONCEIABLE EVEN A FEW YEARS AGO THAT SOMEONE WOULD BE OPENLY TALKING ABOUT DISENFRANCHISING LARGE NUMBERS OF SERVING VOTERS. AND YET THIS IS THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. SO WE DON'T KNOW -- JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW, IF WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION THE DAY BEFORE THE 2020 ELECTION AND YOU ASKED ME THAT SAME QUESTION, I WOULD SAY YEAH, WE OUGHT TO BE VERY, VERY CONCERNED. AND YET EVEN THEN WE HAD NO IDEA THE LENGTHS THEY WOULD GO POST-ELECTION. AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO HAVE THAT SAME LEVEL OF VIGILANCE THIS TIME.  YOU KNOW, AND DONNA, THE OTHER THING THAT'S UNDENIABLE IS YOU COULD ARGUE, I SUPPOSE, IF YOU'RE MITCH McCONNELL OR KEVIN McCARTHY THAT THE DECISION TO HUMOR TRUMP AND LET HIM LICK HIS WOUNDS BY NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN WAS THE PRESIDENT-ELECT ON NOVEMBER WHATEVER IT WAS, 4th OR 5th, YOU COULD ARGUE I GUESS THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT THERE WOULD BE A DEADLY INSURRECTION AT THEIR PLACE OF BUSINESS, THAT FIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS WOULD LOSE THEIR LIVES, THAT HUNDREDS WOULD BE TRAUMATIZED FROM ENGAGING IN WHAT THEY DESCRIBED AS MEDIEVAL HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT. BUT WE KNOW NOW. WE KNOW BETTER. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY OUT THERE SAYING THEY WILL NOT ACCEPT THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION IF THEY DON'T WIN?  WELL, I MEAN, LOOK, I THINK WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS TRUE, BUT YOU KNOW, THE FACT IS THAT THERE ARE ALREADY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ALREADY CAST THEIR BALLOTS, THAT IN MANY OF THESE STATES WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DECIDE, THAT ONE ELECTION WAS WRONGLY DECIDED BUT THE REST OF THE RACES THAT ARE ON THE BALLOT WERE NOT? AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE GETTING SMARTER ABOUT THIS. BUT I DO WORRY THAT BECAUSE OF THE ENDLESS LITIGATION, BECAUSE OF THE THREATS AT THE POLLS, THAT THAT HAS ITS OWN WAY OF POTENTIALLY SUPPRESSING THE VOTE. SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR VOTERS TO BE PATIENT ABOUT THE OUTCOME. WE ALREADY KNOW THAT IN SOME STATES BECAUSE THERE'S A DELAY IN COUNTING MAIL-IN BALLOTS THAT THAT COULD TAKE SOME TIME TO DECIDE SOME OF THESE RACES THAT ARE GOING TO BE VERY, VERY CLOSE. AND AGAIN, I THINK THE WATCH WORD FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS IT WAS IN 2020 IS TO BE PATIENT AND ALLOW DEMOCRACY TO WORK, ALLOW THE PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD. AND THEN WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE THE ELECTION DENIERS. BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE NOT JUST DENYING A NATIONAL ELECTION, THEY'RE DENYING ELECTIONSED UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT. YOU KNOW, AS THE PRESIDENT HAS SAID, THIS REALLY IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY, AND MAYBE THAT WILL MOVE SOME VOTERS. BUT THE KEY HERE IS GOING TO BE PATIENCE THROUGH THE WEEK. AND IN SOME CASES, MAYBE EVEN INTO NEXT WEEK AND BEYOND, TO DECIDE THIS ELECTION. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THOSE VOTES ARE INVALID.  ALL RIGHT. NO ONE IS GOING ANYWHERE TODAY. WHEN WE COME BACK, IN THE FIGHT TO DEFEAT ELECTION DENIERS ANOTHER DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE IN A TOUGH RACE HAS WON THE ENDORSEMENT OF REPUBLICAN CONGRESSWOMAN LIZ CHENEY. THAT DEMOCRATIC MEMBER, U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN ABIGAIL SPANBERGER OF VIRGINIA, WILL BE OUR NEXT GUEST. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. PLUS A HARD-HITTING NEW AD FROM SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK IN GEORGIA AIMING TO WIN OVER REPUBLICANS WHO AREN'T QUITE COMFORTABLE WITH HERSCHEL WALKER'S PERSONAL HISTORY. WE'LL GET THE LATEST ON THE RACE THAT COULD DETERMINE CONTROL OF THE U.S. SENATE. PLUS, THERE ARE FIVE STATES WHERE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS ARE LITERALLY ON THE BALLOT TOMORROW. AND PERHAPS NONE MORE CRUCIALLY THAN MICHIGAN. WHERE AN UP OR DOWN VOTE COULD CHANGE THE LEGAL STATUS OF ABORTION MOVING FORWARD. \"DEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE\" CONTINUES AFTER A QUICK BREAK. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. E. 20221107222243.524|20221107222445.746",

SPECIFICALLY THE RACE FOR U.S. HOUSE. IT IS CONSIDERED A HIGH-STAKES BELLWETHER CONTEST. CONGRESSWOMAN ABIGAIL SPANBERGER TAKING ON TRUMP-ENDORSED YESLI HAVINGA. SPANBERGER ACTUALLY PICKED UP AN ENDORSEMENT OVER THE WEEKEND FROM REPUBLICAN CONGRESSWOMAN LIZ CHENEY. HERE'S WHAT THE VICE CHAIR OF THE JANUARY 6th COMMITTEE SAID TO NBC WASHINGTON.  WE'RE AT A MOMENT WHERE WE CANNOT AFFORD TO ELECT PEOPLE INTO OFFICE WHO EXCUSE IN ANY WAY WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SAYING ABOUT THE LAST ELECTIONS, PEOPLE WHO SUGGEST, AS ABIGAIL'S OPPONENT HAS, THAT SOMEHOW JANUARY 6th WAS JUST THE EXERCISE OF FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.  DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN ABIGAIL SPANBERGER OF VIRGINIA JOINS US RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I KNOW THESE DAYS ARE PRETTY FRAINGT AND BUSY, SO THANKS FOR MAKING TIME FOR US.  THANKS FOR HAVING ME.  LET'S START WITH THAT ENDORSEMENT. FIRST, ARE YOU HAPPY TO HAVE IT? AND HOW DO YOU SORT OF DEPLOY THAT IN THESE FINAL 24 HOURS?  I'M ABSOLUTELY HAPPY TO HAVE CONGRESSWOMAN CHENEY'S ENDORSEMENT. PARTICULARLY AT THESE TIMES OF PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DIVISION WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES, THE FACT THAT CONGRESSWOMAN CHENEY, A WOMAN WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED INCREDIBLE PRINCIPLE IN DEFENSE OF OUR CONSTITUTION, IN DEFENSE OF OUR COUNTRY, THE FACT THAT SHE WOULD DESPITE OUR POLICY DIFFERENCES, THERE'S AREAS WHERE WE AGREE AND DISAGREE, THAT SHE WOULD ENDORSE ME, RECOGNIZING MY COMMITMENT TO WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE, MY COMMITMENT TO GETTING THINGS DONE AND NOTABLY MY COMMITMENT TO DEFENSE OF DEMOCRACY, PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE CONTRAST WITH MY OPPONENT IN THIS RACE, I'M PROUD THAT SHE CHOSE TO ENDORSE AND I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT ACROSS THE DISTRICT.  AND YOU HAVE BEEN -- I PLAYED IN THE LAST HOUR FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA'S CLOSING ARGUMENT AROUND DEMOCRACY. IT IS THESE THEMES OF APOLITICAL PRIORITIES OF THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AND HOMELAND SECURITY HAVE BEEN THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT LONG BEFORE A CLOSING ARGUMENT. TELL ME WHAT YOU HEAR FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND WHAT SORT OF CONVERSATIONS YOU'RE MOST SORT OF EAGER TO HAVE AND WHICH ONES GIVE YOU SOME PAUSE.  I'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS ACROSS OUR DISTRICT WHERE I BEGIN BY SAYING WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU OR PEOPLE WILL BRING TO ME THE ISSUES THAT ARE DRIVING THEM TO THE POLLS OR THE ISSUES THAT MATTER. AND REALLY ACROSS THE BOARD IT'S DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE. I THINK WHAT IS A CLEAR THEME IS A LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY. FOR MANY THAT'S A LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE ECONOMY. HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THEIR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OR THEIR FOOD OR THEIR GAS. AND FOR SOME IT'S UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE RIGHTS AND THE VERY FREEDOMS WE HAVE AS AMERICANS. CONCERN ABOUT VOTING RIGHTS. CONCERN ABOUT ELECTIONS. AND CONCERN FRANKLY FROM MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE PREVIOUSLY OR LONG CONSIDERED THEMSELVES REPUBLICANS WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE TRAJECTORY OF THE COUNTRY, WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IN A RACE LIKE OURS MY OPPONENT HAS DEFENDED THE JANUARY 6th INSURRECTIONISTS, HAS CALLED THE FBI CORRUPT AND DEEP STATE, HAS PLEDGED TO NOT ONLY SUPPORT LEGISLATION TO FREE ANYONE IN PRISON RELATED TO JANUARY 6th BUT TO COMPENSATE THEM. AND HERE'S THE CLEAR CONTRAST. SHE'S ALSO IN SUPPORT OF A NATIONWIDE ABORTION BAN, THE GOVERNMENT DICTATING PREGNANCY TO WOMEN UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES. AND SO IN OUR DISTRICT I HEAR ABOUT ALL OF THESE ISSUES. I THINK PEOPLE WANT -- AND THIS GOES BACK A BIT TO THE CONGRESSWOMAN CHENEY ENDORSEMENT. PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THINGS GETTING DONE. THEY WANT TO SEE PRAGMATIC LEGISLAORS WHO ARE BUILDING COALITIONS AROUND POLICY THAT'S CAN MOVE OUR COUNTRY FORWARD, HELP OUR COMMUNITIES AND STRENGTHEN OUR ECONOMY.  YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS WORKING IN POLITICS ON SEPTEMBER 11th IT WAS A DIFFERENT -- IT WAS A NATIONAL ISSUE BUT IN VIRGINIA IT WAS A LOCAL STORY. AND SO MANY PEOPLE WERE AFFECTED AT THE PENTAGON. AND I WONDER IF JANUARY 6th IS THE SAME WAY. DOES THAT COME UP? DO PEOPLE FEEL LIKE POLITICAL VIOLENCE WAS RIGHT ON YOUR DOORSTEP AT THE CAPITOL BECAUSE IT WAS SO CLOSE TO THE STATE?  I THINK -- I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT IT'S LIKE IN OTHER STATES BUT IT CERTAINLY IS RELEVANT AND CLOSE TO HOME HERE IN VIRGINIA. WHEN I'VE BEEN MAKING VISITS AT EARLY VOTING STOPS, ONE DAY I SAW A CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER WHO I RECOGNIZED BECAUSE I SPEAK TO HER FREQUENTLY IN THE HALLS, AND SHE LIVES IN THE DISTRICT AND WAS VOTING. ANOTHER DAY I WAS APPROACHED BY A GENTLEMAN WHO TOLD ME HIS STORY. HE HAD BEEN A CAPITOL POLICE OFFICER UNTIL 2014, WHEN HE RETIRED AND HE SPOKE TO ME ABOUT SITTING AT HOME WATCHING THE ATTACK ON THAT CAPITOL AND HIS FEHR FOR THE PEOPLE THAT HE CARED ABOUT, THE PEOPLE HE WORKED WITH WHO WERE IN THAT BUILDING. SO I DO THINK THERE IS A BIT OF A VERY PERSONAL NATURE, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE HAVE THE VERY MEN AND WOMEN WHO FOUGHT TO PROTECT THE CAPITOL, EVERYONE IN IT, AND OUR VERY DEMOCRACY LIVE IN OR NEAR OUR DISTRICT.  CONGRESSWOMAN ABIGAIL SPANBERGER, THE STAKES ARE VERY HIGH. WE'LL ALL BE WATCHING THE RACE TOMORROW. GOOD LUCK. AND THANK YOU FOR SPENDING SOME TIME WITH US.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  THANK YOU. DONNA, SHE'S VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH THE VALUES AND PRIORITIES OF HER DISTRICT. SHE ALSO MAKES THIS CONGRESS BETTER. AND THAT IS PART OF -- THOSE TWO PIECES I THINK ARE PART AND PARCEL TO LIZ CHENEY'S ENDORSEMENT OF HER AND HER MESSAGE AROUND THAT ENDORSEMENT. HOW DO YOU -- YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF -- WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING IN HER RACE AND IN HER DISTRICT?  WELL, I HAVE TO SAY I WAS NOT SURPRISED AT ALL THAT ABIGAIL SPANBERGER WOULD BE THE KIND OF CANDIDATE THAT LIZ CHENEY WOULD ENDORSE. HER DISTRICT -- I'M IN THE WASHINGTON REGION, AND SO I HEAR THE ADS ALL THE TIME AS WELL. BUT YOU KNOW, HER DISTRICT HAS A LOT OF FEDERAL EMPLOYEES IN IT, PEOPLE WHO ARE CONNECTED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND SHE DESCRIBED PEOPLE WHO WORK AT THE CAPITOL. AND SO THE -- WHILE JANUARY 6th AND DEMOCRACY MAY NOT BE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST FOR ALL VOTERS IT'S CERTAINLY IN THAT CONSTRUCT. AND I THINK THAT MEMBERS LIKE HER REPRESENT WHAT I SAY IS THE BREADTH AND THE DEPTH OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE SAW LIZ CHENEY ENDORSE ALYSSA SLOTKIN AND ABIGAIL SPANBERGER. THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE KIND OF MEMBERS WHO REALLY STRENGTHEN OUR PARTY BECAUSE THEY HELP TO BRING US IN LINE WITH WHERE MOST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE. AND I THINK THAT SHE IS THE KIND OF MEMBER WHO AS SHE DESCRIBES WORKS ACROSS THE AISLE BECAUSE HER DISTRICT REQUIRES THAT.  RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. THE THREE OF US ARE GOING TO HEAD DOWN TO GEORGIA AFTER FITTING IN A QUICK BREAK. THE SENATE RACE IN GEORGIA OF COURSE NOTHING LESS THAN POTENTIALLY DETERMINING CONTROL OF THE U.S. SENATE. INCUMBENT DEMOCRATIC SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK IS MAKING A DIRECT APPEAL TO REPUBLICANS WITH AN UNSPARING NEW AD AGAINST HIS OPPONENT HERSCHEL WALKER. WE'LL SHOW IT TO YOU AFTER A QUICK BREAK. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. 20221107223355.945|20221107223722.836",

        "trs": "> REPUBLICANS ARE SPEAKING OUT ABOUT HERSCHEL WALKER'S HISTORY OF VIOLENCE.  HERSCHEL WALKER HASN'T EARNED MY RESPECT OR MY VOTE. AND YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER REPUBLICANS HERE IN GEORGIA. WE'RE CONFUSED. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO RIGHT NOW.  IF YOU HELD A GUN TO YOUR WIFE'S HEAD AND THREATENED TO BLOW IT OFF, YOU'RE A BAD MAN. AND GEORGIANS DESERVE BETTER.  GEORGIANS DESERVE BETTER THAN HERSCHEL WALKER. THAT IS THE BRAND NEW HARD-HITTING TV AD QUOTING REPUBLICANS FROM GEORGIA'S DEMOCRATIC SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK. IT LANDED, DEBUTED OVER THE WEEKEND. IT IS THE LATEST IN THE SORT OF WAR OF WORDS BETWEEN WARNOCK AND HIS REPUBLICAN OPPONENT HERSCHEL WALKER. IT'S A FINAL PROPOSAL BY WARNOCK'S TEAM TO WIN OVER ANY REMAINING UNDECIDED VOTERS INCLUDING FRUSTRATED GEORGIA REPUBLICANS IN A RACE, AS YOU SAW, WHERE ONE CANDIDATE IS, QUOTE, SO BAD, SO WRONG FOR THE STATE, THAT THE OTHER CAN SUCCESSFULLY ENLIST TWO REPUBLICAN STATE OFFICIALS TO CRITICIZE THEIR OWN PARTY'S CANDIDATE. IT'S HAPPENING IN PENNSYLVANIA AS WELL IN THE SHAPIRO RACE. A KIND OF UNDERREPORTED PHENOMENON. JOINING OUR CONVERSATION TIA MITCHELL \"ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION\" WASHINGTON REPORTER. TIA, I KNOW GEORGIA A LITTLE BIT. THESE REPUBLICAN ENDORSEMENTS FOR SENATOR WARNOCK COULD BE DETERMINATIVE. TELL ME HOW THIS AD LANDED.  YEAH. SO IT COULD BE DETERMINING THE OUTCOME OF THE RACE, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN GEORGIA HAVE ALREADY VOTED AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN GEORGIA WHO PLAN TO VOTE TOMORROW HAVE ALREADY MADE UP THEIR MINDS. SO THE QUESTION IS CAN THIS AD SWAY REPUBLICANS WHO ARE ON THE FENCE TO EITHER VOTE FOR WARNOCK OR PERHAPS LEAVE THAT RACE BLANK OR VOTE FOR THE LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE? SO I THINK THE AD FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IS LANDING EXACTLY WHERE THEY ALREADY ARE WHICH MEANS FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY SKEPTICAL OF WALKER OR WERE ALREADY SAYING HE'S NOT THE RIGHT PERSON TO REPRESENT ME IN THE SENATE, IT'S REINFORCING THAT. BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF REPUBLICANS WHO WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO WHO HAVE SAID THE ALLEGATIONS ARE NOT SWAYING THEIR VOTE, THEY BELIEVE WALKER WHEN HE SAYS IT'S ALL LIES, AND SO TWO MORE REPUBLICANS SAYING WALKER'S A BAD GUY IS NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS. HE'S THEIR CANDIDATE AND THEY ARE STICKING WITH HIM BECAUSE THEY WANT TO FLIP THE SENATE.  AND I GUESS PROBABLY A LOT OF THE VOTE IS MADE UP. BUT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW. IF YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO ON THIS LINE, THAT WAS THE INCUMBENT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR.  RIGHT.  DUNCAN. YOU SEE THESE TWO WELL-KNOWN REPUBLICANS IN THE STATE. I WORKED IN REPUBLICAN POLITICS A LONG TIME. IT USED TO BE JUST AN EARTHQUAKE. AND MAYBE THINGS ARE SO DIFFERENT NOW. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A REASON NOT TO VOTE FOR WALKER THAT MIGHT BE IT.  YEAH. I HAVE TO SAY IN SUCH A CLOSE RACE, WHAT APPEARS TO BE SUCH A CLOSE RACE ANYWAY, I THINK IT'S A VERY SMART AD FOR THE WARNOCK CAMP BECAUSE YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR EVERY VOTE AT THIS POINT. SO I ACTUALLY DO THINK THAT THE REALITY IS IN PART BECAUSE OF THE RIGHT-WING MEDIA KIND OF JUGGERNAUT THAT UNDECIDED VOTERS AND VOTERS WHO ARE OPEN TO CHANGING THEIR MINDS, WHO HAVEN'T ALREADY, ARE PROBABLY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN. BUT YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR EVERY SINGLE VOTE. SO NUMBER ONE, THAT AD MAKES SENSE BECAUSE SOME VOTERS JUST MAKE A GAME TIME DECISION. THEY GO WITH THEIR GUT. THEY TELL US ABOUT IT AFTERWARDS, WHICH DRIVES SOME OF US CRAZY. AND THEN YOU ALSO HAVE ON THE OTHER SIDE WHAT I'M VERY CURIOUS ABOUT DOWN IN GEORGIA, IS TO SEE HOW THE DEMOCRATIC BASE THERE REACTS TO THIS RACE. SO YOU KNOW, IT MAY -- WE CERTAINLY CAN PREDICT THAT BLACK VOTERS IN THE STATE WILL LARGELY VOTE DEMOCRATIC AS THEY DO OFTEN, BUT HOW MANY WILL SHOW UP? HOW ENTHUSIASTIC WILL THEY BE? THAT ALSO COULD MAKE THE DIFFERENCE HERE. AND I'M PARTICULARLY INTERESTED HOW THEY RESPOND TO THIS RACE GIVEN HOW CYNICAL AND SAD UNFORTUNATELY THIS RACE HAS BEEN, JUST THE IDEA THAT THESE TWO BLACK MEN ARE INTERCHANGEABLE IS SO SHAMEFUL AND SO ABSURD AND SO -- I THINK BLACK VOTERS PROBABLY KNOW THAT BUT I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE RETURNS DOWN THERE.  SAY MORE.  WELL --  I FEEL LIKE THERE'S MORE.  SURE. I THINK THAT WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT, YOU KNOW, BLACK AMERICANS TEND TO AFFILIATE WITH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY I DON'T THINK IT'S SO MUCH ABOUT A PARTISAN AFFILIATION SO MUCH AS IT'S ABOUT A SURVIVAL MECHANISM FOR UNDERSTANDING INTUITIVELY WHO IS GOING TO STAND UP FOR YOU AND FOR THE ISSUES THAT MATTER TO YOU MOST IN YOUR LIFE. AND I THINK THAT SOMEONE LIKE RAPHAEL WARNOCK, WHO THOUGH CERTAINLY IMPERFECT, NO CANDIDATE IS PERFECT, YOU KNOW, A PASTOR, SOMEBODY WHO HAS TAKEN HARD VOTES, SOMEONE WHO HAS WORKED EXTREMELY HARD FOR HIS COMMUNITY, TO PUT HIM AND HIS RESUME UP AGAINST A CANDIDATE LIKE HERSCHEL WALKER, WHO'S ESSENTIALLY JUST A CELEBRITY AND HAS REALLY SOME QUESTIONABLE PERSONAL HISTORY, IT'S SAD BECAUSE TO ME IT'S JUST HE EVOKES THE STEREOTYPES OF A BLACK MAN AND THE WAY I THINK WE FEAR UNFORTUNATELY -- THERE'S A HISTORY HERE IN THIS COUNTRY. WE FEAR AS BLACK AMERICANS THAT THAT IS HOW OUR BLACK MEN ARE SEEN. AND SO HERSCHEL WALKER IS ESSENTIALLY A LIVING AND WALKING EMBODIMENT UNFORTUNATELY OF THOSE STEREOTYPES. OF COURSE HE'S A HUMAN BEING. I DON'T KNOW HIM PERSONALLY. SO THIS IS REALLY NOT ABOUT HIM. IT'S ABOUT THE CYNICISM AROUND SUGGESTING THAT, YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S FINE. BECAUSE WE'LL JUST PUT UP A BLACK CANDIDATE AND THEY'RE INTERCHANGEABLE. AS THOUGH HERSCHEL WALKER IS INTERCHANGEABLE WITH RAPHAEL WARNOCK OR BARACK OBAMA. IT'S REALLY HURTFUL, AND I THINK BLACK VOTERS WILL RECOGNIZE THAT FOR WHAT IT IS. AND I THINK IF REPUBLICANS THINK THEY WON'T THEY MAY HAVE A SURPRISE COMING TOMORROW.  WELL, HALF OF THAT CYNICISM IS THE RIGHT-WING MEDIA ESTABLISHMENT'S DISPARAGEMENT OF THE VICTIMS OF HERSCHEL WALKER'S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SO JUST REFLEXIVELY, THE WOMAN WHO HAD A GUN HELD TO HER FACE WAS, WHAT, MISREMEMBERING? LYING? THAT IS SORT OF THE ROT OF THE RIGHT-WING DISINFORMATION MACHINE IN OVERDRIVE.  I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT I THINK IT'S THE DEFINITION OF INSANITY THAT ANYONE IS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THE POSSIBILITY THAT HERSCHEL WALKER WILL BE A UNITED STATES SENATOR. I MEAN, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THE LIES, THE HYPOCRISY, THE ABORTIONS, THE VIOLENCE, THE OBVIOUS UNFITNESS FOR OFFICE. BUT YOU ASKED BEFORE WHETHER -- WHAT THE RULES ARE. WHAT MATTERS. HERSCHEL WALKER WINS TOMORROW NIGHT OR IN THE RUNOFF ELECTION, AND I THINK IT'S A PRETTY GOOD INDICATION THAT NOTHING MATTERS, THAT IT IS ALL TRIBAL, THAT IT'S JUST SIMPLY WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO VOTE TO GIVE ONE PARTY CONTROL OVER THE OTHER PARTY. BECAUSE YOU KNOW, IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY MOMENT WHEN SOMEBODY -- WHEN SOMEBODY LIKE HERSCHEL WALKER IS EVEN COMPETITIVE. LOOK, YOU AND I BOTH REMEMBER WHEN ANY ONE OF THESE SCANDALS OR STORIES WOULD HAVE BEEN DISQUALIFYING, WHEN IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN JUST TWO EXCOMMUNICATED REPUBLICANS CUTTING AN AD, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ENTIRE PARTY CUTTING HIM LOOSE.  RIGHT.  IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNIVERSAL. AND THAT'S NOT HAPPENING. SO I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD INDICATION OF WHERE WE ARE IN OUR POLITICS RIGHT NOW. AND BY THE WAY, A QUICK REMINDER, TO KEEP AN EYE ON TOMORROW NIGHT, YOU HAVE TO GET 50% OF THE VOTE TO WIN THE ELECTION.  RIGHT. OR YOU GO TO A RUNOFF.  IF NEITHER CANDIDATE GETS 50% WE ARE IN A RUNOFF. SO FOR ALL YOU GEORGIA VOTERS WHO THINK IT'S GOING TO BE OVER TOMORROW NIGHT, NOT SO FAST.  YEAH. VOTE. VOTE, VOTE, VOTE. TIA, I WANT TO ASK YOU ONE QUESTION. I WAS READING SOME OF YOUR COVERAGE, SOME OF THE LOCAL COVERAGE. SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK HAS RUN A VERY -- AS A VERY BIPARTISAN SENATOR. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST REPUBLICAN THAT HAS APPEARED IN HIS CAMPAIGN MESSAGING. HE'S RUN ON BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION HE'S WORKED ON. SO JUST TALK ABOUT THE RACE THAT HE'S RUN IN THAT REGARD.  YES. THAT HAS REALLY BEEN PART OF HIS MESSAGE, IS NOT ONLY IS HE WILLING TO WORK IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION BUT HE'S WILLING TO PART WAYS WITH HIS PARTY ON CERTAIN ISSUES. YOU KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE, HE PUSHED FOR SUSPENDING THE FEDERAL GAS TAX OVER, YOU KNOW, PARTY LEADERS, PRESIDENT BIDEN DIDN'T NECESSARILY SUPPORT THAT. AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK SAID THIS IS WHAT I THINK YOU SHOULD BE DOING. YOU KNOW, HE'S BEEN OUT FRONT ON ISSUES LIKE VOTING RIGHTS AND EVEN SOME OF THE LEGISLATION AS FAR AS HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE COSTS, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE BIT IN FRONT OF PERHAPS HOW QUICKLY SOME OF THE PARTY LEADERS WERE MOVING ALSO ON STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS. SO HE'S BEEN SAYING I CAN WORK ACROSS THE AISLE, KIND OF GIVING HIMSELF -- TRYING TO APPEAL TO THOSE MODERATE VOTERS.  TIA MITCHELL, I KNOW YOU ARE RUNNING ALL OVER THE PLACE. WE REALLY WANTED TO TALK TO YOU AND WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR MAKING SOME TIME FOR US TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH. STILL AHEAD FOR US, THE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE WHERE THE RIGHT TO AN ABORTION IS ON THE BALLOT AND VOTERS THERE WILL DECIDE WHETHER TO ENSHRINE A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IN THAT STATE'S CONSTITUTION. THE STATE IS MICHIGAN. WE'LL HEAD THERE AFTER A QUICK BREAK. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. 20221107224720.015|20221107225025.284",

BUT I THINK A LOT OF THEM ARE GOING TO VOTE, YOU KNOW, IN SUPPORT SOFT DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES THAT SUPPORT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE ABORTION IS HEALTH CARE.  IT'S STILL SO JARRING TO HEAR, BECAUSE ROE WAS OVERTURN. THAT REALLY HAPPENED, AND THAT WAS ONE SUPPORTER OF MICHIGAN GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER ON WHY SHE'LL BE SUPPORTING THE GOVERNOR TOMORROW. IT COMES AS ABORTIONS ARE LITERALLY ON THE BALLOT IN MICHIGAN AND IN STATES LIKE NEBRASKA, KANSAS, PENNSYLVANIA, GEORGIA, WISCONSIN, FLORIDA, KENTUCKY, NORTH CAROLINA, AND ARIZONA, WHERE BALLOT REFERENDUMS AND THE CANDIDATES WHO WIN COULD DETERMINE WHETHER ABORTION IS ACCESSIBLE AT ALL FOR WOMEN WHO NEED ABORTION CARE. JOINING US FROM EAST LANCING, MICHIGAN, MODERATOR OF WASHINGTON WEEK ON PUBLICS, MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE, SHE'S BEEN REPORTING FROM MICHIGAN LEADING UP TO TOMORROW'S VOTE. TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE HEARING.  Reporter: GOOD EVENING, NICOLE. ALL EYES ARE ON MICHIGAN, AND I'M HERE AT MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY WHERE THEY'RE SAYING GO GREEN AND GO VOTE. THAT IS THE SLOGAN AS THIS CROWD IS WAITING IN ANTICIPATION OF GOVERNOR WHITMER TO COME OUT AND SUPPORT AND RALLY. YOU CAN SEE THE CROWD IS A PRETTY BIG CROWD. MOSTLY DEMOCRATIC -- I WOULD SAY FULLY DEMOCRATIC CROWD. THEY'RE TALK ABOUT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO VOTE. THEY'RE SAYING IT'S CRITICAL FOR PEOPLE TO SUPREME COURT PROPOSAL THREE. GRETCHEN WHITMER WENT ON TO SAY, THIS IS A CENTRAL PART OF HER CLOSING MESSAGE. THIS IS CRITICAL PART OF WHY SHE WANTS TO BE RE-ELECTED. HE OPPONENT SAYS THE OPPOSITE. SHE'S SAYING ABORTION ISN'T AN IMPORTANT ISSUE, SHE'S SAYING ECONOMY IS IMPORTANT. ALSO SAYING THAT ON ABORTION RIGHTS, SHE DOESN'T BELIEVE ABORTION SHOULD BE LEGAL IN ANY CASE, INCLUDING RAPE AND INCEST, SO ANYBODY'S CASE WHAT HAPPENS HERE. THE RACE TIGHTENED IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND MONTH BUT GRETCHEN WHITMER IS CONFIDENT SHE'LL ABLE TO PULL OUT A WIN HERE. BUT AS YOU CAN TELL, A LOT OF ENERGY AS THE GOVERNOR IS SUPPOSED TO BE COMING IT ON STAGE IN A FEW HOURS. I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THE CROWD. THEY'RE EXCITED AND READY. THIS IS BASICALLY WHAT PREELECTION DAY LOOKS LIKE HERE IN MICHIGAN.  EARLIER IN THE PROGRAM, CLAIRE McCASKILL MADE A GOOD POINT THAT NOBODY HAD TO ENSURE ALL THESE NATIONAL FORCES WE TALK ABILITY YOU'RE ON THE FRONT LINES, WHAT VOTING ROE LOOKS LIKE, BUT GRETCHEN WHITMER HAD TO LIVE WITH THE FEAR OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE AS IT WAS DIRECTED AT HER. HOW MUCH ARE THOSE THINGS IN THE AIR IN TERMS OF THE BASE THAT'S BEHIND YOU TONIGHT?  IT'S A CRITICAL QUESTION I SPOKE TO THE GOVERNOR ONE-ON-ONE. SHE WAS CLEAR SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT POLITICAL VIOLENCE IS SOMETHING THAT'S A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY, TO HER PERSONALLY. THEY WERE POLITICAL CONVICT OF PLOTTING TO KIDNAP AND DO HARM TO HER, SO THIS IS DEFINITELY TOP OF MIND. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REPUBLICANS, INCLUDING PEOPLE RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR, BUT ALSO PEOPLE IN THIS STATE, SECRETARY OF STATE AS WELL AS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL -- [ INAUDIBLE ] SO NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE THE THREAT OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND PEOPLE BEING CONVICTED HERE, BUT YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS ON THE ENTIRE BALLOT TO MIGHT CHANGE THE MAKEUP OF THE LEADERSHIP, AND PEOPLE IN MICHIGAN KNOW IT.  DONNA, LET ME BRING YOU INTO THIS CONVERSATION. GOVERNOR WHITMER HAS RUN A FANTASTIC CAMPAIGN. SHE HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE -- A LOT OF THE ELECTION DENIERS. WE'VE COVERED THE EFFORTS IN THE STATE. IT WAS THE TARGET OF A LOT OF TRUMP'S EFFORTS TO OVERTURN HIS LOSS. WHAT DO YOU MAKE A HER CLOSING MESSAGE? AND WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE WATCHING FOR IN MICHIGAN TOMORROW?  I THINK IT'S REALLY INTERESTING THAT WE'VE ASKED THE QUESTION ACROSS THE COUNTRY ABOUT WHETHER ABORTION POLITICS ARE A DRIVER IN ANY OF THESE RACES, AND WHAT STRIKES ME IS THAT GRETCHEN WHITMER HAS THE ABILITY, OBVIOUSLY. SHE CAN WALK AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME, AND SHE'S DECIDED THAT TO DRIVE ENTHUSIASM, TO DRIVE MORE VOTERS TO THE POLLS, THAT THIS ISSUE, THE QUESTION OF LINKING HERSELF WITH PROPOSAL 3 ON THE BALLOT, IS GOING TO DO THAT. AND I THINK THAT SHE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT, THAT THAT'S THE DIFFERENCEMAKER. THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO MAY BE REGISTERING AND VOTING AT HIGHER RATES THAN THEY HAVE BEFORE, AND I THINK GRETCHEN WHITMER HAS MADE THE CALCULATION THAT TO GET THAT EDGE AT THE END, SHE HAS A DIRECT CONTRAST WITH HER OPPONENT AND SHE HAS THE ENTHUSIASM GOING INTO ELECTION DAY.  YAMICHE, ARE YOU GOING TO BE THERE ELECTION DAY?  I WILL BE HERE IN MICHIGAN ON ELECTION DAY. I'LL BE LOOKING FOR, WHAT IS THE RESULTS OF THE ABORTION REFERENDUM? AROUND THE COUNTRY YOU SEE INFLATION BE THE TOP ISSUE, BUT THERE ARE SOME POLLS THAT REALLY SAY VOTERS THINK ABORTION IS A BEING ISSUE. AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. ALSO THE MOOD IN TERM OF, ARE PEOPLE FEELING INTIMIDATED? ARE PEOPLE FEELING SAFE? ALSO, THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. WITH ALL THE ELECTION DENIERS ON THE BALLOT, I'M WONDERING, ARE PEOPLE GOING TO WIN?  YOU'RE FROM MICHIGAN. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING?  I WENT TO SCHOOL IN MICHIGAN, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S VERY STRIKING LISTENING TO HER IS THAT ACTUALLY IT'S NOT JUST GRETCHEN WHITMER WHO HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH THE IMMEDIACY OF THE THREATS. EVERYDAY MICHIGAN VOTER HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH SO MANY OF THE SAME NATIONAL THREATS PERSONALLY, SO MICHIGAN IS ONE OF THE STATES WHERE ABORTION RIGHTS, IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE DOBBS DECISION, WERE, YOU KNOW, KIND OF IN QUESTION. AND SO I THINK THAT EVERYDAY UNCERTAINTY IS GOING TO DRIVE MORE WOMEN ESPECIALLY TO THE POLLS, PROBABLY FOR WHITMER, THAN OTHERWISE WHAT HAPPENED.  YAMICHE, CHARLIE, DONNA, MARA GAY, THANK YOU. QUICK BREAK. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. 'LL BE RIGH. 20221107225654.440|20221107225720.999",

        "trs": "> FIVE SEATS. THAT'S ALL THE REPUBLICANS NEED TO PICK UP AND FLIP THE HOUSE. THE SMALLEST NUMBER THE PARTY IN POWER HAS NEEDED IN 90 YEARS. IN PAST WHEN PRESIDENTS' POPULARITY WERE IN THE MID 40s AS THEY ARE NOW, THE PARTIES ALWAYS LOST BIG IN THE MIDTERMS. IN 2018, THE PRESIDENT HAD AN APPROVAL RATING LIKE PRESIDENT BIDEN'S. IN 2010, WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA WAS DOWN, DEMOCRATS LOST 63 SEATS. WHAT HE CALLED A SHELLACKING. AN OUT LIAR WAS AFTER THE 9/11 ATTACKS WHEN BUSH AND THE REPUBLICANS HELD THE CHAMBER, BUT BEFORE THAT, DEMOCRATS LOST 54 HOUSE SEATS UNDER CLINTON. DEMOCRATS ARE LOOKING TO BREAK THAT STREAK. AND WITH US NOW, DEBBIE DINGLE IN MICHIGAN. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR COLLEAGUE. SHE IS ONE OF THE TWO MOST VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS IN THIS CYCLE ACCORDING TO ALL REPORTS. WHAT DO YOU SEE IN HER RACE?  GOOD AFTERNOON, ANDREA. ALWAYS GOOD TO BE WITH YOU. I WAS CANVASSING WITH HER ON SATURDAY. THERE IS FOR ME, A NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE ON THE GROUND IN THE LAST 24, 48 HOURS. ENTHUSIASM IS GOING UP. I THINK SHE'S GOING TO WIN HER RACE. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO WIN THREE OF THE CLOSELY CONTESTED RACES IN THIS STATE. I THINK WE'RE REFLECTIVE OF THE COUNTRY. IT'S RAZOR THIN IN RACES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO SEE, ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE HOUSE AND I THINK MANY PEOPLE ARE DECIDING RIGHT NOW.  ABORTION IS ALSO LITERALLY ON THE BALLOT IN MICHIGAN WITH THAT CONSTITUTIONAL REFERENDUM. SUPPORT SEEMS TO HAVE SHRUNK RECENTLY AMONG DEMOCRATS. WAS IT A MISCALCULATION TO FOCUS SO MUCH ON ABORTION EARLY IN THE CYCLE NATIONALLY, NOT ONLY IN MICHIGAN, RATHER THAN THE ECONOMY SOONER?  ANDREA, IT'S TWO DIFFERENT ISSUES. I'VE BEEN ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE SAID WE COULD, WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE ECONOMY. I THINK BOTH ISSUES ARE DRIVING PEOPLE TO THE POLLS. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF CONFUSION ABOUT THE BALLOT PROPOSAL IN MICHIGAN. THERE'S A TON OF FLAT OUT BAD MISINFORMATION. CHILDREN ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE STERILIZED. PARENT OF CONSENT IS STILL GOING TO BE THERE. AND IT IS TIGHTER, QUITE FRANKLY, THAN IT SHOULD BE AND PEOPLE WHO REALLY CARE ABOUT THIS ISSUE ARE GOING TO NEED TO VOTE AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON THAT BALLOT PROPOSAL.  THE POLITICAL BOARD HAS MOVED MICHIGAN GOVERNOR'S RACE FROM LIKELY DEMOCRAT TO LEANING DEMOCRAT. WHICH IS A DOWNGRADE FOR THE DEMOCRATIC HOPES OF GOVERNOR WHITMER. SO RUNNING AGAINST DIXON AS YOU KNOW. WHO IS AN ELECTION DENIER. ALSO ELECTION DENIERS ON THE STATE BALLOT, THE STATE TICKET FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL, SECRETARY OF STATE. AND WE SAW THE FOILED KIDNAPPING PLOT AGAINST YOUR GOVERNOR. SO HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT THESE THREATS IF DEMOCRATS WIN ALL THESE KEY RACES?  I'M GOING TO BE VERY BLUNT. I HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING WITH THE GOVERNOR EVERY DAY FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS. COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO, I WAS WORRIED ON THIS RACE. I'VE AGAIN SEEN ENTHUSIASM SHIFT. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY CLOSE RACE BUT WHAT I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IN MICHIGAN IS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER STATES WHERE THERE'S ALREADY AN EFFORT TO CHALLENGE VOTES, AND I THINK WE WILL HAVE SERIOUS EFFORTS MADE THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION TO CHALLENGE THE RESULTS OF MANY OF THESE VOTES. PEOPLE ARE DELIBERATELY TRYING TO UNDERMINE PEOPLE'S CONFIDENCE IN THIS ELECTION AND TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM VOTING AND TO MAKE VOTES NOT REALLY COUNT. WE SAW THE SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDATE ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE TRYING TO CHALLENGE ANY VOTE THAT HAD ALREADY BEEN PASSED. WAS CHALLENGED IN THE COURT, BUT I EXPECT MICHIGAN'S GOING TO BE A STATE THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF ATTENTION ON IT THE DAY AFTER THE ELECTION.  QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE BLACK TURNOUT. WHAT ARE YOU SEEING THERE?  I THINK IT IS IMPROVING. I THINK YOU'RE STARTING TO SEE MORE PEOPLE GOING TO THE POLLS WAS STRONG YESTERDAY. I THINK DEMOCRAT MATTERS, BUT I THINK A LOT OF OTHER COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE MATTER AS WELL.  THANK YOU. STAY SAFE OUT THERE.  YOU, TOO. > OUTSIDE THE BELT WAY, CONTROL OF STATE CAPITALS COULD HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT. STAY WITH US. YOU'RE WATCHING MSNBC. MAJOR IM.

        "trs": "MICHIGAN WHERE VOTERS COULD AMEND THE CONSTITUTION TO PROTECT WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS. GOVERNOR WHITMER HAS STRESSED THE ISSUE WITH TUDOR DIXON AND IN FLORIDA, ONE APPEARS TO BE AHEAD. JOINING US NOW, YAMICHE IN SPRINGFIELD, MICHIGAN. BLAINE ALEXANDER IN ATLANTA AND ALI IN DELL RAY BEACH. TALK TO ME ABOUT THE ABORTION MEASURE AND HOW IT'S PLAYING IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE.  Reporter: ALL EYES ARE ON MICHIGAN AND PROPOSAL THREE IS GOING TO POSSIBLY ENSHRINE ABORTION RIGHTS INTO THE STATE CONSTITUTION. NOW GOVERNOR WHITMER, A DEMOCRAT RUNNING FOR RE-ELECTION HERE, SHE'S BEEN CENTERING HER CAMPAIGN AND HER CLOSING ARGUMENT ON PUSHING FOR ABORTION RIGHTS SAYING SHE'S THERE TO PROTECT WOMEN'S RIGHTS. SHE'S ALSO BEEN CAMPAIGNING ALONGSIDE PRO-ABORTION ADVOCACY GROUPS, ALSO SAYING NOT NOVEMBER, BUT ROVEMBER AND SAYING INFLATION SHOULD BE THE THING THAT'S TOP OF MIND. HER MESSAGE, DIXON, THE REPUBLICAN WHO'S GOING TO BE HERE IN A FEW HOURS, SHE'S BEEN SAYING WHILE ABORTION RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT, SHE'S SAYING THIS IS REALLY A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE ECONOMY. ABOUT BUSINESSES. THIS SHOULD BE A CONVERSATION OF ENDING COVID RESTRICTIONS. ALL THIS BEING SAID, THE VOTERS HERE HAVE ABORTION TOP OF MIND BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN SAID THAT ABORTION IS ON THE BALLOT IN A LOT OF STATES QUITE LITERALLY HERE, IT IS ON THE BALLOT. AS ABORTION IS A TOP ISSUE, SO THE DEMOCRACY. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES HERE WHO ARE VOTING, WHO HAVE QUESTIONED THE 2020 ELECTION.  THANKS TO YOU. AND BLAINE ALEXANDER IN GEORGIA, THERE'S RECORD BREAKING EARLY VOTING WE'RE TOLD. THE ACLU IS THERE. THEY'RE SEEING OVER MAIL-IN BALLOTS. WHAT'S GOING ON?  Reporter: YEAH, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY IS COMING ON ELECTION EVE, ANDREA. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LAST MINUTE CHALLENGES. I JUST SPOKE WITH THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ACLU HERE IN GEORGIA AND SHE SAYS RIGHT NOW, THEY HAVE ATTORNEYS IN COURT IN COBB COUNTY ARGUING THAT MORE THAN 1,000 VOTERS NEVER GOT THEIR ABSENTEE BALLOTS SO THEY'RE ARGUING THIS SHOULD BE AN EXTENSION. GEORGIA LAW SAYS ABSENTEE BALLOTS HAVE TO BE RECEIVED BY THE TIME POLLS CLOSE. THEY'RE ARGUING IT SHOULD BE EXTENDED FOR THE MONDAY AFTER FOR MILITARY BALLOTS. THEY'RE POINTING TO GEORGIA'S CONTROVERSIAL NEW VOTING LAW. THEY SAY THE REASON THAT THIS DELAY HAPPENED IS BECAUSE THAT NEW LAW ESSENTIALLY SLASHED THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT COUNTIES CAN MAIL OUT BALLOTS AND SLASHED THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT PEOPLE CAN REQUEST BALLOTS BEFORE ELECTION DAY. HERE'S WHAT SHE TOLD ME.  IN 2020, A MILLION AND A HALF PEOPLE IN GEORGIA VOTED. WE VOTED BY MAIL. WE TOOK OUR BALLOT TO A DROP BOX. THIS PROCESS WORKED FLAWLESSLY. PEOPLE, THE BALLOTS WERE AUDITED. WE HAD NUMEROUS RECOUNTS IN GEORGIA. THERE WAS NO REASON TO CHANGE THE PROCESS. BUT THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR CAME IN, SLASHED THE DAYS TO PROCESS MAIL-IN BALLOTS AND AS A RESULT, WE SEE THAT A MILLION FEWER MAIL-IN BALLOTS HAVE BEEN CAST IN THIS ELECTION.  Reporter: WE SHOULD SAY THE SECRETARY OF STATE, BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, HAS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDED THIS LAW. HE SAID WHAT IT DOES IS MAKES IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE BALLOT AND THAT'S SOMETHING HE'S SAID ALL ALONG WITH BRIAN KEMP.  GOVERNOR RON DeSANTIS, HE'S BEEN POPULAR DOWN THERE AGAINST HIS CHALLENGER, ANOTHER FORMER GOVERNOR, CHARLIE CRIST. HOW IS TRUMP'S SLAM ON HIM OVER THE WEEKEND PLAYING AMONG REPUBLICANS?  Reporter: WELL, ANDREA, YOU'VE GOT A FLORIDA GOVERNOR WHO'S POPULAR, SEEMINGLY ON A GLIDE PATH TO RE-ELECTION THEN A POPULAR FORMER PRESIDENT WHO CALLS FLORIDA HOME NOW. BOTH SEEMED LIKE THEY WERE ON A COLLISION COURSE. FOR THOSE OF US WHO LOOK AT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION CYCLES WELL BEFORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE, IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE WE WERE HEADING TOWARDS A DONALD TRUMP VERSUS RON DeSANTIS POTENTIAL MOMENT IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FOR 2024. FOR MANY PEOPLE ON THE GROUND HERE IN FLORIDA, THEY LOOK AT DeSANTIS' BID AS A POSSIBLE SPRING BOARD TO SOMETHING LARGER. CLEARLY, THAT'S SOMETHING TRUMP IS KEEPING HIS EYE ON AS WELL BECAUSE WE HEARD HIM IN PENNSYLVANIA GIVING DeSANTIS A NICKNAME. WHAT IT DOES IS PUT OUT IN THE OPEN THE FEUD THAT HAD BEEN SIMMERING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS FOR MONTHS THAT MANY OF US HAD BEEN HEARING ABOUT FOR MONTHS FROM OUR SOURCES. NOW THAT IT'S OUT IN THE OPEN, DOESN'T DETRACT NECESSARILY FROM WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON ELECTION NIGHT IN FLORIDA. BUT WHAT IT DOES IS IT STARTS THE CLOCK EARLY ON 2024 AS PEOPLE ARE ALREADY LOOKING AHEAD AND VOTERS THAT I TALKED TO ON THE GROUND YESTERDAY AS TRUMP WAS HERE RALLYING WITH MARCO RUBIO, DeSANTIS WAS HAVING HIS OWN EVENT AND VOTERS WERE AWARE OF THE FACT THERE SEEMS TO BE A SCHISM FORMING HERE. SOME TELLING ME IF THEY WERE TO MAKE A CHOICE, THEY WOULD GO WITH DeSANTIS, AT LEAST IN FLORIDA. HIGH ARRIVAL RATINGS AND ON A GLIDE PATH TO RE-ELECTION.  PRETTY EXTRAORDINARY. THANKS SO MUCH TO YOU AND TO YAMICHE AND BLAINE AS WELL. AND ANXIETY LEVELS. THEY ARE HIGH AS DISTRESSED AND DISINFORMATION ARE RUNNING RAMPANT IN THE RUN UP TO THE FIRST MAJOR ELECTION SINCE JANUARY 6th. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT NEXT.

        "trs": "> WE'VE GOT A MILITARY THAT IS MORE INTERESTED IN PRONOUNS THAN IN WINNING WARS. WE HAVE GOT AN FBI, AN FBI THAT IS MORE INTERESTED IN TREATING PARENTS AS DOMESTIC TERRORISTS THAN IN PROSECUTING REAL TERRORISTS.  BOY, I TELL YOU WHAT. THAT'S THE INSURRECTIONIST, JOSH HAWLEY.  SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT.  REPUBLICANS USED TO SUPPORT THE UNITED STATES MILITARY. USED TO SUPPORT THE FBI. USED TO SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THIS IS WHAT'S SO CRAZY. THEY LOSE ONE ELECTION, THEY LOSE ONE ELECTION, AND SUDDENLY --  HE'S MR. INSURRECTION.  THEY TURN ON THE MILITARY. THEY TURN ON MADISONIAN DEMOCRACY. THEY TURN ON LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY TALK ABOUT DEFUNDING THE FBI. IT'S REALLY JUST CRAZY. ROBERT GIBSON, DO YOU EVER THINK WE WOULD GET TO A POINT WHERE REPUBLICANS WOULD LOSE ONE ELECTION AND THEN YOU HEAR A LOT OF THIS. THIS ISN'T A ONE-OFF. THESE PEOPLE LOVE ATTACKING THE UNITED STATES MILITARY.  YOU WATCH THAT CLIP AND THE FIRST THING I THINK OF IS, AS A STAFFER WATCHING A RALLY LIKE THAT, YOU BEGIN TO SCRAMBLE, WE HAVE TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. WE CAN'T LET SOMEBODY GO UP ON THE STAGE AND SAY THAT AND HAVE THEM BELIEVE THAT'S OUR BELIEF.  RIGHT.  AND IT'S FAIRLY STUNNING BECAUSE, I MEAN, IT WAS A HIT AND RUN WITH THE MILITARY, THE FBI, LAW ENFORCEMENT. REALLY STUNNING. AND IT SHOWS YOU, I THINK, TOO, THERE AREN'T A LOT OF CONSEQUENCES TO THAT KIND OF RHETORIC. REPUBLICANS AREN'T FEELING LIKE THERE'S THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT SORT OF CRITICISM, WHICH IS A REMARKABLE PLACE TO BE IN 2022.  AND THERE'S A TRASHING OF THE MILITARY, THE TRASHING OF OUR TOP GENERALS, JONATHAN, AND YOU EVEN HAD SENATORS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE RUSSIAN/UKRAINIAN WAR SAYING, I WISH THAT OUR MILITARY COULD BE AS MANLY AS THE RUSSIAN MILITARY. ANYBODY WHO UNDERSTANDS WHERE THE UNITED STATES MILITARY IS TODAY, UNDERSTANDS THEY ARE STRONGER, MORE POWERFUL, MORE WELL VERSED IN URBAN WARFARE. THE STRONGEST FIGHTING MILITARY MACHINE IN THE HISTORY, IN THE HISTORY OF THIS WORLD. AND YET REPUBLICANS, BECAUSE THEY LOST ONE ELECTION, REPUBLICANS ARE TRASHING THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES. IT'S BREATHTAKINGLY STUPID, FIRST OF ALL. IT IS ALSO JUST UNPATRIOTIC.  I BELIEVE SENATOR TED CRUZ IS AMONG THOSE WHO APPROVINGLY TWEETED VIDEO OF MACHO RUSSIAN SOLDIERS. THIS IS, WE CAN TAKE A STEP BACK, BEFORE 2020, LET'S REMEMBER DONALD TRUMP BEGAN AN ONSLAUGHT ON THE MILITARY, QUESTIONED THE PATRIOTISM OF JOHN McCAIN, SAID HE PREFERRED HEROES THAT DIDN'T GET CAPTURED. THROUGHOUT HIS TIME IN OFFICE, HE BELITTLED THE PENTAGON, BELITTLED HIS GENERALS WHO WORKED FOR HIM. HE TURNED ON THEM BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T SAY YES TO EVERYTHING HE ASKED THEM TO DO. THAT BECAME EVIDENCE THE MILITARY WAS PART OF THE DEEP STATE CONSPIRING AGAINST HIM. THEY DIDN'T WANT TO GO FORWARD WITH THE TRUMP AGENDA AND POST THIS ELECTION, THEY HAVE BEEN RAPPED UP WITH THE FBI AND LAW IF FORCEMENT WITH OTHER PARTS OF THE GOVERNMENT THAT THE REPUBLICANS USED TO STAND BEHIND. USED TO SAY THAT'S WHERE WE ARE. SUCH A KEY PART OF THEIR IDENTITY. NOW THEY HAVE TURNED THEIR BACK BECAUSE THEY HAVE FOLLOWED TRUMP'S LEAD. THAT'S ANOTHER MOMENT WHERE THEY FEEL LIKE THE DEEP STATE IS CONSPIRING AGAINST THEM.  LET'S BRING IN NBC NEWS NATIONAL POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT STEVE KORNACKI AT THE BIG BOARD. SO WE'RE A DAY AWAY HERE. HOW DOES IT LOOK?  WELL, WE DO HAVE OUR FINAL NBC POLL. WE CAN TAKE YOU THROUGH, IT CAME OUT YESTERDAY, LOOK AT THE GENERIC BALLOT. REGISTERED VOTERS IN OUR POLL HERE. WE HAVE IT DEAD EVEN, 47% DEMOCRATS, 47% REPUBLICANS. THE QUESTION ASKED, WHICH PARTY DO YOU WANT TO SEE CONTROLLING CONGRESS HERE. WHAT MAKES THIS SO INTERESTING IS THAT NUMBER IS A BIT AT ODDS WITH THIS NUMBER. HISTORICALLY, JOE BIDEN, HIS APPROVAL RATING CLOCKING IN AT 44%. DISAPPROVE, WELL OVER 50%. HISTORICALLY, THIS HAS BEEN A NUMBER THAT HAS MEANT BIG TROUBLE FOR THE INCUMBENT'S PARTY. PUT THIS IN SOME PERSPECTIVE. FROM OUR FINAL NBC POLL BEFORE ALL OF THE RECENT FIRST TERM MIDTERMS FOR PRESIDENT, 44 IS RIGHT IN LINE WITH WHERE TRUMP WAS IN 2018. THAT WAS A 40-SEAT LOSS FOR THE REPUBLICANS. RIGHT IN LINE WITH OBAMA IN 2010. THAT WAS A 63-SEAT LOSS FOR DEMOCRATS. YOU SEE THE ONE OUTLIER HERE BACK IN 2002, GEORGE W. BUSH, ONE YEAR POST-9/11, HE HAD A 63% APPROVAL RATING THAT HE CARRIED INTO ELECTION DAY. REPUBLICANS PICKED UP A HANDFUL OF SEATS IN THAT MIDTERM ELECTION. SO BIDEN RIGHT IN THE DANGER ZONE, JUST IN TERMS OF HIS APPROVAL RATING. YOU LAYER ON TOP OF THAT WHAT PEOPLE SAY IN POLL AFTER POLL, IS THE TOP ISSUE ON THEIR MINDS AS THEY MAKE UP THEIR MINDS IN THIS ELECTION, THE ECONOMY. STATE OF SATISFACTION WITH THE ECONOMY, 19% SATISFIED. 81% DISSATISFIED. YOU BASICALLY HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE CRASH, TO THE GREAT RECESSION, 2009, 2010, THAT AWFUL MIDTERM YEAR FOR BARACK OBAMA, TO FIND NUMBERS LIKE THIS. SO WHY WOULD THE GENERIC BALLOT BE TIED IN OUR POLL WITH HEADWINDS LIKE THIS FOR DEMOCRATS? THE SIMPLEST ANSWER IS THEY DID PICK UP ON OUR POLLSTERS DID, A SHIFT IN THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS ON THAT QUESTION OF ENTHUSIASM. THIS IS THE BIGGEST WILD CARD HERE, WE'RE EXPECTING 120, 130 MILLION PEOPLE TO TURN OUT IN THIS MIDTERM ELECTION. THAT NUMBER, THOSE NUMBERS, THAT RANGE. TOTALLY, TOTALLY WILDLY ABOVE WHAT WE'RE USED TO SEEING IN PAST MIDTERMS. IT STARTED TO CHANGE IN 2018. THE LAST TIME WE TOOK A POLL, REPUBLICANS HAD A NINE-POINT ENTHUSIASM ADVANTAGE OVER DEMOCRATS. IN OUR NEW POLL, IT SITS NOW TIED AT 73. SO DEMOCRATS IF THEY'RE GOING TO CARRY HOPE INTO THE MIDTERM ELECTION, WE RARELY, RARELY SEE A WHITE HOUSE PARTY ACTUALLY PICK UP HOUSE SEATS. IT'S HAPPENED TWICE SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN A MIDTERM ELECTION. WE OFTEN SEE THE WHITE HOUSE PARTY GET BLOWN OUT, ESPECIALLY WITH THE KINDS OF NUMBERS I JUST SHOWED YOU WITH JOE BIDEN. IF DEMOCRATS ARE CARRYING SOME HOPE INTO TOMORROW FOR A BETTER THAN EXPECTED DAY, I THINK THIS IS THE NUMBER THAT SPEAKS TO IT, THAT IN THE END, THERE JUST ENDS UP BEING AN EQUAL LEVEL OF ENTHUSIASM HERE. IT CARRIES DEMOCRATS TO THE POLLS WHO MAY NOT BE WILD ABOUT BIDEN, MAY NOT BE WILD ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY. MAYBE IT'S REACTION TO THE REPUBLICANS, BUT THAT WOULD BE THE HOPE OF DEMOCRATS IF YOU LOOK AT THAT GENERIC BALLOT AND THEIR HOPE TO SORT OF SURVIVE AGAINST WHAT WE JUST SHOWED YOU ARE SOME ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL HISTORICAL HEADWINDS. AGAIN, TO REMIND YOU, LOOKING AT THE SENATE BATTLEGROUND MAP. FIVE MOST VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS, FIVE MOST VULNERABLE REPUBLICANS. PENNSYLVANIA, WHERE EVERYONE WAS, OBAMA, TRUMP, BIDEN THIS WEEKEND, SO IMPORTANT FOR DEMOCRATS IN THEIR SENATE HOPES BECAUSE AGAIN, THIS IS THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR DEMOCRATS TO PICK OFF A CURRENTLY REPUBLICAN HELD SENATE SEAT, AND IF DEMOCRATS CAN PICK THAT UP IN PENNSYLVANIA, THEY COULD ABSORB A LOSS IN ONE OF THESE BLUE STATES HERE. YOU SEE THE MOST VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS HERE. YOU COULD HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION ABOUT WHERE THAT MIGHT BE, BUT THERE'S WARNING SIGNS FOR DEMOCRATS IN NEVADA, IN GEORGIA IN PARTICULAR, AND ACTUALLY A WILD CARD THAT'S EMERGED IN THE LAST WEEK OR TWO HERE, NEW HAMPSHIRE. SORT OF A QUIRKY, FUNKY STATE POLITICALLY. NEW HAMPSHIRE SUDDENLY COULD BE AT RISK FOR DEMOCRATS. THEY HAVE TO GET THAT WIN IN PENNSYLVANIA, IF THEY DO, THEY COULD ABSORB A LOSS SOMEWHERE ELSE ON THE BOARD AND RETAIN CONTROL OF THE SENATE.  SO, STEVE, WE WERE TALKING OVER HERE ABOUT NEVADA. AND THE RACE THERE. JON RALSTON, WHO WE ALL WATCH WHAT HE SAYS, THINKS THE DEMOCRATS ACTUALLY ARE GOING TO HOLD ON TO THAT SEAT. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY POLLING THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT?  WE HAVE SEEN POLLING THAT SHOWS IT DEAD EVEN IN NEVADA. AND I THINK HIS PROJECTION WOULD BE, HE'S SAYING A NARROW, VERY NARROW VICTORY FOR CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO, THE INCUMBENT, BUT WE'LL TAKE OUT NEVADA AND SHOW YOU THE DYNAMICS AT WORK THERE. AGAIN, THE MATCHUP, CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO, ADAM LAXALT. POLLING HAS BEEN CLOSE HERE. TAKE A LOOK AT 2020, THE PRESIDENTIAL RESULT HERE IN NEVADA. 2 1/2-POINT VICTORY FOR JOE BIDEN OVER DONALD TRUMP. BASICALLY EQUAL TO WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016. 2 1/2, 2 POINT, 4-POINT MARGIN FOR HILLARY CLINTON OVER DONALD TRUMP. THE STORY IN NEVADA HAS BEEN GO BACK A DECADE TO THE OBAMA RE-ELECTION IN 2012. FOLKS WERE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT NEVADA AS MORE OF A BLUE STATE AND LESS OF A SWING STATE. YOU COULD SEE OBAMA WON BY BASICALLY SEVEN POINTS IN 2012. THIS IS A PLACE WHERE TRUMP MADE SURPRISING INROADS IN 2016 AND REALLY KIND OF HELD THOSE INROADS IN 2020. IF YOU WANT TO DIG DEEP INTO IT, WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT TRUMP ACTUALLY BETWEEN '16 AND '20, HE ACTUALLY IMPROVED HIS PERFORMANCE A BIT IN CLARK COUNTY. THAT'S LIKE 70% OF THE VOTE IS GOING TO COME OUT OF THE LAS VEGAS AREA. TRUMP LOST IT, BUT HE ACTUALLY IMPROVED HIS STANDING A BIT IN CLARK COUNTY. MIGHT BE PART OF THE NATIONAL STORY THAT CAME OUT OF 2020 WHERE THERE WERE SOME SURPRISING TRUMP AND REPUBLICAN GAINS WITH HISPANIC VOTERS. BUT TRUMP LOST GROUND UP HERE IN WASHOE COUNTY WHERE RENO IS. IT ENDED UP BEING A 2 1/2-POINT MARGIN STATE WIDE. LOOK, THE POLLING HAS BEEN CLOSE. ROLSTON PUT HIS PREDICTION IN. HE HAS A PRETTY GOOD TRACK RECORD. HE KNOWS THE STATE, CERTAINLY RAISES THE POSSIBILITY DEMOCRATS COULD HOLD THE SEAT, BUT IT'S ONE REPUBLICANS CERTAINLY BELIEVE IS ONE OF THEIR BEST PICKUP OPPORTUNITIES TOMORROW AS WELL.  AND STEVE, TAKE A LOOK AT VIRGINIA, IF YOU COULD TALK ABOUT WHY THAT STATE IS IMPORTANT AND ESPECIALLY KIND OF DETERMINING HOW THE REST OF THE NIGHT MIGHT GO POSSIBLY, AND ALSO OUR NEXT GUEST IS ABIGAIL SPANBERGER, HOW HER RACE LOOKS.  SO VIRGINIA HAS THE 7:00 P.M. EASTERN CLOSING TIME. AT LEAST IN THEORY, WE'LL SEE HOW FAST THEY COUNT THE VOTE, BUT WE WOULD GET AN EARLY READOUT FROM A COUPLE CRUCIAL CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. IN THE SECOND DISTRICT, THE VIRGINIA BEACH AREA, LANE LURIE IS THE DEMOCRAT. SHE'S PART OF THAT CLASS OF 2018. JEN KIGENS, REPUBLICANS VERY EXCITED ABOUT HER AS A NOMINEE. YOU SEE THIS IS A BIDEN PLUS TWO DISTRICT. BIDEN CARRIED IT BY TWO POINTS. GLENN YOUNGKIN LAST YEAR RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA WON THE SAME DISTRICT BY DOUBLE DIGITS. THIS IS THE KIND OF RACE THAT'S SORT OF A BASELINE TEST FOR REPUBLICANS. IF THEY'RE WINNING BIDEN PLUS TWO DISTRICTS AROUND THE COUNTRY, THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR THEM TO GET THE HOUSE. IT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO GET A HUGE MAJORITY IN THE HOUSE, BUT ENOUGH TO GET THE HOUSE. THIS IS KIND OF A BASELINE TEST. THEN YOU TALK ABOUT A RACE, YOU'RE MENTIONING THE SEVENTH DISTRICT, ABIGAIL SPANBERGER, LESLIE VEGA. THIS WAS CHANGED BY THE REDISTRICTING IN VIRGINIA. IT USED TO BE A RICHMOND SUBURB DISTRICT. THE LINES HAVE MOVED NORTH. THEY'RE CREEPING INTO THE D.C. METRO AREA. PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY, FAST GROWING, DIVERSE, RIGHT OUTSIDE WASHINGTON, D.C. COUNTY. A BIG CHUNK OF THAT IS NOW IN THIS DISTRICT. FOR SPANBERGER, TWO CHALLENGES HERE. ONE, NEW CONSTITUENTS SHE HASN'T HAD TO FACE BEFORE. HASN'T HAD TO DEAL WITH BEFORE. TWO, WHILE BIDEN DID CARRY THE DISTRICT BY SIX POINTS IN 2020, AGAIN, LAST YEAR IN THE 2021 GUBERNATORIAL ELECTION IN VIRGINIA, THIS WAS A YOUNGKIN PLUS FIVE DISTRICT. SO I LOOK AT THE SEVENTH DISTRICT OF VIRGINIA, IF TWO IS A BASELINE TEST FOR REPUBLICANS, ARE THEY WINNING THE SORT OF BIDEN PLUS TWO, IF THEY'RE WINNING BIDEN PLUS SIX DISTRICTS, IF REPUBLICANS ARE WINNING THIS TOMORROW NIGHT, NOW WE'RE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT SOME KIND OF A WAVE FORMING FOR REPUBLICANS. AND THEN YOU CAN MAKE YOUR WAY UP, ACTUALLY, TO THE TENTH DISTRICT HERE. THIS IS THE AREA THAT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE WASHINGTON, REALLY TRENDED DEMOCRATIC OVERWHELMINGLY IN THE LAST DECADE OR SO. REPUBLICANS ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THEIR RECRUIT IN THIS RACE. BIDEN PLUS 18. IF THIS RACE IS COMPETITIVE, INSIDE FIVE POINTS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT, I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A REAL REPUBLICAN WAVE TAKING HOLD TOMORROW NIGHT.  ALL RIGHT, STEVE KORNACKI, WE'LL SEE YOU AGAIN REAL SOON. INCUMBENT CONGRESSWOMAN ABIGAIL SPANBERGER OF VIRGINIA JOINS US NOW. WE WERE JUST TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT THE STATE OF YOUR RACE. DISTRICT THAT WAS YOUNGKIN PLUS FIVE, AND YOU JUST GOT THE ENDORSEMENT OF LIZ CHENEY. HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK THAT WILL HELP GIVEN THE ODDS IN THIS RACE?  I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT DEMONSTRATES, AGAIN, I'M BUILDING A COALITION OF PEOPLE WHO ARE FOCUSED ON GOVERNANCE, ON FUNCTIONAL GOVERNMENT. I HAVE THE ENDORSEMENT OF CONGRESSMAN CHENEY, AND SHE SAID REALLY, I THINK, DEFINITIVE THINGS IN THE CONTRAST BETWEEN MY OPPONENT AND ME AND WHY SHE'S CHOSEN TO ENDORSEMENT. I ALSO HAVE AN ENDORSEMENT FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, FROM A LOCAL POLICE CHIEF, AND IMPORTANTLY, FROM CONSTITUENTS ACROSS OUR DISTRICT OF ALL POLITICAL STRIPES. AND IT SPEAKS TO THE FACT THAT I AM DOING GOOD WORK ON THE GROUND, BOTH AS A CONGRESSPERSON AND CERTAINLY AS I RUN FOR RE-ELECTION ACROSS OUR DISTRICT.  CONGRESSWOMAN, IT'S KATTY KAY HERE. THIS WEEKEND, IN A WAY YOU ARE THE PERFECT CANDIDATE FOR YOUR DISTRICT. YOU'RE A FORMER CIA CASE OFFICER. YOU'RE NOW IN A DISTRICT WITH A LOT OF FEDERAL WORKERS INCLUDING PENTAGON WORKERS AND MEMBERS OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY. YOU HAVE DISTANCED YOURSELF IN THE PAST FROM THE LEFT OF THE PARTY. IF YOU CAN'T WIN VIRGINIA SEVENTH DISTRICT ON TUESDAY, WHAT DOES IT SUGGEST ABOUT THE FATE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MORE BROADLY ON A NATIONAL LEVEL?  KATTY, I'M GOING TO WIN ON TUESDAY, TOMORROW. WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT THE PARTY OR AT LEAST MY WORK IN CONGRESS IS WHEN YOU'RE FOCUSED ON THE GROUND ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT MATTER TO PEOPLE, CUTTING COSTS, FOCUSED ON PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES AND THE IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S LIVES, RECOGNIZING THE CHALLENGES AT THE MEAT COUNTER OR AT THE GAS PUMP, WHEN YOU'RE FOCUSED ON MAKING REAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY LIKE THE INFRASTRUCTURE BIM, LIKE OUR CHIPS BILL, AND WHEN YOU'RE RESOLUTE IN WANTING TO PROTECT OUR RIGHTS, ABORTION RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, THAT IS A MESSAGE THAT RESONATES WITH PEOPLE. IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT I AM NOT ONLY GOVERNING BY BEING PRESENT AND ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE THAT I CURRENTLY REPRESENT, BUT FOR THOSE CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE DISTRICT, I HAVE BEEN CAMPAIGNING EVERYWHERE SO PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET ME AND MORE IMPORTANTLY I HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO THEM.  CONGRESSWOMAN, SOME OF THE MOST OPTIMISTIC PUBLIC POLLING THAT I HAVE SEEN FOR DEMOCRATS SHOWS AN ENERGIZED YOUNGER VOTER BASE, 18 TO 39. DO YOU FEEL LIKE IN YOUR DISTRICT THAT'S AN ENERGIZED VOTER BASE THAT YOU'LL NEED TO GET OUT TOMORROW?  FOR THE PURPOSES OF ENGAGING IN OUR DEMOCRACY, WE WANT OUR YOUNGEST VOTERS TO FEEL THAT OUR DEMOCRACY BELONGS TO THEM, FRANKLY BECAUSE THE POLICIES I'M WORKING ON ON CAPITOL HILL, THOSE LONG TERM IMPACTS MATTER IN FACT MOST TO OUR YOUNGEST VOTERS AND TO THE NEXT GENERATIONS. IN OUR DISTRICT, I CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO SEE ENGAGED ENTHUSIASM FROM YOUNG VOTERS. A LOT OF FIRST-TIME VOTERS VOTING EARLY, VOTING WITH THEIR PARENTS. THERE'S A CELEBRATORY OR KIND OF LIFE EVENT TONE. I MET ONE WOMAN WHO HAS TRIPLETS AND SHE'S TAKING EACH OF HER TRIPLETS OUT TO VOTE ON DIFFERENT DAYS EARLY. SO YES, IT IS EXCITING TO SEE SO MANY YOUNGER VOTERS. AND NOT JUST THE YOUNGER VOTERS BUT KIDS GOING WITH THEIR PARENTS BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF CASTING A BALLOT SO THEY'RE READY TO DO IT WHEN THEY TURN 18.  DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN ABIGAIL SPANBERGER OF VIRGINIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING ON THE SHOW THIS MORNING. > WE HAVE STEVE RATTNER HERE WITH US. AND YOU'RE LOOKING --  YOU KNOW WHAT HE BROUGHT?  DID HE BRING THE CHARTS?  WAKE UP THE KIDS. RATNER HAS THE CHART.  GOT SOME CHARTS.  YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE MONEY RACE.  MONEY RACE. YES, TWO THINGS TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE MONEY RACE. FIRST, IS THE EXTRAORDINARY MONEY BEING SPENT. AND SECONDLY, THE FACT THAT DEMOCRATS DON'T HAVE A MONEY PROBLEM. THEY MAY HAVE OTHER PROBLEMS BUT MONEY IS NOT ONE. THE FIRST CHART SHOWS YOU THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SPENDING EXPECTED IN THIS RACE. THESE ARE INFLATION ADJUSTS SO THAT INCREASE YOU SEE IS AFTER INFLATION. WE'RE EXPECTING SOMETHING LIKE $9 BILLION TO BE SPENT ON THESE JUST ON THE SENATE AND CONGRESSIONAL RACES THIS CYCLE. AND BY COMPARISON, WE SPENT $1.7 BILLION BEFORE ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION BACK IN 2000. JUST TO PUT IT IN MORE CONTEXT, IN ONE SENATE RACE, JUST IN GEORGIA, THERE'S GOING TO BE $250 MILLION SPENT BY BOTH SIDES. AND I THINK MANY OF US AROUND THIS TABLE CAN REMEMBER WHEN 10% OF THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A REASONABLE AMOUNT FOR A STATE LIKE GEORGIA IN A SENATE RACE. $250 MILLION. $250 MILLION COULD PROVIDE SOMETHING LIKE 20 MEALS FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED FOOD, AGAIN, TO PUT THAT IN SOME CONTEXT OF WHY THIS IS MAYBE NOT THE BEST USE OF OUR MONEY.  UNBELIEVABLE. SO TELL ME ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS. IT SURPRISES ME, BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN ARTICLES SHOWING THAT SO MANY OF THE MASSIVE DONORS ARE REPUBLICAN BUSINESS PEOPLE.  AND THEY ARE, AND I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT, BUT LET ME SHOW YOU BEFORE WE -- LET ME SHOW YOU THE WHOLE PICTURE AND TAKE FOUR SENATE RACES WE HAVE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT A LOT. YOU CAN SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. SO THE BLUE BARS TO THE LEFT IS DEMOCRATS. THE RED BARS TO THE RIGHT ARE REPUBLICANS. THE DARKER COLORS ARE WHAT WE CALL HARD MONEY, THE $2900 THAT IS THE MOST VALUABLE MONEY FOR CAMPAIGNS BECAUSE THEY GET DISCOUNTED TELEVISION TIME, AND THE SHADED COLORS ARE SOFT MONEY, THE BILLIONAIRES AND ALSO LOTS OF OTHER SMALLER PEOPLE.  BY THE WAY, IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I HAVE RUN. WHAT ARE THE LIMITS NOW FOR HARD MONEY?  $29 FOR THE GENERAL.  PER PERSON.  PER PERSON.  SO THE DEMOCRATS DO VERY WELL WITH THAT, NOT SURPRISINGLY, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT OF SMALL MONEY DONORS. YOU CAN SEE IN NEVADA, THE DARK BLUE BAR IS MANY TIMES THE SIZE OF THE RED BAR. EVEN WHEN YOU PUT IN THE SOFT MONEY, IN NEVADA, $18 MILLION SPENT BY DEMOCRATS TO $60 MILLION SPENT BY THE REPUBLICANS. CORTES MASTO HAS OUTSPENT LAXALT BY TWO TO ONE AND IS STILL LOOKING AT WHAT SHE'S LOOKING AT. IN ARIZONA, $128 MILLION BY MARK KELLY COMPARED TO $48 MILLION FOR BLAKE MASTERS.  THAT'S FASCINATING BECAUSE ALL WE HAVE HEARD IS ABOUT PETER THIEL AND HIS MONEY TO MASTERS. BUT ACTUALLY, DEMOCRATS LIKE YOU SAID DOING EXCEPTIONALLY WELL ON THE MONEY SIDE THERE.  YEAH, PETER THIEL'S $10 MILLION IS IN THERE, BUT IT STILL ONLY GETS HIM TO $47 MILLION. THE MOST EXPENSIVE RACE IS PENNSYLVANIA. AND ALSO THE CLOSEST ON THE MONEY RACE, $151 MILLION FOR FETTERMAN. $121 MILLION FOR DR. OZ.  SO DEMOCRATS -- ARE DEMOCRATS OUTSPENDING REPUBLICANS NATIONWIDE THIS YEAR?  YEAH. THAT IS THE TAKEAWAY FROM ALL THIS. DEMOCRATS HAVE RAISED A GOOD BIT MORE MONEY THAN REPUBLICANS.  SO FORGIVE ME FOR ASKING THIS NEXT QUESTION. YOU HAVE TO ASK THE QUESTION.  YES.  SO HAVE DEMOCRATS FIGURED OUT HOW TO USE CITIZENS UNITED MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN REPUBLICANS?  YEAH, IN PART. THEY HAVE. FIRST OF ALL, THEY DO MUCH BETTER IN THE HARD MONEY. YOU CAN SEE THE DARK COLORED BARS, THE $2900 MONEY. BUT YEAH, THEY DO QUITE WELL. LET ME SHOW YOU THAT ON THE NEXT CHART. THIS IS THE SO-CALLED SOFT MONEY. YOUR BILLIONAIRES ARE ON THE LEFT, THE TOP 50 MEGA DONORS. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE REPUBLICANS DO SUBSTANTIALLY OUTCONTRIBUTE THE DEMOCRATS. SEVEN OF THE TEN LARGEST INDIVIDUAL DONORS ARE REPUBLICANS. THAT IS A FACT. THAT LITTLE BIT OF SHADING IS GEORGE SOROS WHO PUT $127 MILLION IN HIS PAC BUT HAS ONLY SPENT $15 MILLION. THE DEMOCRATS DO GET WELL OUTRAISED AND OUTSPENT BY THE --  WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? IS HE NOT SPENDING THE MONEY?  HE HAS PUT IT INTO HIS POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEE BUT IT HASN'T COME OUT YET.  WHAT IS HE WAITING FOR?  YOU HAVE TO ASK HIM.  ISN'T THE ELECTION TOMORROW?  LET ME ASK YOU QUICKLY, ON THE REPUBLICAN MEGA DONOR SIDE, HAS THE GUY THAT RUNS THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY, LEONARD LEO, WHO LIKE INHERITED $1.6 BILLION, HAS THAT STARTED TO BE SPENT YET.  IT'S NOT IN THESE NUMBERS. IT MAY SHOW UP IN THE FINAL NUMBERS BUT HE'S NOT AMONG THE TOP DONORS AT THIS MOMENT. BUT TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS FEEDING ON SOFT MONEY. WE HAD A HUGE GAP ON THE TOP 50 MEGA DONORS. WHEN YOU ADD ALL THE OUTSIDE SPENDING, LESS WEALTHY PEOPLE, SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS, IT'S ALMOST NO GAP. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE ALMOST AS MUCH SOFT MONEY AS THE REPUBLICANS. LET ME ALSO SAY, THIS IS NOT THE BIGGEST PART OF THE CAMPAIGN SPENDING. ALL THIS STUFF ADDS TO UP ABOUT $1.7 BILLION OR $1.8 BILLION OUT OF THE $8 BILLION I WAS TALKING ABOUT BEFORE. MOST OF THE MONEY THAT GETS RAISED AND SPENT IS HARD DOLLAR MONEY OR MONEY BY THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEES. SMALL DONORS. OR THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEES, THE DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL COMMITTEES AND THE REPUBLICAN ONE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. IT'S PRETTY SURPRISING. NOT WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE GUESSED.  NOT AT ALL.  A FEW DAYS AGO, TED CRUISE QUESTIONED WHAT DONALD TRUMP WAS DOING, WHY HASN'T HE SPENT IT? THESE NUMBERS ARE ASTRONOMICAL. WHAT DOES THIS PORTEND FOR 2024? ARE WE GOING TO BE OFF -- EVEN ONE OF YOUR CHARTS, ARE WE GOING TO BE OFF THEM?  WE'RE IN A RIDICULOUS STUPID ARMS RACE. AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES THAT COULD BE PUT TO BETTER USE. A LOT HAS TO DO WITH CITIZENS UNITED. A LOT HAS TO DO WITH ENERGY. PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED SO IT INCLUDES OPENING UP THEIR WALLETS. AND UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, YEAH, THE NEXT RACE IS GOING TO BE A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THIS RACE.  THE LAST CHART, I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED. OVERALL, WHO HAS RAISED THE MOST MONEY THIS ELECTION CYCLE, DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS?  DEMOCRATS BY A MARGIN. I DON'T HAVE A CHART, BUT WHEN YOU ADD UP THE PIECES, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY OUTRAISED. THEY HAVE PROBLEMS, MONEY IS NOT ONE OF THEM. YOU HAVE TO SAY WHAT WHERE THE DEMOCRATS' PROBLEMS.  REVEREND AL, YOU INTERVIEWED PRESIDENT BIDEN YESTERDAY FOR YOUR RADIO SHOW. HERE'S WHAT HE SAID ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD MEAN IF DEMOCRATS WERE TO LOSE CONTROL OF CONGRESS.  WE JUST HAVE SUCH OPPORTUNITIES IF WE JUST STEP UP. MY CONCERN THIS ELECTION THOUGH IS IF WE DON'T WIN, THEY'RE GOING TO WIPE OUT EVERYTHING WE HAVE DONE. I'LL BE ABLE TO VETO SOME OF THE STUFF, BUT SOME OF IT THEY'RE GOING TO WIPE OUT. IT'S GOING TO GO AWAY. AND IT MAKES NO SENSE.  AND HE DOES HAVE A LOT OF WINS ON THE BOARD. DEMOCRATS HAVE A LOT TO BRAG ABOUT BECAUSE OF WHAT JOE BIDEN HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH.  HE WANTED TO COME AND REALLY LAY OUT, BECAUSE WE WERE ON MANY BLACK RADIO STATIONS AS WELL AS SIRIUS XM, AND I WANT TO PLAY THE WHOLE THING THIS AFTERNOON. HE WANTED TO LAY OUT WHAT HE HAS ACCOMPLISHED AND THAT HE WOULD HAVE DONE MORE IF HE DID NOT HAVE BLOCKING FROM THE SENATE REPUBLICANS. AND WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE, WE COMPLAIN, AND RIGHTFULLY SO, THAT WE DIDN'T GET THE JOHN LEWIS VOTER PROTECTION BILL OR THE GEORGE FLOYD BILL. BUT EVERY REPUBLICAN VOTED AGAINST THE JOHN LEWIS VOTING BILL. EVERY ONE. WE KIND OF EMPHASIZE AND GOT ANGRY AT THE TWO DEMOCRATS, SINEMA AND WEST VIRGINIA, MANCHIN, FOR NOT GOING WITH THE FILIBUSTER, BUT WE FORGET THE OVERWHMING REPUBLICAN VOTE, NOT ONE BROKE AND VOTED FOR THE VOTING BILL. NOT ONE WANTED TO SUPPORT GEORGE FLOYD, YET THE PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO GET SOME THINGS DONE, VERY SUBSTANTIAL THINGS DONE, AND THAT'S WHAT WE TALK ABOUT ON THE RADIO.  REVEREND AL SHARPTON AND STEVE RATTNER, THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH FOR BEING ON THIS MORNING.  STILL AHEAD ON \"MORNING JOE,\" PRESIDENT BIDEN MAKES A STOP IN PENNSYLVANIA AND TAKES ON REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE DR. OZ. WE'LL SHOW YOU THAT MOMENT. > PLUS, FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP WAS ALSO ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL OVER THE WEEKEND, RALLYING FOR, AS THE \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\" EDITORIAL BOARD PUT IT, HIMSELF.

        "trs": "> TO YOU SERVED AS A SENATOR FROM 2001 TO 2009. WHAT SENATOR IS THE BIGGEST BLOW HARD?  TOO MANY TO COUNT.  I WOULD HAVE TO SAY TED CRUZ IS THE ETERNAL BLOW HARD, RIGHT?  THE ETERNAL BLOW HARD.  IT'S 54 PAST THE HOUR. THAT WAS A QUESTION FROM THE GAME \"PLEAD THE FIFTH\" ON BRAVO'S \"WATCH WHAT HAPPENS LIVE.\" HE POINTED HOW HILLARY CLINTON HAS NEVER PLEADED THE FIFTH, AND DONALD TRUMP HUNDREDS OF TIMES IN A RECENT DEPOSITION. GUESS WHO'S HERE RIGHT NOW?  HAPPY 15th ANNIVERSARY, FOLKS.  THANK YOU. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?  NO. IT'S NOT LIKE \"WATCH WHAT HAPPENS LIVE,\" BUT WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE CAMERA'S NOT ON. WHEN THE CAMERA WASN'T ON, MIKA STARTED INSULTING --  SHE INSULTED ME ON THE COMMERCIAL BREAK. SHE SAID I LOOK CADAVER-ESQUE.  I SAID YOU LOOK TIRED.  I THINK YOU LOOK DASHING.  I GOT A LITTLE FEELING OF WHAT IT MAYBE FEELS LIKE TO BE JOE.  SHE TELLS ME ALL THE TIME. CONSTANT.  HONEY, YOU HAVE A FEELING OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO DO THESE HOURS. IT IS NOT GOOD.  RIGHT. I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT YOUR 15th ANNIVERSARY.  AW. THANK YOU.  GREAT.  HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING YOUR GIG?  13 1/2 YEARS.  WHOA.  \"WATCH WHAT HAPPENS LIVE.\"  IT'S GREAT.  WHEN YOU STARTED THAT, I'M WONDERING, DID PEOPLE THINK, OH, THAT'S GOING TO LAST A MINUTE.  I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GOING TO LAST.  THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES I SAW IT, PROBABLY THE FIRST COUPLE TIMES YOU SAW \"MORNING JOE,\" THIS IS KIND OF COOL FOR THIS YEAR. IT'S NOT TO GOING TO LAST.  OKAY.  PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO BE A SUCCESS.  THEY DON'T.  IT TOOK OFF LIKE CRAZY.  IT DID.  YOU'RE BRINGING IT BACK. THANK YOU, JOE.  IT MAY BE THE SINGLE GREATEST BROADCAST SHOW.  YOU JUST DID SUCH A TRUMP THING, WHICH IS MANY PEOPLE -- TOO MANY PEOPLE SUGGEST --  I DON'T KNOW.  I LOVE IT THAT YOU TWO ARE A COUPLE.  OH, MY GOD.  I DON'T NEED TO DISCUSS IT.  WE DON'T.  WHEN YOU LEAVE THE SHOW -- DO YOU EVER LEAVE HERE AND SAY YOU DIDN'T LET ME SPEAK TODAY?  YES.  DO YOU EVER SAY YOU DIDN'T LET ME MAKE MY POINT?  THE ELECTION IS TOMORROW.  WHAT'S FUNNY IS PEOPLE SAY I TALK OVER HERE AND THEY GO, LET MIKA TALK, IT'S HORRIBLE. AND ALL THE MEN ARE, LIKE, WAIT A SECOND, YOU DON'T THINK MIKA IS NOT, LIKE, RUNNING EVERYTHING HERE? TO YOUR POINT, IF I EVER DO ANYTHING SHE DOESN'T LIKE, WE ALL HEAR ABOUT IT.  WOW.  SHE'S A BRZEZINSKI.  YES, SHE IS.  I'M VERY SWEET.  HAVE YOU EVER WHAT?  HAVE YOU EVER --  WHAT?  ON THE WRONG SIDE OF MIKA?  NO. NOT MIKA.  OCCASIONALLY.  A COUPLE TIMES.  A COUPLE TIMES.  I GET FEEDBACK. I GET FEEDBACK.  BUT HONESTLY, TALKING WITH ANDY ABOUT THE ELECTION NOT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, US. WE DON'T DO THAT.  YOU CAN TALK ABOUT ANYTHING YOU WANT. IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.  I ALWAYS LOVE COMING HERE.  IT'S BIG DAY.  IT IS. HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT IT?  THE FUTURE OF AMERICA IS ALL IN OUR HANDS.  LITERALLY.  I WOKE UP DEPRESSED, BUT THEN I REALIZED IT'S THE GREAT HOPE OF AMERICA. THIS IS IN OUR HANDS. IF WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT --  GO DO SOMETHING.  -- ABOUT ABORTION RIGHTS BEING TAKEN AWAY, OR GAY RIGHTS, WE CAN PICK UP OUR GRANDMAS OR FRIENDS AND GO TO THE POLLS AND MAKE IT HAPPEN. MAKE A CHANGE. MAYBE TODAY SHOULD BE FULL OF OPTIMISM ABOUT WHAT TOMORROW SHOULD BE.  I CAN'T PICK UP MY GRANDMA. SHE PASSED AWAY.  I'M SORRY.  AGAIN --  I AM SORRY.  I DON'T EVEN KNOW THIS GUY.  IT'S TRUE. TOM BROKAW TOLD ME BACK IN 2008 WHEN EVERYBODY WAS PREDICTING THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS GOING TO GET WIPED OUT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE, HE SAID, YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE JUST WAIT TILL THE VOTERS GO OUT? SO EVERYBODY TRYING TO TELL US WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TOMORROW, THE VOTERS HAVEN'T SPOKEN YET.  YES. I AM, THOUGH, WORRIED ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR STATE.  YEAH.  I WAS OUT CAMPAIGNING FOR KATHY HOCHUL OVER THE WEEKEND, AND I THINK DEMOCRATS IN NEW YORK STATE NEED TO WAKE UP A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE LEE ZELDIN IS VERY CLOSE TO HER.

        "trs": "\u266a \u266a \u266a WELCOME BACK TO POLITICSNATION. I HAVE MY POLITICAL PANEL WITH ME TO LOOK AHEAD TO TUESDAY'S MIDTERM ELECTION. JOINING ME NOW IS MICHAEL THIEL, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR AND FORMER CHAIR THE REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE. AND FORMER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR, BELL JONES OF ALABAMA. CURRENTLY A DISTINGUISHED FELLOW, SENIOR FELLOW -- DOUGLASS THOUGHT. LET'S START WITH THE CLOSING ARGUMENTS FROM DEMOCRATS AHEAD OF TUESDAY'S VOTE. YESTERDAY PRESIDENT BIDEN AND FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA -- IN PHILADELPHIA TO SUPPORT GIVEN EDITORIAL CARROTS JOSHUA PIRRO, AND SENATE CANDIDATE JOHN FETTERMAN. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA HAD TO SAY.  ONE DEMOCRACY -- [INAUDIBLE] YOU CAN'T TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. YOU NEED TO WORK FOR A. YOU NEED TO NURTURE IT. YOU NEED TO FIGHT FOR IT. BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS, YOU GET TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AS LONG AS YOU TURN OUT TO VOTE.  WHAT'S YOUR OPINION, IS THIS THE RIGHT MESSAGE TO VOTERS THAT THEY GET READY TO ENTER THE POLLS?  THANKS FOR HAVING ME ON A GALLON. I THINK IT'S A PART OF IT. I DON'T THINK IT'S THE ONLY -- CHERI BEASLEY IN NORTH CAROLINA THIS WEEKEND. AND IT RESONATES. I THINK THE ATTACK ON SPEAKER PELOSI'S HUSBAND BROUGHT BACK, CONNECTED THE DOTS BACK TO JANUARY SIX. PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND DEMOCRACY. IT'S ESPECIALLY COMING FOR A FORMER PRESIDENT LIKE BARACK OBAMA, HE'S A VERY POWERFUL MESSAGE. BUT IT NEEDS TO BE COUPLED [INAUDIBLE] ACCOMPLISHMENTS. THANKS TO REDUCE INFLATION, INFRASTRUCTURE BILLS, ALL OF THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED. I THINK THAT WE LEAVE THIS TO ONE ARGUMENT AT THE END AND DEMOCRATS --  MICHAEL, ANOTHER FORMER PRESIDENT, DONALD, TRUMP IS IN MIAMI RIGHT NOW. HOLDING A RALLY IN SUPPORT OF FLORIDA SENATOR MARCO RUBIO. WHO LAST NIGHT AT ANOTHER RALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA TRUMP TOOK AIM AT FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS. TAKE A LISTEN.  [INAUDIBLE] IRAN HAS SAID 10%. MIKE PENCE HAS SAID. -- CHENEY, THERE'S NO WAY SHE [INAUDIBLE]  WE WERE NOT AT TRUMP'S EVENT TODAY. IN FACT, HE'S HOLDING HIS OWN PACKED CAMPAIGN EVENT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STATE, AND HILLSBORO, SARASOTA, AND LEE COUNTY'S. FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP REPORTEDLY JUMPING AT THE BIT -- VERY PRESIDENTIAL RUN. EVEN CONSIDERING AN ANNOUNCEMENT LAST NIGHT ACCORDING TO -- DO YOU THINK THE BATTLE IS ON BETWEEN THESE TWO FORMER POLITICAL ALLIES, DESANTIS AND TRUMP?  SO, HERE IS HOW I TAKE IT. IT REALLY THE GOES BACK TO THE QUESTION, I DON'T CARE. DONALD TRUMP IS GONNA DO WITH DONALD TRUMP'S GONNA DO WHEN HE DOES IT. THE FACT THAT WE'RE ON THE CUSP OF ONE OF THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL ELECTIONS IN OUR LIFETIME. THIS MIDTERM, BEING DISTRACT ABOUT WHAT DONALD TRUMP MAY OR MAY NOT DO. I DON'T GIVE A RATS -- AT THIS PLAY. WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON, IS MAKING SURE THAT VOTERS UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE ELECTION DENIERS ON THE BALLOT. YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS WHO WANT TO TURN BACK THE CLOCKS ON CIVIL RIGHTS. WOMEN'S RIGHTS, HUMAN RIGHTS, AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE FOCUS. THE BATTLE BETWEEN DESANTIS AND TRUMP IS SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN. IF IT HAPPENS AT ALL. I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED TRUMP STETSON. BUT IF HE DOES, WILL ADDRESS HIM AT THAT POINT IN TIME. I THINK RIGHT NOW, IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP DOES BEST. MAKING HIMSELF THE FOCUS OF THE ATTENTION OF THE TIME, WE DON'T GIVE A DAMN. AND WE SHOULDN'T GIVE A DAMN. AND THAT'S ALL I GOTTA SAY.  NOBODY -- BUT THE REALITY AS, HE DRIVES A LOT OF THE REPUBLICAN VOTERS. AND THE REASON WHY WE HAVE A LOT OF THOSE CANDIDATES THAT WE HAVE IS BECAUSE OF TRUMP.  HE'LL DRIVE THEM FOR THAT ELECTION IN MIAMI. THE TURNOUT NUMBERS RIGHT NOW ARE HUGE. I TRUST ME ON THIS, IT'S NOT ALL REPUBLICANS.  FOR SURE.  TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS. I BET YOU A LOT OF THOSE REPUBLICANS AREN'T VOTING FOR A TRUMP ELECTION DENIERS. LET'S KEEP THE FOCUS ON THE BALL IN FRONT OF US. WHICH IS THE ONE WE -- AT THE BALLOT BOX THIS TUESDAY. THAT'S MY PUSH.  LET ME PUSH YOU ON THAT POINT. STICK IN WITH YOU, REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ARE EXCITED TO VOTE IN THIS ELECTION, OUR NBC POLL -- WHAT THE REPUBLICANS AN ENTHUSIASM. AND IDENTICAL 73% FOR BOTH PARTIES SAY THEY'RE HIGHLY INTERESTED, THEY'RE REGISTERING EITHER A NINE OR TEN ON A TEN-POINT SCALE. IT ALL COMES DOWN TO VOTER TURNOUT. THE GOP IS TRIED TO USE CULTURE WARS TO HAVE A FAIR BASE OF DEMOCRATS HAVE TRIED TO PULL THIS ON THE THREATS TO DEMOCRATIC SYSTEMS AND BASIC RICE SUCH AS ACCESS TO ABORTION, AND VOTER RIGHTS. WHAT SIDE DO YOU THINK HAS THE MOMENTUM, MICHAEL?  RAT, EVERYTHING I'VE LOOKED AT TWO POINTS, A LOT OF THE POLLING THAT'S BEEN PUSHED OUT BY REPUBLICANS OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS ARE A CROCK. THEY'RE LOADED, IT'S TO REDEFINE THE LANDSCAPE BECAUSE THE PRIVATE POLLING SHOWS WEAKNESS. THAT POLL, 73 AND 73 IN ENTHUSIASM IS A REFLECTION OF WHAT THE PRIVATE POLL SHOWING. DEMOCRATS HAVE CLOSED THE GAP IN TERMS OF ENTHUSIASM. THE GENERIC VOTE, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE CLOSED THE GAP ON THAT AS WELL. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT DEMOCRATS ARE GONNA HAVE A BLUE WAVE. IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT REPUBLICANS ARE RIDING A WEB WAVE. WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT VOTERS ARE ENGAGING DIRECTLY IN THE CAMPAIGN. AT THE FACT THAT OUR NBC COOLING, AS YOU WELL KNOW TODAY, SHOWS THAT THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE, HERE WE GO BUDDY, THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IS NOT THE ECONOMY, NOT INFLATION, IT'S DEMOCRACY. AND THAT TELLS ME A LOT ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.  IT CHANGES EVERYTHING. IT CHANGES EVERYTHING. DOUG, PRESIDENT BIDEN'S CAMPAIGNING IN NEW YORK. SPEAKING ON THIS STAGE IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS. HE'S CAMPAIGNING FROM NEW YORK GOVERNOR KATHY HOCHUL. SHE'S IN A TOP GUBERNATORIAL RACE WITH HER REPUBLICAN OPPONENT, LISA ALLEN. WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS CLOSE ELECTION AND AND A RELIABLY BLUE STATE?  I THINK AT A TIME WHEN TIME ACCREDITS SHOULD BE DOING WELL. BUT THERE'S CONCERNS OUT THERE. DEMOCRATS ARE ADDRESSING THEIR CONCERNS. THERE'S CONCERNS ABOUT -- DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSING THAT. THERE IS CONCERNS ABOUT INFLATION. PEOPLE ARE MAKING AT THAT. I AGREE -- I DON'T ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH EVERYTHING MIKE JUST SAID. ESPECIALLY -- ABOUT DONALD TRUMP RIGHT NOW. I DO THINK THAT ALL THE RACES ARE TIGHTENING UP. IT'S NOT JUST IN THE BLUE STATE. LET ME TELL YOU, I WAS IN IOWA, AND I'VE BEEN WATCHING MIKE FRANKLIN CLOSING THE GAP ON CHUCK GRASSLEY. I'M IN OKLAHOMA, WATCHING KENDRA HORN CLOSING THE GAP ON MARKWAYNE MULLIN. IN NORTH CAROLINA, AND I THINK SHARON THESE LEE CAN LEND INSPIRATION IN NORTH CAROLINA. IT'S NOT JUST A BLUE STATE THAT GETS A LOT OF ATTENTION. I'M TELLING YOU, AND SOME OF THESE RED STATES, THAT ARE VERY COMPETITIVE RACES, DEMOCRATS ARE GONNA DO REALLY WELL. THAT'S WHY -- THEY'LL DO FINE. I FEEL GOOD ABOUT THIS RACE.  MICHAEL STEELE AND DOUG JONES, FROM BIPARTISAN PATOOTIE -- TONIGHT. THANK YOU BOTH, A REMINDER THAT YOU CAN JOIN MSNBC FOR SPECIAL COVERAGE AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY, AT 7 PM EASTERN.

        "trs": "WELCOME BACK TO POLITICSNATION, TWO DAYS OUT FROM THE MIDTERMS DEMOCRATS IN SEVERAL SWING STATES ARE HOPING THAT BLACK VOTER TURNOUT IN BIG NUMBERS. PROBABLY YOU NOWHERE MORE SO THAN GEORGIA. WHERE THE SENATE CONTEST BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC SENATOR, RAPHAEL WARNOCK, AND HERSCHEL WALKER IS IN A DEAD HEAT RIGHT NOW. AS MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF MILLION GEORGIA VOTERS HAVE ALREADY CAST BALLOTS. JOINING ME NOW, IS THE REVEREND DR. W. FRANKLIN RICHARDSON, THE COORDINATING SOULS TO THE POLLS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AND CHAIR OF THE CONFERENCE OF NATIONAL BLACK CHURCHES. HE'S ALSO THE CHAIRMAN -- NATIONAL ACTION NETWORK. THE BLACK CHURCH HAS LONG BEEN A MOBILIZING FORCE IN FACILITATING THE BLACK VOTE. -- AND THAT TRADITION GOING AHEAD OF THE ELECTION DAY, SENDING SOULS TO THE POLLS AS WE CALL IT IN THE MOVEMENT. REVEREND RICHARDSON, ALLEN IMPORTANT IS THE BLACK CHURCH AND THIS ELECTION CYCLE. AND SPECIFICALLY, IN GEORGIA, WHO ARE I KNOW -- SPEAK ON A NONPARTISAN WAY?  I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER HAD A MORE CRITICAL TIME IN OUR LONG HISTORY. IT'S A SORDID HISTORY. WE HAD TO FIGHT A LONG WAY. THIS IS A VERY -- THERE'S OF 6000 PASTORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY THIS MORNING AGAIN. ENCOURAGING THEM NOT JUST FOR THEM TO VOTE, BUT TO GET OUR PEOPLE OUT, OUR FAMILIES OUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE. IN GEORGIA, WE HAVE STAFF ON THE GROUNDS GETTING THE VOTE OUT. WE HAVE PASTORS WORKING HARD. -- AND ONE OF OUR MEMBERS, FROM THE LAST ELECTION HITTING A WHOLE MOVEMENT TO GET THE GEORGIA VOTE OUT. I DON'T THINK THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY, I KNOW THEY DOWNPLAY OUR ENTHUSIASM BUT I DON'T THINK -- DETERMINED TO FIGHT THAN WE ARE RIGHT NOW.  YOU MENTION, GEORGIA, REGARD TO GEORGIA THERE IS SOME BLACK CHURCH -- HAVE CRITICIZE THE GOP'S NOMINATION OF HERSCHEL WALKER TO THE U.S. SENATE. AND WALKER'S CAMPAIGN HAS TAKEN ISSUES THAT THEY -- DIVISIVE MESSAGE COMING. AND A PASSIVE ENDORSEMENT OF WALKER'S OPPONENT IS PERCEIVED DEMOCRATIC SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK. I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT RACIAL DYNAMICS THAT WORK AND THIS GEORGIA SENATE RACE. DO YOU AGREE, IN YOUR CRITICISMS, OF THAT FACT?  I'M VERY CONCERNED OVER WHAT RULES THEY DID, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO PUT ANOTHER BLACK MAN AGAINST THIS BLACK MAN. WHAT'S SO -- BEST PERSON THEY CAN FIND. BUT IT'S REALLY -- IN MY OPINION TO AFRICAN AMERICAN PROFILE. HERSCHEL WALKER DOES NOT REPRESENT THE KIND OF -- AFRICAN AMERICANS PUT FORTH ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY, WE PUT OUR HANDS AROUND A LEADER. HERE SHE IS ALWAYS COMPETENT. THEY NEVER COULD ARGUE OF THE CONFIDENCE VOTE FROM BARACK OBAMA TO A WHOLE HOST OF PEOPLE, MAYORS, AND CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE NEVER PUT FORWARD PEOPLE THAT ARE GROSSLY INCOMPETENT. I'M CONCERNED WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. THEY HAD TO PICK SOMEBODY THAT IS TOTALLY INCOMPETENT TO BE SENATOR, HAS A SHAKY RECORD, AND PUT HIM UP AGAINST ANOTHER BLACK MAN, TO TRY AND HOLD THE SPACE. I'M OUTRAGED FROM THAT PARTY. WE'RE GONNA OWN THAT. CHURCHES ARE CLEAR. PEOPLE -- THE WORD IS GETTING AROUND IN OUR COMMUNITY. THAT REVEREND WARNOCK, -- BECAUSE HE'S A PREACHER. I THINK HE'S PREVAILING BECAUSE HIS MESSAGE IS RELEVANT, BECAUSE HE'S PREPARED, BECAUSE HE HAS LEGITIMATE CREDENTIALS IN THE STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE'S ASSOCIATED WITH CHURCHES. I THINK THOSE THINGS ARE WHAT GIVES HIM AN BRACE FOR US, NOT JUST TAKE THE REVEREND, OR RELIGIOUS PERSON. I THINK IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN. THAT  REVEREND, MOMENTS AGO, I INTERVIEWED PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR MY RADIO SHOW. AND PEOPLE CAN LISTEN TO THE WHOLE INTERVIEW MONDAY ON MY RADIO SHOW, REAL WITH AL SHARPTON, STARTS AT 1 PM EASTERN ON SERIOUS AND MANY BLACK STATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. I ASKED HIM ABOUT THE STAKES OF THIS ELECTION FOR BLACK AMERICANS. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.  THEY HAVE SUCH OPPORTUNITIES IF WE COULD STEP UP. MY CONCERN WITH THIS ELECTION THOUGH IS THAT IF WE DON'T LAND WE'RE GONNA WIPE OUT EVERY SINGLE -- BUT IT'S GONNA WIPE OUT. IT'S GONNA GO AWAY. IT MAKES MORE SENSE --  REVEREND, WHAT'S YOUR REACTION TO THE PRESIDENT'S COMMENTS?  I THINK HE'S ACCURATE. I'VE SAID THAT THIS MORNING IN MY RELEASES THAT WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF LOSING -- SO MUCH THAT WE'VE GAINED THE MIDTERM ELECTION. THIS IS UNLIKE ANY MIDTERM ELECTION. WE COULD LOSE SO BOTCH. OUR SENIORS COULD BE CRIPPLED BY THIS ELECTION. OUR. YOUNG PEOPLE -- PROFILING A BLACK PEOPLE, JUST ON, AND ON. SO MANY THINGS ARE EXTINCT IN THIS MIDTERM ELECTION UNLIKE ANY I'VE SEEN BEFORE IN RECENT TIMES. I THINK THAT IT'S A WARNING SIGN TO US. SUCH A RESOLVE IN SOME COMMUNITIES, A SETBACK, I THINK HE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. I THINK SO MUCH IS AT STAKE. BUT HE ALSO SAID, WE NEED HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TURN OUT, TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME. AND THAT'S WHAT WE GOTTA FOCUS ON. WE GOTTA GET EVERYBODY OUT. ON THURSDAY MORNING, WE ARE ALL TOGETHER FOR A RALLY AT THE SHERIDAN --  I GOT THE GOLD.  [INAUDIBLE]  BUT I MUST SAY, WE WERE SO INTRIGUED THAT MORNING. TO HEAR YOU SAY, WE'VE GOT TO HAVE THE FIRE OURSELVES, HE CAN'T PUT THE FIRE ON ANYBODY ELSE. WE CAN'T -- THEY DON'T HAVE THE FIRE, IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FIRE, IT'S ABOUT THE ISSUE. WE'RE NOT VOTING FOR THEM, WERE VOTING FOR OURSELVES.  AND THAT'S WHERE WE GOT NO MATTER WHAT PART YOU'RE IN. YOU NEED TO VOTE. THE FIRE IS GOTTA BE. ONIONS THANK YOU REVEREND, -- SOULS TO THE POLLS AROUND THE COUNTRY. LET'S TURN TO U.S. CONSON, WHERE THERE ARE SEVERAL HIGHLY COMPETITIVE RACES WITH THE NATIONAL IMPLICATION, DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT GOVERNOR TONY EVANS IS SEEKING REELECTION AGAINST REPUBLICAN BUSINESSMEN CLAIRE MICHAELS. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND -- MANDELA BARNES IS CHALLENGING INCUMBENT GOP SENATOR RON JOHNSON FOR THE U.S. SENATE. JOINING ME TO TALK ABOUT THOSE RACES AND MORE, IS DEMOCRATIC WISCONSIN SENATOR TAMMY BALDWIN. THANK YOU FOR JOINING ME TODAY, SENATOR.  THANK YOU REVEREND. IT'S WONDERFUL TO JOIN YOU.  WISCONSIN HAS BECOME ARGUABLY THE MOST GERRYMANDERING STATE IN THE COUNTRY. CURRENTLY WITH A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR, BUT WITH THE REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED LEGISLATURE. , AND I MERELY ADOPTED LEGISLATIVE MAP THAT FAVORS THE GOP. AND IN THESE MIDTERMS, WISCONSIN -- TO FLIP A HANDFUL OF SEATS TO GIVE THEM THE TWO THIRDS MAJORITY IN THE STATE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY. WHICH IS ALSO THE NOMINEE TO OVERRIDE VETOES BY THE GOVERNMENT. IN THIS CASE, CAN DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT GOVERNORS, TONY EVANS, WIN THE REELECTION AGAINST TRUMP ENDORSED GOP CANDIDATE TIM MICHAELS? THAT -- TO EMPLOY MANNED UNPOPULAR AGENDAS ON CONSEQUENTIAL ISSUES RANGING FROM ABORTION, VOTING RIGHTS, ELECTION INTEGRITY. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY CHAIR WAS CONSON CALLED THIS QUOTE, A THREAT TO THE FOUNDATION OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY. CAN YOU REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF WHAT'S CONSON, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON ALL OF THIS, SENATOR? , WELL IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT WE WOULD LIVE IN AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT STATE HAD WE NOT ELECTED GOVERNOR TONY ABRAMS FOUR YEARS AGO. IT'S TRUE IN THE FUTURE, WILL LIVE IN A VERY DIFFERENT STATE IF WE DO NOT REELECT HIM. -- MORE THAN ANY OTHER GOVERNOR AND MODERN HISTORY. TO PROTECT ANY NUMBER OF RIGHT, THINGS WE CHERISH, VALUE, WHETHER IT'S ACCESS TO THE BALLOT BOX, WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOMS, OBVIOUSLY, AFFECTED BY THE NATIONAL OVERTURNING OF ROE V. WADE. AND THEN GONE LAWS, ET CETERA, WE NEED TO KEEP WE NEED ENOUGH DEMOCRATS IN THE STATE LEGISLATOR TO SUSTAIN THE VETO. BUT WE NEED TO REELECT. LET. ME TELL YOU BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE AND THE U.S. SENATE RACE. WE HAVE TWO OR THREE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. OUR GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES, ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, WOULD BE -- STATE LEGISLATURE. AND WE WOULD LOSE WHAT WE VALUE AS WISCONSIN-ITES, IN THE SENATE, RACED THE SENIOR SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN, RON JOHNSON, PLEDGING TO PUT MEASURES ON -- MANDELA BARNES IS OUR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, HE'D BE AN EXTRAORDINARY PARTNER FOR ME TO BE DECIDING EVERY DAY IN THE SENATE ON BEHALF OF WISCONSIN.  -- IN JEFFERSON COUNTY. THAT REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER KNOW THE ELECTION AND WAS CONSON AFTER AN ELECTED GOVERNOR AND A. -- VETOED A RECORD SETTING 146 BELLS. -- PROBABLY CAN CONTROL OF THE LEGISLATURE. SOME OF THEM BEING A STRING OF BILLS THAT WOULD CHANGE VOTER MOVEMENTS IN A BATTLEGROUND STATE THAT DONALD TRUMP NARROWLY WON IN 2016. BUT ALSO NARROWLY LOST IN 2020. THROUGH THIS CAMPAIGN, -- SIMILAR LEGISLATION. AND HAS SAID THAT HE WOULD RESTRUCTURE THE STATE BIPARTISAN ELECTION LAWS COMMISSIONED, ELECTION COMMISSIONS. AND THAT HE WOULD TRY TO DECERTIFY, THE CERTIFY, THE 2020 ELECTION IN WISCONSIN. WHICH BY THE WAY, LEGAL SCHOLARS SAY IS IMPOSSIBLE. WHAT'S AT STAKE ON THE WEST CONSON BALLOT THIS YEAR WHEN IT COMES TO ELECTION INTEGRITY?  SO, YOU JUST NAME THAT. WE HAVE TO EXTREME REPUBLICANS, ONE RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR, ONE IS A U.S. SENATOR. WHO EMBRACE THE BIG LIE, WHO HAD ENDORSED STEPS THAT WOULD MAKE IT EASY TO INTERFERE LET NEUTRAL ELECTION. WHETHER THEIR EXTREME VIEWS ARE MEANT TO SUPPRESS CURRENT VOTE, OR TO LITERALLY PASS ON THE AUTHORITY TO -- OUTCOME OF ELECTIONS RATHER THAN VOTERS. WAS CONSON-ITES NEED TO KNOW, THAT MICHAEL JOHNSON -- REALLY EMBRACE THE BIG LIE. AND AND CHASE MICHAELS HAS THREATENED TO SIGN A BILL DECERTIFYING THE LAST ELECTION. WITH REGARD TO RON JOHNSON AS YOU KNOW, HE WAS TRYING TO BRING TO FALSE PLATES OF ELECTORAL BALLOTS TO THE VICE PRESIDENT ON JANUARY SIX. SO, WE NEED TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT WHO WE WILL ELECT. THANK GOODNESS WE HAVE GOVERNOR TONY ABRAMS. AND LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR MATT DELLA BARNES RUNNING FOR THE U.S. SENATE.  ALL RIGHT, I NEED TO LEAVE IT THERE. THANK YOU TAMMY BALDWIN FOR BEING WITH US. UP NEXT, MY FINAL THOUGHT. IT'S TIME TO RISE UP FOR REAL. 20221106225129.151|20221106225506.169",

THE MEASURES GIVING ABORTION RIGHTS AND ADVOCATES A CHANCE TO APPEAL DIRECTLY TO VOTERS AFTER THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNED ROE V. WADE. MORE THAN A QUARTER OF WOMEN AGES 15 TO 44 LIVE IN STATES WHERE ABORTION IS BANNED OR MOSTLY BANNED. ALSO ON THE BALLOT IN SEVEN STATES, MEASURED ON. VOTING NEVADA IS DECIDING WHETHER TO ESTABLISH RANK CHOICE VOTING IN CERTAIN ELECTIONS. VOTERS IN OHIO AND LOUISIANA ARE CONSIDERING WHETHER TO PROHIBIT NON CITIZENS FROM VOTING IN THE ELECTION. IN ARIZONA AND NEVADA MORE STRICT VOTER I.D. REQUIREMENTS ARE ON THE BALLOT AND IN CONNECTICUT WE WILL SEE A VOTE ON A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO ALLOW IN PERSON EARLY VOTING. MICHIGANDERS WILL DECIDE WHETHER THEY WANT NINE DAYS OF EARLY VOTING PLUS PREPAID SYSTEM FOR TRACKING ABSENTEE BALLOTS. JOINING ME NOW IS HOWARD SCENE, FORMER GOVERNOR OF VERMONT AND DNC CHAIR. GOOD TO SEE, YOU FRIEND. I WANT TO GET US RUNNING WITH SIMON ROSENBERG, WHO IS TWEETED THIS. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE EARLY VOTING IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION STORY RIGHT NOW. HE MOVES ON TO SAY WHAT WE ARE NOT SEEING AS A RED WAVE. THAT IS ANOTHER NEW TWEET HE WRITES WE NOW KNOW OR WE KNOW NOW THAT THERE IS A LEGIT BLUE WAY. WILL HE READ ONE BE BIGGER? WE WILL SEE. DO YOU THINK HE'S RIGHT? ARE YOU FEELING CONFIDENT THE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO WIN AND KEEP CONTROL OF CONGRESS?  MY PREDICTION FOR THE LAST MONTH OR SO IS THAT IT WILL PICK UP AT LEAST TWO SEATS IN THE SENATE WILL PICK UP TWO SEATS IN THE HOUSE. SO HOW MUCH CONCEPT THERE IS WHO KNOWS. IT'S A TOUGH BUSINESS AND ELECTION THESE DAYS. SOME PEOPLE DIDN'T LIKE HIM.  WHAT ABOUT TUESDAY NIGHT. LET'S LOOK AT THE POLL. SOME OF HIM FOR THE STATE GEORGIA AND HAND NEW HAMPSHIRE. 7:30 PENNSYLVANIA 8 PM. TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AS THE RESULTS COME IN. WHAT INDICATES TO YOU, HOWARD, WHETHER THERE IS GOING TO BE A BLUE SURPRISE OR A RED WAVE.  THE BIG SURPRISE TO ME IS NOT WEATHER -- WHEN THE POLLS CLOSE BUT WHEN THE VOTES ARE COUNTED AND WHAT COMES IN FIRST. SO THE PROBLEM IS IN GEORGIA YOU ARE LIKELY TO SEE ATLANTA VOTES COME IN FIRST, WHICH ARE OBVIOUSLY GOING TO SKEWER NORMALLY TOWARDS SENATOR WARNOCK AND SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO KNOW BECAUSE WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING IS AS THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION MENTIONED A TURNOUT IS GOING TO BE ENORMOUS WHEN THERE IS NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THERE IS GOING TO BE ENORMOUS TURNOUT AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE AND PARTICULARLY WOMEN. PARTICULARLY AMONG VOTERS OF COLOR ALL OF WHICH IS GOING TO FAVOR THE DEMOCRATS. THE QUESTION MY MIND IS HOW BREAK IS THE TRUMP TURNOUT AND THAT WOULD JUST ANSWER TO. SO IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG NIGHT. THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT. IT  ABSOLUTELY A LONG NIGHT IN THE NIGHT GOES ON INTO THE WANING HOURS. POLLS CLOSING AT 9 PM AND IN WISCONSIN AS WELL AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE POLLS IN NEVADA CLOSING AT 10 PM EASTERN TIME. TOP OF MIND, AND THAT POINT OF THE NIGHT, WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR?  I AM LOOKING FOR CLEAR EVIDENCE OF REELECTION BY A FAIR AMOUNT. GOVERNOR IN MICHIGAN. I'M LOOKING IN MINNESOTA AND WISCONSIN. THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT AND THE REPUBLICANS ARE POISED TO TRY TO TAKE POWER. THEY HAVE INCREDIBLY BAD CANDIDATES AND ALL THOSE THINGS. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN DEMOCRACY. I'M INTERESTED IN THAT. I'M VERY INTERESTED IN A TURN OUT. THAT IS WHAT I'M MOST INTERESTED IN. BECAUSE I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THE TURNOUT AND THE NUMBERS HE PUT UP EARLIER JUST AS YOU WERE TEASING ME IN THIS SECTION ARE CREDIBLE FOR DEMOCRATS. SOMEONE ROSENBERG IS RIGHT. I DO HAVE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN AND YOUNG PEOPLE VOTING WHO VOTED SO FAR, THAT IS VERY GOOD NEWS FOR US.  -- ARE THEY BY THE PERFORMANCES THE ROCK STAR PERFORMANCES BY FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND -- UNDER THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. DO YOU THINK THAT REALLY PULLS NO ONE OF THOSE? IT GENERATES ENTHUSIASM CERTAINLY.  THAT WILL. BUT THAT IS NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE TURNOUT NUMBERS. WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN WHAT PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED WITH'S EARLY VOTING. IT OBVIOUSLY HELPS TO HAVE BARACK OBAMA ON THE STUMP AND ARRESTING THE GROUP. HE ENERGIZES TO WIN TWO TERMS OF THE PRESIDENCY. AND IT IS GOING TO HELP DETERMINE WHO I THINK IS NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY TROUBLE IN THIS RACE. ALTHOUGH I WANT EVERYBODY WAS LISTENING TO GET INFO TO MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE. I THINK THAT THE REALLY INTERESTING ONE TO WATCH WHICH I DID NOT EXPECT NECESSARILY WAS GOING TO BE CHERI BEASLEY WHO WAS LIKELY GOING TO WIN IN NORTH CAROLINA. BUT AS I SEE THAT I DID NOT SEE COMING OUR WAY BUT I THINK IT WILL SO THOSE ARE ALL THE THINGS YOU HAVE TO WATCH BECAUSE YOU'VE TO WATCH WHO IS TURNING OUT AND HOW BIG THEY ARE TURNING OUT. I THINK IF WE SEE A BIG TURNOUT IN RURAL AREAS THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. I DON'T THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE BE A BIG TURNOUT IN RURAL AREAS BUT WE WILL FIND OUT.  WHAT ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE IN OUR BACKYARD IN 30 ROCK? PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS SHOWN WESTCHESTER COUNTY TO RALLY WITH GOVERNOR HOCHUL WHO IS IN A TIGHT RACE. HOW SURPRISING IS THAT THAT THE PRESIDENT HAS TO STOP TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION IN A NEW YORK CITY SUBURB RATHER THAN IN SOME TRADITIONAL BATTLEGROUND? WHAT IS NOT TELLING YOU?  THAT'S A MYTH LITTLE MISLEADING. NOT THE OR MISLEADING PERSON. BUT PEOPLE WHO MAKE THAT KIND OF INTERPRETATION OR BASICALLY HACKED JOURNALISTS. IT'S A GREAT STORY AND IT IS NONSENSE. IT IS A CLOSE RACE. IT IS CLOSER THAN EXPECTED. HOCHUL STILL HAS A HEALTHY LEAD YOU BETTER GET AND HOPE FOR, IT'S UNTHINKABLE. THE REAL REASON THAT BIDEN IS IN NEW YORK IS IT'S POPULAR NEW YORK DID NOT TO PLACES THAT HE'S CAMPAIGNING. HE HAS TO GO CAMPAIGNING IN PLACES WHERE HE'S NOT EVEN 40%. -- IT IS OVER 50. THE REASON IS TO GUIDE IS BECAUSE IT IS A REAL VOTE TO TURN OR OTHER HE DOESN'T THINK THERE WILL BE A GAME IN PLACES WHERE HE IS UNDERWATER.  YOU ARE PROTECTING THE HOCHUL IS GOING TO WIN, BUT HOW MUCH IS A MARGIN BY WHICH HE WIN COUNT? I THINK THE SCORE TODAY WAS 6.2%. HE IS A LEAD OVER LEAD THERE. UNTIL YOU, WHAT SHE PROBABLY WILL WIN. BUT HOW IMPORTANT IS IT THAT SHE IS A HEFTY MARGIN?  THE ONLY REASON IT IS IMPORTANT FOR TYLER HEFTY MARGIN IS THAT MAKES NO DEAL FOR GOVERNORSHIP. THE REASON IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IS THAT THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE DRAMATIC SITES WHICH ARE UP FOR GRABS AND CLOSER THAN EXPECTED. IF SHE GETS A BIG TURNOUT AND A BIG MARGIN JOE PULL THOSE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE INTO THE RACE. THE RACE IN NEW YORK WAS THROWN UP IN THE AIR BY A JUDGE WHO HAD TO RE-DISTRICT IN A MOST UNUSUAL WAY. -- JUST WOULDN'T GIVE AN INCH AND FINALLY THE JUDGE WILL SAY THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND FAVORING THE DEMOCRATS IT TOO MUCH. THERE IS A HOLD OF NEW PEOPLE IN NEW DISTRICTS. WHEN I THINK IF KATHY HOCHUL WINS BY SIX OR EIGHT OR 10% SHE'S GONNA BRING A LOT OF THOSE PEOPLE INTO CONGRESS, AND THEY'LL BE VERY HELPFUL.  OKAY. HOWARD DEAN ALWAYS HELPFUL. A LONG NIGHT TUESDAY, THANK YOU.  IT'S ALL ABOUT MIDTERMS ON AN MSNBC, BEGINNING AT SEVEN EASTERN, INCLUDING A ONE HOUR MORNING JOE SPECIAL. THAT IS THAT. NINE FIELD REPORT WITH PAULA RAMOS, THAT'S IT. TEN, THEN ALL TONIGHT HERE ON MSNBC. IT IS A STATE WITH AN INCREDIBLY TIGHT SENATE RACE. VOTERS ARE SPEAKING OUT ABOUT THE BIGGEST ISSUE ON THEIR MIND.  THE BORDER. THE ECONOMY. THE ECONOMY IS KILLING ME. IT'S KILLING ME. PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THING.  I HAVE MY OWN BUSINESS. AND BETWEEN THE INFLATION AND -- THE SUPPLY CHAIN STUFF IT'S JUST KILLED ME.

WE STAND TOGETHER, WE STAYED TOGETHER WE CAN GET THIS THING WORKED OUT. WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE TO SEE TEAM IN. THE C TEAM IS LYING TO YOU.  I THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO WIN BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE VERY FRUSTRATED WITH THE DIRECTION OF OUR COUNTRY.  WE HAVE BEEN EVERYWHERE. I AM TELLING YOU, WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS RACE.  ALL YOU HAPPY WITH THE WAY AMERICA IS GOING? IF YOU SAY YES, YOU PUT THE CAR KEYS AWAY. YOU SHOULD NOT BE DRIVING IN THAT POSITION. WE HAVE TWO PRESIDENTS -- OUR NEXT GOVERNOR,, AND WE ARE ALL 100% --  CANDIDATES THERE FROM KEY BATTLEGROUND RACES GIVING CLOSING MESSAGES TO VOTERS THIS WEEKEND. WE ARE NOW TWO DAYS AWAY FROM THE INTERACTIONS. JOINING ME NOW IS JOHN CALLOWAY, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST AND FOUNDER OF THE NATIONAL VOTER PROTECTION FUND. A REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, A FORMER REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FROM FLORIDA. DAVID JOLLY, MSNBC POLITICAL ANALYST, AND MY SUNDAY FAMILY. GLAD YOU GUYS ARE HERE -- LET'S START WITH THE EARLY VOTING NUMBERS. MORE THAN 40 MILLION CAST ALREADY. DEMOCRATS LEAD, PERCENTAGE WISE. DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER, SIMON ROSENBERG IS SAYING THAT HIS PARTY'S STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE EARLY VOTING IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION STORY RIGHT NOW. THERE'S ANOTHER TRUE WHEAT IN WHICH HE SAYS THAT, WE KNOW NOW, RATHER, WE NOW KNOW THERE IS A LEGIT BLUE WAVE. WILL THE READ ONE BE BIGGER? WE WILL SEE. DON, IS HE ON TO SOMETHING THAT NO ONE IS SEEING? OR IS HE PUTTING TOO MUCH STOCK INTO THE EARLY VOTE? GIVE US YOUR READ ON IT.  THE EARLY BEAU BEING HIGH FOR DEMOCRATS [INAUDIBLE] AND WANT TO DISSECT THAT. ALL I KNOW IS DEMOCRATS WHO ARE OVERWHELMINGLY BLACK HAVE GONE TO VOTE EARLY I DON'T KNOW IT IS THE BLOWOUTS THAT REPUBLICANS WERE LOOKING FOR. THERE ARE THE INDICATION THAT VOTERS ARE INFORMED WHETHER IT WAS BY MAIL OR EARLY VOTING. THERE IS NO UNIVERSE IN WHICH A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF DEMOCRATIC EARLY PARTICIPATION IS BAD FOR THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. WE WILL SEE ARMED MILITIAS POLL WATCHING ON THE RIGHT ON TUESDAY I THINK IT IS ALWAYS BEST THAT PEOPLE PARTICIPATE BEFORE TUESDAY. ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN ON ELECTION DAY. THERE IS NO UNIVERSAL --  LISTENS, MY FRIEND. DO ME A FAVOR. SCOOCH UP A LITTLE CLOSER SO WE SEE HERE YOU MORE CLEARLY. I'M GOING TO SEASON SO YOU HAVE A MOMENT TO DO THAT. WOMEN ARE LEADING MAN IN THE EARLY VOTING PERCENTAGE. HOW MUCH IS A MOTIVATING FACTOR IS THE ISSUE OF ABORTION AS WE HEAD INTO TUESDAY, TUESDAY? HOW BIG OF A ROLE DO YOU THINK THAT WOMEN VOTED WILL PLAY IN DETERMINING THE ROLE OF CONGRESS?  IT IS CERTAINLY A MOTIVATING ISSUE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE ISSUES WITH SUBURBAN WOMEN, IT IS A NUMBER ONE ISSUE. IT IS A VERY GOOD SIGN FOR DEMOCRATS THAT WOMEN ARE TURNING OUT EARLY. VOTING AND I THINK THEY WILL BE MOTIVATED, TO SOME EXTENT, COULD IT BE THE MARGIN OF DIFFERENCE? YES, WELL THAT LEAVE A WAVE? I DON'T THINK SO THE QUESTION, DAVID HOW INDICATIVE ARE EARLY VOTING NUMBERS TO WHAT WE ULTIMATELY SEE PLAY OUT ON ELECTION DAY? ? WHAT DO YOU WATCH FOR THAT MIGHT SUGGEST YOU A RED WAVE OR A BLUE SUPPLIES?  THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DRAW FROM THAT -- IS HIGH TURNOUT OR LOW TURNOUT. THIS IS AN EARLY PREDICTOR. VERY IMPORTANTLY THE ONLY WAY TO MEASURE CURRENT TURNOUT THAT YOU ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW IS AMONG AMONG THOSE THAT ARE NOT REGISTERED IN THE ALREADY MANY STATES IT CAN BE 30% OF THE VOTERS AS WELL AS YOUR LOW TO MEDIUM VOTERS -- THOSE VOTERS WHO MAY OR MAY NOT VOTE ALL THE TIME, WHEN TUESDAY NIGHT THOSE TO COME DOWN TO THOSE TWO BLOCKS. THE LOW TO MEDIUM PROPENSITY VOTERS. ARE WE GOING TO SEE PEOPLE TAKE NOTICE OF THIS ELECTION? THE ABORTION ISSUE, THE ECONOMY, OR JOE BIDEN'S APPROVAL NUMBERS? IT IS REALLY BROKEN DOWN TO THESE INTERSECTIONS OF HOW LIKELY ARE LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS TO VOTE? UPON WHAT ISSUE ARE THEY BEING MOTIVATED? THE ECONOMY ABORTION THAT INTERSECTION COULD DECIDE A LAW ON TUESDAY NIGHT.  MIGHT IT BE THE PROSPECT OF THE DAMAGE TO OUR DEMOCRACY IF THINGS GO THE WRONG WAY? OUR POLL OUT TODAY SAID THAT WAS TOP OF MIND IT WAS PRETTY SURPRISING GIVING WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES. EARLY TURNOUT IN GEORGIA BREAKING RECORDS. MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF MILLION VOTES HAVE BEEN CAST. NBC'S EARLY VOTE TRACKER SHOWS THE DEMOCRAT LEAD IN EARLY VOTING PERCENTAGE. HOW SIGNIFICANT OF AN ADVANTAGE YOU THINK THIS COULD BE FOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK AND STACEY ABRAMS? VERY SIGNIFICANT. REMEMBER, THIS IS THE STATE THAT HAD THE WORST OF THE VOTER SUPPRESSION LAWS THE WAY IN LINE STUFF THE QUOTE ON QUOTE, BRING A BOTTLE OF WATER. EVERYBODY AND GEORGIA HAS REALLY ORGANIZED THEY ARE READY FOR ELECTION DAY. THAT IS A GOOD THING IT I'M SAD TO REPORT I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS A LOT WITH MY CONVERSATION LAST WEEK THERE ARE A LOT OF BLACK FOLKS UNFORTUNATELY ARE GOING TO VOTE FOR HERSCHEL WALKER. -- [INAUDIBLE] HE SOUNDS AND LOOKS LIKE A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE THAT REAL BLACK FOLKS KNOW IN GEORGIA. SO, THERE IS GONNA BE A LOT OF SPLIT TICKETING BETWEEN FOLKS WHO DON'T WANT TO VOTE FOR HERSCHEL WALKER. I SEE THAT RACE GOING TO RUNOFF. IT IS GONNA BE SOME NASTY STUFF COMING FROM BOTH SIDES. MOSTLY THE REPUBLICAN SIDE IN THE TWO MONTHS BETWEEN NOW AND THAT RUNOFF ELECTION.  FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THE RUNOFF PRODUCTION IS BEING PRETTY FIRST.  SUSAN SAID IT LAST WEEK AND I THINK SHE WAS RIGHT. I THOUGHT ABOUT IT A LOT I DIDN'T GIVE YOU CREDIT I'M SORRY. LET ME GIVE YOU CREDIT PRESIDENT BIDEN IS HEADING TO NEW YORK LIBERAL NEW YORK TO RALLY WITH NEW YORK GOVERNOR, KATHY HOLCOMB WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU HE'S GOING TO ONE OF THE MOST BLUE STATES IN THE COUNTRY IT'S TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION HE IS NOT SPENDING THIS AFTERNOON IN ANOTHER BATTLEGROUND THERE TO TELL YOU THE GUBERNATORIAL RACE IS CLOSER THAN THEY WOULD LIKE IT TO BE? WE HAVE HEARD THIS RAISE, WE KEEP THINKING IT IS PROBABLY AN 8 TO 10 POINT RACE BUT SEEING THE PRESIDENT COME IN AN ELECTION DAY WEEKEND'S STUNNING IT MAKES ME THINK MAYBE THE INTERNAL NUMBERS FOR THE CAMPAIGN -- IT IS WITHIN THREE OR FOUR POINTS BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER REASON FOR THE PRESIDENT TO COME EXCEPT TO MAKE THAT MARGIN OF DIFFERENCE AND VOTER TURNOUT. THE OTHER THING I SEE IS UNION SUPPORT. IT USED TO BE THE BREAD AND BUTTER FOR DEMOCRATS TO GET OUT THERE AND VOTE. THERE HAS BEEN VIRTUALLY NONE OF IT I WOULD LIKE TO ADD, I AM WITH YOU ALICE, I HAVE NEVER SEEN SOME MONEY POLES IN THE NEW YORK MARKET DISLIKE HOME. I AM DON.  ME TOO! I CANNOT WAIT FOR WEDNESDAY. LET'S GO, DAVID, TO TALK ABOUT DOCTOR OZ. HE APPEARED WITH FORMER PRESIDENT DOCTOR -- SO, IF YOU ARE DR. OZ. YOU ARE FIGHTING FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD INDEPENDENTS IN PENNSYLVANIA FOR THESE LAST DAYS DO YOU REALLY WANT DONALD TRUMP AS A LAST-MINUTE MESSENGER? IS THAT A WINNING STRATEGY FOR YOU?  I, LIKE MY FAMILY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A HOME IN PENNSYLVANIA. WE ARE SPENDING THE LAST FEW WEEKS OF THE ELECTION HERE I'LL TELL YOU THIS, NO ONE BELIEVED LAST MONTH METHOD THAT I WANT TO BE THE MODERATE TO SENSIBLE CONSENSUS MAKER. THAT IS NOT HIM, THAT IS NOT HOW HE ENTERED THE RACE. NOT HOW HE FINANCED THE RACE. I THINK AT THIS POINT, YOU SEE IT ON THE RIGHT IN THE LEFT. TRY FOR AS MUCH TURNOUT. I ASKED HIM TO BRING TEN FRIENDS. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE SEEING FROM THE TRUMP RALLY. WE CANNOT OVERLOOK, BASSE REESE HAVE BEEN ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. NOT ABOUT DOCTOR OZ. LAST NIGHT WAS ABOUT DONALD TRUMP SAYING, DON'T LOOK AT ANYBODY BUT ME. I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT NOW, WATCH ME.  HOW UNUSUAL. HE NEVER DOES THAT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. SOME EARLY DISCUSSIONS AND SOME FREQUENT COMMUNICATION WITH FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING THAT, HE ACTUALLY CONSIDERED LAST NIGHT'S RALLY IN PENNSYLVANIA HAS THE PLACE TO ANNOUNCE A PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN 2024. WE ALSO SENT HIS ADVISERS TOLD HIM NOT TO DO IT, SAYING IT WOULD TAKE FOCUS AWAY FROM THE CANDIDATES THAT ARE ON THE BALLOT ON TUESDAY. GIVE ME YOUR REACTION. WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT DONALD TRUMP THAT HE IS ITCHING TO ANNOUNCE? I THINK IT SAYS THAT, AS DAVID POINTED OUT A MOMENT AGO, HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT ANY OF THESE CANDIDATES. HE IS SOLIDIFYING HIS SUPPORT FOR WHEN HE GETS READY TO DO IT. WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FOR A COUPLE YEARS NOW WITH THIS GROUP, HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF RAISING MONEY. PARTICULARLY AS THE -- MORE DISTRESSED UNDER VARIOUS LEGAL ISSUES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. HE ALSO BELIEVES THAT HE IS A STUNT TO BE RUNNING. HE CANNOT MOVE AWAY FROM PENNSYLVANIA AND FLORIDA. LET'S DOUBLE DOWN ON TRYING TO BUILD A STRONG BASE. REMINDING ME, REMINDING US THAT PENNSYLVANIA IS WHO I AM. I AM THERE AS A LEADER. HE PROBABLY, MAYBE, CANNOT BE RHONDA SCENT IS DOWN IN FLORIDA. HE CANNOT WAIT HIS WAY BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE IF HE LOSES BOTH OF THOSE.  DONALD TRUMP, VERY QUICKLY, IF HE DOES ANNOUNCE WHAT WE ONLY BE TALKING ABOUT WHOSE RUNNING MATE IS GOING TO BE?  I THINK HE WOULD FILE THE PAPERS HE WILL MAKE AN ANNOUNCEMENT I'M GUESSING THAT HE WON'T BE ON THE BALLOT ALL OF THE SPECULATION WILL COME IT WILL NOT FILING THE PAPER SAYS A LOT. I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT ONE. WHAT ABOUT YOU DAVID?  ALEX, I AM EXCEEDINGLY CLOSE TO THE STORY. WHAT I WOULD TELL YOU I'VE SUSPECTED THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL CALL IT A FOX NEWS ON ELECTION NIGHT AND ANNOUNCED FOR 24 HE HAS TO OWN THAT HEADLINE THE MEDIA HAS TO REPORT THAT COME WEDNESDAY MORNING THE REASON WHY HE HAS TO DISRUPT RON DESANTIS'S RAPID ACCELERATION. THE DESANTIS CAMP IS CONFIDENT ON TAKING HIM ON. THEY ARE ALREADY STUDYING EARLY STATE PRIMARIES TO DETERMINE THE STRATEGY FOR BEATING DONALD TRUMP HAD TO HEAD. I THINK THIS WILL BE A MATCH TO MATCH THAT UP.  I'M ASKING YOU TO FILE THE PAPERWORK TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL?  I DON'T THINK HE NEEDS TO FOR A WHILE. I DON'T THINK ROD DESANTIS NEEDS TO FOR A WHILE ONCE THEY EXPRESSED THEIR INTENT IT WILL BE REPORTED THE TWO OF THEM ARE RUNNING AGAINST EACH OTHER.  OTHERWISE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS. THANKS A LONG NIGHT ON TUESDAY. WE WILL SEE YOU ALL NEXT WEEKEND. ALSO COMING UP, WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS AND HOW IT PLAYS IN WASHINGTON.

KARI LAKE IS ONE OF THOSE THAT STILL DISPUTES THE 2020 ELECTION.  I THINK THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE CURRENT ATMOSPHERE IN THIS COUNTRY IS VERY TENSE.

BUT CAN YOU PUT A BOUNCE TO? IT IS IT 50/50. HOW DO YOU TURN DOWN THE HEAT?  HE TURNED DOWN THE HEAT BY ADMITTING THAT OUR ELECTIONS ARE WELL RUN, FIRST AND FOREMOST. THAT IS HOW YOU TURN DOWN THE HEAT AND GIVE VOTERS THE CONFIDENCE IN THE POLLS. ONE OF THE WEIRD THINGS FROM THE STRATEGY BY THE RIGHT IS YOU SAY THE ELECTIONS ARE BADLY RUN BUT YOU ARE STILL TRYING TO DRAW PEOPLE OUT TO THE POLLS AND GET THEM TO COME OUT TO VOTE. THE DISCONNECT THAT IS REQUIRED TO SAY THE ELECTION OVERALL WAS POORLY RUN BUT I WON MY ELECTION THE LACK OF GOOD RHETORIC HOW DO YOU BREAK IT DOWN I'M SORRY ONLY ONE SIDE IS OUT THERE IN TACKLE GEAR AND GUNS TRYING TO INTIMIDATE. INTIMIDATION IS ONE OF THE LEAST AFFECT WAYS POSSIBLE. IF THEY WERE REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT HOW VALID SECURITY WORKS AND HOW THESE DROPBOX'S WORK THEY WOULD REALIZE THAT THEY ARE GAINING NOTHING BY STANDING OUT HERE IN WATCHING THESE THE WAY THAT BALLOTS ARE ACTUALLY COUNTED AND KEPT TRACK OF MATCHED TO VOTER REGISTRATION THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS BEING DONE IN THESE CLIPS THAT YOU'RE SHOWING THAT WOULD PREVENT AN OUNCE OF VOTER FRAUD THAT OCCURRED I THINK YOU WOULD HONESTLY HAVE TO BREAK IT DOWN TO 80 20 OF THE PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT AND THE FAR-RIGHT TRYING TO INTIMIDATE VOTERS AND CATCH DOUBT ON OUR ELECTION. ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO PUSH BACK AND FIGHT BACK AND WANT TO DO SOMETHING TO PROTECT DEMOCRACY.  80 20 SOUNDS LIKE AN INTERESTING NUMBER. WHAT DO THEY GET OUT OF IT? THEY GOT TO ACT LIKE THEY ARE BIG SHOTS. THEY GET TO TELL THEIR FRIENDS, LOOK WHAT I DID. BUT THAT IS FOR A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. THE ELECTION WORKERS WITH VIEWS RECOUNTED -- THEY FACE MORE THAN 100 VIOLENT THREATS AND IT IMITATING COMMUNICATION. 18 VOTERS HAVE NOW FILED COMPLAINTS TO VAUGHN FORSMAN SAYING, WE WERE INDEED INTIMIDATED AT THE POLLS. ELECTION WORKERS AND VOTERS UNDER THREAT, RICK! WHAT DO WE NEED TO BE LOOKING OUT FOR COME TUESDAY IN THIS REGARD?  I THINK THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GONNA HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE FREE AND UNFETTERED ACCESS TO THE POLLS. POLL WORKERS, ELECTION WORKERS, ARE PROTECTED. WE REMEMBER WHEN THE VOTES ARE BEING COUNTED IN ARIZONA IN 2020. THERE WAS A MOB OUTSIDE OF SOME OF THESE ELECTION OFFICES. THE TRUMP RHETORIC OF THE STOLEN ELECTION HAS MOVED THINGS TO A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE HERE IN THIS COUNTRY. EVEN ELECTION WORKERS FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY. MANY OF THEM LEAVING THEIR JOBS AND THAT CREATES A WHOLE OTHER PROBLEM WITH ELECTION CONFIDENCE.  YOU CALL IT TRUMP RHETORIC BUT I THINK MANY WOULD CALL IT JUST FLAT OUT TRUMP LIES. IT HAS BEEN CALLED THE BIG LIE AS YOU WELL KNOW THE COURTS BEING THE ONLY THING HOLDING BACK TOTAL ELECTION SUBVERSION. HOW WILL THIS ELATION TEST THE SYSTEM OF THE STATE FEDERAL COURT?  THE BIGGEST THING I'M LOOKING FOR ASIDE FROM POTENTIAL DISRUPTIONS ON TUESDAY, ARE WE GOING TO BE ELECTING PEOPLE TO OFFICE WHO SAID THAT THE LAST ELECTION WAS STOLEN? IF THEY ARE ELECTED, WILL WE BE ABLE TO TRUST THEM TO RUN ELECTIONS FAIRLY IN 2024? IF NOT, WHO IS GOING TO PROTECT US? THAT IS WHY I ARGUE IN MY PIECE IN THE ATLANTIC THAT REALLY IT HAS TO BE STAY IN FEDERAL COURTS TO STEP UP? THE ELECTION SUBVERSION IS AVOIDED. THAT THE WINNER OF THE ELECTION THE PERSON WITH THE VOTES THAT WILL HAVE TO FALL THROUGH THE STATE ELECTION. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES IN TODAY'S MSNBC POLL, THE THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. THAT LANDS AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. HEY, YOU WRITE THAT NOT EVERYONE CATEGORIZES THIS THREAT IN THE SAME WAY. MAGA CROWDS DISHONEST COUNTER POINT BIDEN'S PLEA TO DEMOCRACY, AS YOU CALLED IT? PLEA TTHIS ACTIVE, THEY ARE USIG SUCH SIMILAR LANGUAGE ON THE RIGHT AND ELECT IN TERMS OF THE THREAT TO DEMOCRACY, THE THREAT TO AMERICA, A THREAT TO A WAY OF LIFE. IT IS HARD TO PARSE THAT OUT IN POLLING, RIGHT? HE ASKED SOMEONE -- AS THE NEW YORK TIMES RECENTLY DID, DO YOU BELIEVE THAT DEMOCRACY IS AT RISK IN AMERICA? BOTH SIDES SAY, YES! A LARGE DEGREE TO THE SAME AMOUNT. 71% IN THE NEW YORK TIMES POLL. THEY SAID YES, DEMOCRACY IS UNDER THREAT. THEY PUSH FURTHER AND ASK, WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY? EACH SIDE SAYING THE OTHER. ONE SIDE THE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THE ACT OF PEOPLE LIKE TRUMP. LYING, TRYING TO CHANGE THE RULES. TO INSTALL CANDIDATES -- THE REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT THE MAC ALLY'S THE ELECTION FRAUD IS HAPPENING THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SHOULDN'T BE VOTING THAT ARE VOTING AND THAT IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY. THE POLL WHAT I FOUND FASCINATING WE ASKED A QUESTION, WHAT IS THE BIGGER RISK? PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ALLOWED TO VOTE ACTUALLY CASTING A BALLOT OR PEOPLE WHO ARE ALLOWED TO VOTE OR BEING PREVENTED FROM DOING SO? THAT CAME DOWN TO ALMOST THE EXACT SPLIT. 46 TO 46, SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AMERICANS AREN'T SURE THE IDEA OF FRAUD -- OR THE IDEA. WE HAVE SEEN THAT HAPPEN AGAIN, AND AGAIN. THAT GAP IS MUCH WIDER. IT IS GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR THIS COUNTRY.  RICK HANSON, GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH. ABORTION IS ON THE BOW IN FIVE STATES. IN SOME OF THE VOTERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE AGAINST DISCRIMINATION OF WOMEN THREATS TO. THAT IS NEXT. THE CRIME, LAST NIGHT'S MASS SHOOTING IN PHILADELPHIA RANKS ONLY AS THE SIX MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR VOTERS IN TODAY'S MSNBC POLL. GUNS, JUST NINTH. THAT SHOOTING WHICH WANTED NINE PEOPLE RAISES THE YEARS TOLD ON MY SHOOTINGS IN THIS COUNTRY TO A STAGGERING 583. WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO MAKE PEOPLE CARE? 20221106175257.691|20221106175442.062",

ONE OF THE VOTERS TELLING YOU TODAY? I WAS JUST AT A CAMPAIGN EVENT THIS CHURCH BEHIND ME THAT IS WHEN TO DIXON WAS IN THE CROWD -- GETTING AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY EVENT THE CHURCH SAY THEY WERE GATHERED HERE TODAY TO DESTROY PLAYERS YOU CAN REALLY SEE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL HOW RELIGION AND POLITICS IS REALLY INTERSECTING. THAT IS ALSO BECAUSE PROPOSAL ON SITE IN MICHIGAN. DEMOCRATS SAY THIS WILL HELP THEM. THE ALTERNATIVE TO THE 1931 RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAW THAT WOULD CRIMINALIZE ANY ABORTION WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION. REPUBLICANS, ON THE OTHER HAND, THINK EVANGELICALS AND CHRISTIANS WILL SHOW UP TO FIGHT IT. THE PASTOR IN THIS CHURCH BEHIND ME SAID HE WAS FASTING UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION. THAT IS HOW IMPORTANT ISSUE IS TO HIM. I ALSO SPOKE WITH MANY PRO-LIFE DEMOCRATS, INCLUDING ONE YOU WILL HEAR FROM LATER ON TODAY, THEY TOLD ME THAT SHE BELIEVED IN EXCEPTIONS. LISTEN TO TWO WOMEN THAT I SPOKE TO BEFORE COMING HERE.  THE IMPORTANT THING TO ME WOULD BE A WOMAN'S RIGHTS -- PRIMARILY. HUMAN RIGHTS IN GENERAL. TREATING EVERYONE YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TREATED. THINGS LIKE THAT. JUST BEING A GOOD PERSON. IF YOU COULD TRY TO GET SOME SORT OF BALANCE WHERE WE CAN ADDRESS ALL THE DIFFERENT ISSUES AND HOPEFULLY MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE.  I THINK ROE BEING OVERTURNED IS GONNA MAKE A LOT OF WOMEN AND YOUNGER PEOPLE TURN OUT TO VOTE. I JUST WANTED TO GET IN EARLY AND MAKE SURE MY VOTE WAS COUNTED.  I THINK PEOPLE GO RIGHT TO THE MICHIGAN ABORTION BAN. THEY WANT TO TAKE IT COMPLETELY OFF THE TABLE. I THINK PEOPLE ARE JUST ANGRY. A LOT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE I TALKED TO -- I WISH THEY WERE ANGRY ABOUT IT. I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE TABLE. I THINK ABORTION SHOULD BE -- POLITICIANS MADE IT VERY CLEAR WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ABORTIONS WE DON'T KNOW WE HAVE NO EXCEPTION I THINK PEOPLE GOING OUT THE VOTE JUST FOR THAT. ALEX WE ARE IN MACOMB COUNTY. THIS IS THE SITE IT'S WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP WON IN 2016 AND 2020. BEFORE THAT IT WAS KNOWN AS AN AREA OF REAGAN DEMOCRATS CLEARLY ABOUT A GROUND FOR THESE INDEPENDENT VOTERS A VERY DIFFERENT SCENE HERE TODAY THAN WHAT WE SAW ON THE TRAIL WITH GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WOODWARD AND DETROIT THAT IS ALL FOCUSED ON DEMOCRACY, ABORTION RIGHTS, TUTOR DIXON WHO HUNTER SPOKE TO TOLD ME SHE IS FOCUSING ON SCHOOLS EDUCATION AND INFLATION HEADING INTO THE FINAL TWO DAYS.  OKAY JULIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. ALSO FOR THE PENDULUM SWINGING IN THAT COUNTY. I APPRECIATE IT.

        "trs": "GOOD EVENING AND WELCOME TO POLITICSNATION. AMERICA DECIDES. . OR RIGHT NOW WITH THREE DAYS LEFT UNTIL THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS, A DEEPLY DIVIDED AMERICA IS PREPARING TO CAST FINAL BALLOTS. THE DISTANCE BETWEEN PARTIES AND VOTERS IS FAST. PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS IN ILLINOIS EARLIER TODAY WARNING OLDER VOTERS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ENTITLEMENTS IF THE GOP REGAINS THE MAJORITY IN CONGRESS.  SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, ARE MORE THAN GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THEY ARE A PROMISE. THEY ARE A PROMISE. WE'RE COUNTING CONTRIBUTE, AND WHEN THE TIME COMES TO RETIRE THINGS WILL BE A LITTLE EASIER FOR YOU. YOU'VE BEEN PAYING FOR THIS YOUR WHOLE LIFE. NOW THESE GUYS WANT TO TAKE IT AWAY. WHO IN THE HOUSE THAT THEY THINK THEY'RE? I REALLY MEAN IT, THINK ABOUT IT. . NBC NEWS IS REPORTING THAT NEARLY 39 MILLION AMERICANS HAVE ALREADY VOTED EARLY AND DESPITE CONCERNS AND REPORTS OF VOTER INTIMIDATION AT POLLING SITES, EARLY VOTING IS OUT AT A PACE TO BREAK MIDTERM RECORDS IN SEVERAL STATES. BUT A BIGGER CONCERN FOR DEMOCRATS ON THE DEFENSIVE IS WHETHER IT INCLUDES IN THE TURNOUT, WHO WOULD INCLUDES, IF IT DOES NOT INCLUDE. ARE THEY SPECIFIC VOTERS THAT, THE PARTY NEEDS GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO PREVAIL. BECAUSE A FUTURE OF THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS HANGING IN THE BALANCE. ALONG OF COURSE WITH DEMOCRATS CONGRESSIONAL MAJORITIES. BUT IT IS IN THAT SENATE PARTICULARLY THAT DEMOCRATIC LEADERS ARE TRYING TO STAVE OFF LOSSES. PRESIDENT BIDEN IS BACK IN PHILADELPHIA TONIGHT ALONG WITH FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. BOTH SLATED TO TAKE THE RALLIES SIEGE SHORTLY IN SUPPORT OF DEMOCRATIC SENATE HOPEFUL JOHN FETTERMAN IN HIS TIGHT RACE AGAINST DOCTOR A MEHMET OZ. WHO WILL BE JOINED BY DONALD TRUMP FOR A CAMPAIGN RALLY IN A FEW HOURS. WE HAVE A BUSY FULL HOUR OF NEWS AND ANALYSIS AHEAD, AND WE START IN PENNSYLVANIA WHERE NBC NEWS REPORTER MIKE EMILY IS STANDING AHEAD OF THE BIDEN AND OBAMA PARTY TAKING THE STAGE TOGETHER. MIKE, SET THE SCENE FOR US PLEASE.  WELL,, REVIEW REALLY JUST NAILED IT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF UNDECIDED VOTERS. NOT JUST HERE IN THE CRITICAL BATTLEGROUND STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA, BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. BUT THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN THAT I AM HEARING AS I TALK TO WHITE HOUSE OFFICIALS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, IS WHETHER THAT MUCKRAKING THINGS YES AND LEVELS ARE MATCHING WHAT WE ARE SEEING ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, AND WHETHER THE DEMOCRATIC TURNOUT OPERATION WILL DELIVER WHAT IT NEEDS TO ON ELECTION DAY. AND THAT IS WHY WE ARE SEEING HERE IN ILLINOIS IF YOU TONIGHT SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T SEEN THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN. REALLY WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN TWO YEARS. IT IS THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, ROCK A, BOMBER JOINED BY HIS FORMER RUNNING MATE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, JOE BIDEN. AND THE TWO LEADING DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT HERE, JOHN FETTERMAN AND -- AND THEIR MESSAGE I'M TOLD IS GONNA BE TWOFOLD. ONE, ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH AN AWFUL LOT OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS. THAT THE DEMOCRATIC CONTROL OF CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE, THE BIDEN MINISTRATION IS TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING THAT THEY CAN TO DEAL WITH THOSE CHALLENGES FACING THE COUNTRY. BUT THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A LOT MORE TO DO. BUT THAT THEY KNOW DEMOCRATIC VOTERS CAN'T BE COMPLACENT. SO AS I LOOK AT THIS RALLY, RAF, I'M SEEING A LOT OF EXACTLY THE KIND OF VOTERS DEMOCRATS NEED TO TURN OUT ON ELECTION DAY. WE ARE HERE AT TEMPLE UNIVERSITY. A LOT OF YOUNG VOTERS. A LOT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN VOTERS, AS WELL IN THE CITY THAT ARE GONNA BE CRITICAL. THEIR TURNOUT COULD BE THE MARGIN OF VICTORY HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA. SO THIS IS THE SECOND TIME WE ARE GONNA SEE PRESIDENT BOMB ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL FOR DEMOCRATS. BIDEN HAS OBVIOUSLY HAD A BUSY SCHEDULE HIMSELF.  ALL, RIGHT WELL THANK YOU NBC'S MIKE MEMOLI AND WE WILL BE BACK TO YOU ONCE THE PRESIDENT IS TAKING THE STAGE. JOINING ME NOW, SENATOR GARY PETERS. DEMOCRAT OF MICHIGAN. HE IS THE CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE AND CHAIR OF THE SENATE HOMELAND SECURITY. SENATOR, THANK YOU FOR SOME OF REJOINING US TONIGHT. DEMOCRATS ARE DOING WHAT THEY CAN TO HOLD ON TO THE CONGRESSIONAL MAJORITIES, PARTICULARLY THE SENATE. WHERE THAT RAZOR-THIN MAJORITY IS THERE IN SEVERAL KEY SENATE RACES ARE NECK AND NECK RIGHT NOW. MAKING CONTROL APPEAR TOSS-UP. WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE COUNTRY IF THE DEMOCRATS WERE TO LOSE CONTROL OF THE SENATE, AND WHAT IS THE STRATEGY WITH THREE DAYS LEFT TO PREVENT THAT?  WELL, THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON THE PROGRAM. CERTAINLY THE CONSEQUENCES ARE SIGNIFICANT. WE HAVE HEARD THE PRESIDENT IN A SEGMENT EARLIER HERE ON THE PROGRAM TALKING ABOUT HOW SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE COULD BE REDUCED IF THE REPUBLICANS TAKE THE MAJORITY. THEY'RE ALREADY SAYING THAT. ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PASS IN CONGRESS WHICH WOULD REQUIRE MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE DRUG COMPANIES TO BRING DOWN THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WE HAVE GOT TO REPUBLICANS ALREADY SAYING THAT THEY ARE INTRODUCING LEGISLATION TO UNWIND THAT. BASICALLY THEY WANT TO STAND UP FOR THE BIG DRUG COMPANIES, WHEREAS DEMOCRATS WE PASSED COMPREHENSIVE LEGISLATION TO HELP EVERYDAY AMERICANS LOWER THE COST TO THEIR FAMILIES AND LOWER THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THAT JUDICIARY AS WELL AND HOW IMPORTANT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IN THE SENATE THAT WE ARE CONFIRMING JUDGES WHO BELIEVE IN THE RULE OF LAW, WHO BELIEVE IN UPHOLDING DEMOCRACY. IF WE LOSE CONTROL OF THE SENATE, THAT WILL BE DIFFICULT AND I WILL SAY OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONFIRM 85 HOSTAGES WHICH IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT.  NOW, SENATOR, LET'S THINK ABOUT OUTCOMES ON TUESDAY. A RECENT IPSOS POLL FOUND THAT NEARLY 40% OF REPUBLICAN VOTERS ARE LIKELY TO BLAME, TO PUT THE BLAME OF FRAUD ON THE GOP ELECTION LOSS OF. NEARLY 20% ARE HIGHLY LIKELY TO DO SO. I THINK ABOUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF ALLEGED VOTER INTIMIDATION AND HARASSMENT THAT WE HAVE SEEN FROM NORTH CAROLINA, ARIZONA, AND OTHER STATES. GIVEN YOUR WORK WITH THE DEMOCRATIC SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE ON AND AS CHAIR OF HOMELAND SECURITY, WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS?  WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE BIG, THE NUMBERS JUST PUT ON THE SCREEN ARE VERY DISTURBING. AND IT SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE ELECTED OFFICIAL START OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT LYING ABOUT THE PREVIOUS ELECTION AND TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE ELECTIONS. IT HAS SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FUTURE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL REPUBLIC OF OURS AND OUR DEMOCRACY. AND IT ALSO THREATENS. PEOPLE WE KNOW THAT THE RHETORIC THE HARMFUL RHETORIC THAT HAS INSPIRED VIOLENCE, UNFORTUNATELY, POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND DEATH THREATS AGAINST MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AT AN UNPRECEDENTED RATE IS ALL THE RESULT OF THIS BIG LIE. AND NOW WE ARE SEEING ELECTION DENIERS RUNNING. A LARGE NUMBER OF THE CANDIDATES RUNNING ON THE REPUBLICAN TO GET OUR ELECTIONS BUYERS. GOD HELP US IF THEY GET ELECTED. WHAT WILL THEY DO TO OUR ELECTION SYSTEM AND UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY IS A VERY FRIGHTENING PROSPECT. AT THE SEC, WE HAVE INVESTED UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNTS OF MONEY INTO ELECTION PROTECTION. WE STARTED THIS LAST YEAR. NOT JUST RECENTLY, WE UNDERSTOOD THAT REPUBLICANS WERE GOING TO TRY TO DISRUPT THIS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS IF THEY CAN. WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO THWART THAT. WE HAVE GOT FOLKS ON STAFF. WE HAVE GOT LAWYERS, TEAMS IN ALL OF OUR KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE ELECTION PROCESS GOES SMOOTHLY WITH COMPLETE INTEGRITY. AND THAT INCLUDES HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENTS, WHICH IS ALSO CERTAINLY PUTTING OUT WARNINGS NOW THAT THERE COULD BE VIOLENCE DURING THIS ELECTION SEASON. SO WE HAVE TO BE FOCUSED AND IT SHOULD, IF ANYTHING ELSE IT MEANS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ELECTING DEMOCRATS IN THESE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES. FOLKS I HAVE TO GET OUT TO VOTE. AND IF THEY CAN VOLUNTEER OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS, IT WILL MAKE YOU DIFFERENCE. GET OUT THE VOTE EFFORTS WILL MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN THESE KEY BATTLEGROUND STATES.  SENATOR, WE TALK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE NATION IF DEMOCRATS LOSE CONTROL OF THE SENATE. WHAT KIND OF PICTURE OUR SENATE DEMOCRATS LOOKING AT IF THEY LOSE AND BECOME THE MINORITY COME JANUARY. THE IMPACT OF THE PRIORITIES LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES, HOW DOES THAT LOOK AHEAD IF YOU WERE TO LEAD THE MINORITY PARTY IN THE SENATE?  WELL, THOSE PRIORITIES WOULD COME TO AN END. SO THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE TO PASS GUN SAFETY LEGISLATION, THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE TO INCREASE INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, TO BRING DOWN THE COST TO FAMILIES LIKE LOWERING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DIVERSIFY OUR ENERGY SECTOR, PUTTING IN RENEWABLE ENERGY TO BRING DOWN THE COST OF ENERGY, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON PEOPLE LIKE PUTIN AND OTHER AUTOCRATS AROUND THE WORLD THE DRIVE OF ENERGY PRICES, THE ABILITY FOR US TO FIGHT AGAINST OIL COMPANIES THAT ARE RACKING UP MASSIVE PROFITS AS A RESULT OF THE CATCHING THAT THEY ARE DOING AT THE GAS PUMPS. ALL OF THAT CHANGES. YOU HAVE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE OF ALREADY SAID THAT THEY ARE GOING TO ROLLBACK THE DRUG LAW THAT WE PASSED, BRING DOWN THE PRICE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THEY ARE CITING WITH BIG PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES. THEY'VE ALWAYS SIDED WITH BIG OIL COMPANIES. THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE STANDING WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER TO TRY TO STOP THE BIDEN AGENDA FOR MOVING FORWARD. THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER IN THIS ELECTION. WE KNOW ALL THESE RACES ARE RAZOR-THIN. I AM CONFIDENT WE CAN WIN BECAUSE WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER A GREAT GROUND OPERATIONS AND ALL OF OUR KEY STATES. BUT THAT ALSO MEANS THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING OUT TO VOTE. AND IF YOU'VE ALREADY VOTED, IF YOU PUT ADDITIONAL HELP, REACH OUT TO THE LOCAL CAMPAIGNS, WELL INTO THESE NEXT TWO DAYS. WHEN YOU ARE IN THESE RAZOR-THIN ELECTIONS THAT WE ARE IN, EVERY VOTE MATTERS. IT COULD COME DOWN TO A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF VOTES. WE NEED PEOPLE OUT. ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU SENATOR GARY PETERS. JOINING ME NOW, VAL\u00c9RIE JARRETT, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. MISS CHARIOT, WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE WHEN YOU JOIN US HERE ON POLITICSNATION. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THE VALUE OF YOUR BEING HERE. AND I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THE VALUE OF THE BLACK VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS, ESPECIALLY IN THIS MIDTERM CYCLE. THE HEADLINE FROM THE WASHINGTON POST THIS WEEKEND ASKING THE QUESTION. QUOTE, DEMOCRATS COUNT ON HUGE BLACK TURNOUT, THAT HAS THE PARTY DELIVERED IN RETURN? ADDING A QUOTE. GIVEN THAT THE POLITICAL FUNDAMENTALS OF THE MIDTERM ELECTION FAVOR PUBLICANS, BLACK VOTERS ARE MORE CRUCIAL THAN EVER FOR THE DEMOCRATS. ONE OVERRIDING QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY WILL TURN OUT IN NUMBERS BIG ENOUGH TO OFFSET THOSE GOP ADVANTAGES. THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY SPEAKS TO BLACK VOTERS AS EFFECTIVELY AS NEEDED. AND OF QUOTE. NOW, BLACK VOTERS ARE EXPECTED TO FIGURE SIGNIFICANTLY IN MICHIGAN, NORTH CAROLINA, PENNSYLVANIA, WISCONSIN, AND OF COURSE GEORGIA. ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT DELIVERED FOR BLACK VOTERS AND THAT IT WILL HAUNT HIM ON TUESDAY?  I THINK THE DEMOCRATS WERE IN POWER RIGHT NOW I HAVE MOST CERTAINLY DELIVERED FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND I THINK WE ARE SEEING RECORD TURNOUT AND THAT IS ENCOURAGING BUT WE CANNOT REST ON OUR LAURELS. I WAS HAPPY TO SEE SENATOR LEADERS EMPHASIZE HOW IMPORTANT THESE NEXT FEW DAYS ARE. EVERYTHING ABOUT MATTERS. SO YES, I THINK THAT DEMOCRATS HAVE DEFINITELY DELIVERED. . AND LOOK AT THE CONTRAST. REPUBLICANS ARE THREATENING TO TAKE AWAY OUR MEDICARE. AND MEDICAID, SOCIAL SECURITY. YOU'VE WORKED YOUR WHOLE LIFE, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO COUNTER THAT. A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. WE SEE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY, AND REVEREND AL, YOU AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS MANY TIMES. LAWS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED BY REPUBLICAN LEGISLATURES TO TRY TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE. AND WHO ARE THOSE LOST DIRECTED AT, THEY ARE DIRECTED A BLACK PEOPLE, YOUNG PEOPLE, MAKING IT MORE CHALLENGING. AND WHAT I AM ENCOURAGED BY, ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS RIGHT IS RIGHT THIS MINUTE KNOCKING ON DOORS IN ATLANTA. AND SHE SAID PEOPLE ARE STANDING IN LINES FOR HOURS, DETERMINED TO VOTE. SO THE EFFORTS THAT THEY WENT THROUGH TO TRY TO MAKE IT HARDER WILL BE PROVEN TO BE INEFFECTIVE. BUT WE CAN'T TAKE ANYTHING FOR GRANTED. WE HAVE TO TURN OUT AND WE HAVE TO VOTE. AND IT ISN'T JUST HEALTH CARE. THE ECONOMY. ALL OF THE DIFFERENT RIGHTS, VOTING, RIGHT CIVIL RIGHTS THAT ARE ALL AT STAKE. BUT REVEREND, THE UNDERLYING FOUNDATION OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS BEING CHALLENGED. AND SO, WE HAVE BEEN THAT WE GET UP TO THE WORLD. THE DEMOCRACY THAT BELIEVES IN THE RULE OF LAW, AND WHAT WE ARE SEEING AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE ATTEMPTS TO PULL, POOL THE FABRIC EVER MENINGES THAT FOUNDATION. THAT WOULD ALLOW TO TUMBLE. AND WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE IF IT DOES, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO SUFFER MOST ARE THAT PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE THE STRONG VOICES. AND SO WE HAVE TO BE THE STRONG VOICES. AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLES RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. AND THAT IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN IF THE REPUBLICANS WIN, WE KNOW THAT.  I NEED TO QUICKLY GET YOUR OPINION ON SOMETHING. SPEAKER NANCY PELOSI PUBLICLY ADDRESSED THE RECENT ASSAULT ON HER HUSBAND FOR THE FIRST TIME YESTERDAY. ONE OF OUR, CALL WITH DEMOCRATIC ACTIVE AFTER ONE DAY AFTER PABLO'S HE WAS RELEASED FROM THE HOSPITAL AFTER SUFFERING A FRACTURED SKULL IN THE ATTACK. MOST TOP REPUBLICANS HAVE CONDEMNED THE ATTACK, BUT WITHOUT CONNECTING IT TO A CLIMATE OF INCREASED POLITICAL VIOLENCE. AND THEN OF COURSE, YOU HAVE HAD SOME REPUBLICANS WEAK LIGHT OF THE INCIDENT. TURNING IT INTO A PUNCHLINE OR ECHOING TO BUNKS CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT IN THE PELOSI HOME. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THE GOP'S REACTION?  FIRST OF ALL, MY HIGH GOES OUT TO THE ENTIRE PELOSI FAMILY. SPEAKER PELOSI HAS SERVED OUR COUNTRY ADMIRABLY OVER HER TENURE. HER FAMILY SHOULD NOT COME UNDER ATTACK EVER. NOBODY'S FAMILY SHOULD COME UNDER ATTACK. AND I DO THINK THAT THERE IS A DIRECT LINE BETWEEN THIS DARK UNDERCURRENT THAT HAS BEEN BUBBLING UP IN OUR COUNTRY AND THE VIOLENCE THAT WE ARE SEEING SPREADING AROUND. AND ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE BEING TARGETED, AND WE SHOULDN'T STAND FOR THAT. THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. AND SO, REVEREND, I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT, NOT JUST SPEAKER PELOSI BUT THAT ANY MEMBER WHO WOULD BE ATTACKED OR WHOSE FAMILY WOULD BE ATTACKED, THAT AGAIN IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE PILLARS OF OUR DEMOCRACY. WE BELIEVE IN THE RULE OF LAW. AND WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO COME UNDER THREAT BECAUSE WE SIMPLY TRY TO SERVE OUR COUNTRY. AND THAT SHOULD APPLY TO MEMBERS OF BOTH PARTIES.  LET'S STAND BY A MINUTE. I WANT TO TAKE YOU LIVE TO THE PHILADELPHIA PENNSYLVANIA WHERE PRESIDENT BIDEN AND FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA ARE CAMPAIGNING FOR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR JOHN FETTERMAN. WHO IS RUNNING FOR THE U.S. SENATE. AND FOR JOSHUA PIRRO WHO IS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR OF THE STATE. THE EVENT IS AT TEMPLE UNIVERSITY. LET'S LISTEN IN FOR A MOMENT.  HELLO PHILADELPHIA. HELLO, HELLO, HELLO. DON'T JUMP. GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL. THIS CROWD IS ALLOWED, I THINK THEY CAN HEAR US IN THE TROVE. THEY ARE GOING TO HEAR US. THEY ARE GOING TO HEAR US ON TO SAY. FOLKS, I AM JILL BIDEN'S HUSBAND, A PHILLY GIRL. SHE IS READY FOR GAME SIX LIKE ALL OF YOU. IT IS GOOD TO BE HOME. IT IS GOOD TO BE A FAMILY. THAT INCLUDES SOMEONE WE ALL OF, BARACK OBAMA. A GREAT PRESIDENT. A HISTORIC PRESIDENT. AND I AM PROUD TO SAY, A DEAR FRIEND. WELL FOLKS, THREE DAYS. THREE DAYS. UNTIL ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTIONS AMONG ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTIONS IN OUR LIFETIME. IT IS GOING TO SHAPE. THE OUTCOME IS GONNA SHAPE OUR COUNTRY FOR DECADES TO COME. THE POWER TO SHAPE THAT OUTCOME IS IN YOUR HANDS. TWO YEARS AGO YOU USED THAT POWER TO MAKE DONALD TRUMP NOT ONLY A FORMER PRESIDENT, BUT YOU MADE HIM A DEFEATED PRESIDENT. AND THIS YEAR, YOU HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE JOHN FETTERMAN YOUR NEXT UNITED STATES SENATOR. AND JOSH SHAPIRO, YOU'RE NEXT GOVERNOR. BUT FOLKS, I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR, AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY. ABOUT WHAT IS ON THE BALLOT THIS YEAR. YOU ARE RIGHT TO CHOOSE IS ON THE BALLOT. YOU ARE RIGHT TO VOTE IS ON THE BALLOT. SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE IS ON THE BALLOT. THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE ON THE BALLOT. CHARACTER. CHARACTER IS ON THE BALLOT. WHEN I THINK OF CHARACTER I THINK OF JOHN FETTERMAN. IT'S AN ENDORSEMENT OF HIM IN THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER WHERE THEY SAID, JOHN KNOWS WHAT HIS VALUES ARE. WELL, I'VE BEEN SAYING IT FOR A LONG TIME. I'M A PENNSYLVANIA BOY BORN AND RAISED IN SCRANTON. BUT, FOR THE LONGEST TIME DELAWARE LIKE MANY OTHER SMALL PLACES DID NOT HAVE A TELEVISION STATION SO PHILADELPHIA TV HAD TO COVER ME THE SAME AS I COVERED ALL OF THE PENNSYLVANIA SENATORS. I WAS KNOWN AS PENNSYLVANIA'S THIRD SENATOR. MY POINT IS, I KNOW PENNSYLVANIA WELL. JOHN FETTERMAN IS PENNSYLVANIA. HE HAS PENNSYLVANIA. IN THE OURS AND PENNSYLVANIA? LOOK, I LIVED IN PENNSYLVANIA LONGER OF AN OFFICER TO PENNSYLVANIA. AND I MOVED AWAY WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS OLD. LIKE A LOT OF US, JOHN GOT KNOCKED DOWN, BUT HE GETS BACK UP. HE'S GONNA QUICKLY. JOHN'S CHARACTER, INTEGRITY, AND IS GOING TO BE HELD AGAINST SENATOR. FOR THE UNITED STATES AND EVERY PENNSYLVANIA. IN THE OTHER THING IS, DON'T WORRY. WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT IRAN. COURAGE. COURAGE IS ALSO ON THE BALLOT. WHEN I THINK OF COURAGE I THINK OF JOHN SHAPIRO. THIS GUY WILL TAKE ON ANYONE AND BACK DOWN TO NO ONE. AND WE SAW THAT IN 2020. HE STOOD UP FOR THE CONSTITUTION. HE STOOD UP FOR THE RULE OF LAW. HE STOOD UP FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. AND HE IS GOING TO BE ONE HELL OF A FANTASTIC GOVERNOR. HE REALLY IS. IT'S NOT JUST ON A JOSH, WE HAVE A GREAT DEMOCRATIC LINEUP ON THE BALLOT HERE IN THE STATE. YOU HEARD FROM A LOT OF THEM TODAY. YOU HEARD FROM A LOT OF THEM. WE HAVE ONE OF THE BEST ALLEGATIONS. I KEEP SAYING WE, I MAKE MYSELF PENNSYLVANIA AGAIN. BUT REALLY, DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT. WE NEED TO ELECT THEM ALL. WE NEED IT BADLY. PENNSYLVANIA, THIS ISN'T IN A REFERENDUM THIS YEAR. IT IS A CHOICE. A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO VASTLY DIFFERENT VISIONS OF AMERICA. VASTLY DIFFERENT. MAYBE IT'S IN OUR BLOOD, BUT JOHN AND I BELIEVE THAT ALL, IT IS ALL ABOUT FIGHTING FOR THE WORKING IN MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE. THE WAY I HAVE SAID IT, FROM THE BEGINNING OF MY CAMPAIGN, MY JACKET WHEN I RAN FOR PRESIDENT. WAS TO BUILD AN ECONOMY FROM THE BOTTOM UP IN THE MIDDLE OUT. IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT COMPARED TO THE OZ AND THE MEGA MAGA REPUBLICAN TRIPLE DOWN ECONOMICS. NO REALLY. THIS AIN'T YOUR FATHER'S REPUBLICAN PARTY. THIS IS A DIFFERENT BREED OF CAT. I REALLY MEAN IT. LOOK, THEY ARE ALL ABOUT THE WEALTHY ARE GETTING WEALTHY. AND THE WEALTHY ARE STAYING WEALTHY. THE MIDDLE CLASS GETS STAFFED, THE POOR GET POORER UNDER THEIR POLICY. YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME UNDER MY PREDECESSOR. THE ECONOMY WAS IN RUINS. HE WAS THE FIRST PRESIDENT SINCE HERBERT HOOVER TO LOSE JOBS IN THE COURSE OF HIS PRESIDENCY. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WAS 6.4%. HE LOST MANUFACTURING JOBS AND HUNDREDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE, AND 100,000 NATIONWIDE. LOOK, FOLKS, THE COUNTRY IS IN A PANDEMIC. WITH NO PLAN HOW TO GET OUT. THEY HAVE SWORN ONLY 2 MILLION PEOPLE VACCINATED. NOW MORE THAN 220 MILLION AMERICANS ARE FULLY VACCINATED. SO WE MOVE. AND OUR APPROACH IS WORKING. SINCE I CAME TO OFFICE, WE CREATED 10 MILLION NEW GOOD PAYING JOBS. 10 MILLION. BECAUSE OF YOU ALL. 10 MILLION. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 3.7%, NEAR RECORD 50 YEAR LOW. JOHN AND I UNDERSTAND. WE NEED TO MAKE THINGS IN AMERICA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME, AND WE ARE. THAT MEANS INSTEAD OF SHIPPING JOBS OVERSEAS, WE ARE SHIPPING PRODUCT OVERSEAS. I AM SERIOUS. WE HAVE CREATED SO FAR 700,000 MANUFACTURING JOBS JUST IN THE LAST 20 MONTHS. 700,000. BUT FOR ALL OF OUR PROGRESS, AND BY THE WAY WHERE THE HECK IS IT WRITTEN? THAT WE CAN'T BE THE MANUFACTURING CAPTURE OF THE WORLD AGAIN, BECAUSE WE WILL BE. WE WILL BE. AND FOLKS, LOOK, A LOT OF FAMILIES ARE STILL STRUGGLING. A LOT OF FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING. THAT IS WHY I SIGNED INTO LAW THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT THAT IS GONNA REDUCE THE COST OF EVERYDAY THINGS FOR FAMILIES IN PENNSYLVANIA. THINGS YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR EVERY MONTH AND YOU HAVE ENOUGH YOUR PAYCHECK TO DO IT. WE GAVE MEDICARE THE POWER TO NEGOTIATE LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS. THE SAME POWER THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS TO CUT DRUG PRICES HAVE. WE TRIED TO GET THAT DONE FOR YEARS, WHEN I WAS IN THE SENATE AS VICE PRESIDENT. THE BIG PHARMA SPENT A LOT OF MONEY AND SUPPORTED A LOT OF VOTES. WELL GUESS WHAT? NOT THIS YEAR. WE BEAT BIG PHARMA. AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ONE. WE PUT A CAP OF $2,000 FOR OUR SENIORS FIRST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ON MEDICARE, NO MATTER WHETHER DRUG COSTS WERE. AND SOME OF THEM PAID TEN, 12, $14,000 A YEAR FOR CANCER DRUGS. BUT NOW, BEGINNING JANUARY ONE, THEY WILL NOT HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN $2,000 A YEAR PERIOD. PERIOD. WE PUT A CAP ON INSULIN TO DEAL WITH THE DIABETES INSTEAD OF BEING PART OF THE MONTH LIKE THERE RIGHT NOW, IT WILL BE NO MORE THAN $35 A MONTH. AND WITH JOHN FETTERMAN IN THE SENATE WITH THAT ONE MORE VOTE THAT I NEED, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAP PRICES FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON, ALL OF THAT. BECAUSE THEY BLOCKED. WE HAD IT IN THE MEASURABLE BILL, BUT IT ONLY STAYED IN FOR MEDICARE RECIPIENTS. BUT EVERYONE, HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO HAS TO TAKE INSULIN FOR DIABETES? LOOK AROUND. AND IT IS INCREDIBLY COSTLY. NO MATTER WHAT YOUR AGE IT IS BADLY NEEDED. AND FOLKS, LOOK, WE MADE THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT TO DEAL WITH THE CLIMATE CRISIS EVER. WE ARE LOWERING ENERGY COSTS FOR FAMILIES. AND BY THE WAY, JOSH AND JOHN KNOW THAT WE CAN CAP OIL AND GAS PRICES WELL AND IN A BIND IN MINDS. WE DO THAT IT WAS WRESTLEMANIA. WE CAN CREATE THOUSANDS OF GOOD PAYING JOBS FOR THE SAME PEOPLE WHO ATTACKED THOSE MINES IN THE FIRST PLACE. THAT IS WHY WE ARE INVESTING 300 AND $50 MILLION HERE IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY TO DO JUST THAT. WE ARE NOT JUST TALKING IT, WE ARE DOING IT. WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS WELL REDUCING THE FEDERAL DEFICIT. YOU KNOW BECAUSE OF THE HELP THAT I HAVE FROM THE SENATORS ON THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS, WE LITERALLY CUT THE FEDERAL DEBT IN HALF BY 1.4 TRILLION DOLLARS. 1.4 TRILLION. JUST THIS WEEK YEAR, AND LAST YEAR, BY 350 BILLION. IN ANOTHER 250 BILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE. LOOK, I DON'T HEAR FROM THE MAGA REPUBLICANS WHO BLEW UP THE DEATH. WE ARE THE ONES BRINGING IT DOWN. THEY SHOT IT UP. AND BY SUCH A MASSIVE REDUCTION AND THAT WE ARE ABLE TO HELP WORK IN CLASS FAMILIES IN AMERICA. LOOK. WE ARE FINALLY MAKING SURE THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS BEGAN TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE FOR GOD SAKE. ONE OF THE REASONS THEY ARE SO UPSET WITH ME AS WE JUST PASSED A MINIMUM 15% TAX. LOOK, FOLKS, IF YOU ARE A SCHOOLTEACHER YOU PAY MORE THAN THAT. IF YOUR COPY MORE THAN 50%. BUT THE DAYS ARE OVER FOR CORPORATIONS PAYING ZERO FEDERAL TAX. BY THE WAY, IN 20 2055 OF THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS IN AMERICA PAY 40 BILLION DOLLARS, AND THEY PAID NOT ONE SINGLE PENNY IN FEDERAL TAX, NOT ONE. BECAUSE WE REDUCE THE DEFICIT SO MUCH, WE ARE IN A POSITION TO HELP MILLIONS OF WORKERS AND MIDDLE CLASS VOTERS CALLING THE CROSS FOR THE PANDEMIC. AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE. BECAUSE I ACTED, WE PROVIDED $10,000 IN STUDENT DEBT RELIEF. AND ANOTHER 10,000 IF YOU GOT UPHELD GRAHAM. NO ONE UNDER 20 WOULD HAVE TO BE MAKING LESS THAN 20% A YEAR. AND 90% OF THAT MONEY GOES TO PEOPLE EARNING LESS THAN $75,000 A YEAR. AND, LOOK, IT IS AN INCREDIBLE BURDEN TO CARRY. SO NOW THEY'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO BUY HOMES, START A BUSINESS, JUST GET A LITTLE BIT OF BREATHING ROOM. AND WHATEVER MY REPUBLICANS LIKE OZ AND MASTRIANO ARE TALKING ABOUT, THEY'RE TRYING TO STOP ME. THEY THEIR HYPOCRISY IS UNBELIEVABLE. THE SAME AGGRAVATIONS WHO TOOK HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS, EVEN MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE PANDEMIC RELIEF LOANS, HAD THEIR LOANS FORGIVEN, ARE TRYING NOW TO BLOCK STUDENT LOANS. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. GOD BLESS HER SOUL, SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD $183,000 IN PPP LOANS FORGIVEN. CONGRESSMAN VERNON CANNON A FLORIDA, HE GOT OVER 2 MILLION FORGIVEN. WHO THE HELL THAT THEY THINK THEY ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT HELPING OUT STUDENTS? WHO DO THEY THINK? I REALLY MEAN IT. AND THE STUDENTS ARE THE PEOPLE GETTING DEBT RELIEF ARE GONNA BE SPENDING THE MONEY ON GROWING THE ECONOMY, FOR GOD SAKE. OF THE MAGRA POLICE DON'T THINK WE SHOULD GIVE WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS BREAK. BUT HERE'S WHAT THEY DO YOU THINK INSTEAD. THEY WANT TO MAKE PERMANENT THE TWO TRILLION DOLLAR TAX CUT THAT THEY PASSED WHEN TRUMP WAS PRESIDENT. THAT TAX CUT IS NOW A PENNY PAID FOR, AND IT GOES TO THE BIGGEST CORPORATIONS. AND IT WILL EXPLODE THE DEFICIT BY TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THEY THINK THE BIGGEST OIL COMPANIES, THE SIXTH LARGEST OIL COMPANIES IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CRISIS WE ARE IN. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY THEY MADE IN THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTER, I MEAN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER? 100 BILLION DOLLARS. 100 BILLION. IT IS OUTRAGEOUS. THEY SHOULD HAVE USE THAT MONEY FOR WHAT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DO. TO LOWER GAS PRICES AT THE PUMP FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IF THEY DID, THE PRICE AT THE PUMP WOULD BE 50 CENTS LOWER THAN IT IS TODAY PER GALLON. IT GETS WORSE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY AS IF THEY WIN? THEY ARE SAYING IT OUT LOUD. THEY WANT TO GET RID OF EVERYTHING WE JUST SAID. THE POWER WE JUST GAVE MEDICARE TO NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES, GONE. THE 2000 DOLLAR KAPAN PRESCRIPTION PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, GOD. THE 35-DOLLAR CAP ON INSULIN, GONE. THE TAX CUT FOR LOWER ENERGY COSTS, GOD. 50% CURVATURE, GONE. 800 DOLLAR SAVINGS IN HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS WE DISCOVER FAMILIES NEED PORTABLE CARE ACT, GONE. IN FACT, THEY WANT TO DO AWAY WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND THAT MEANS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS WOULD LOSE THEIR INSURANCE COMPLETELY. NO MATTER HOW HARD THEY TRY TO GET RID OF OBAMACARE, I'M NEVER GONNA LET IT HAPPEN. IN JOHN FETTERMAN WILL NOT LET IT HAPPEN EITHER. BUT FOLKS, THESE GUYS NEVER 60S TO AMAZE ME. THEY NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME. NOW IT GETS WORSE. THEY ARE LITERALLY COMING AFTER SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE. LOOK, I KNOW THE ONLY THING YOU YOUNGER PEOPLE IN HERE, THANK GOD THERE'S SO MANY OF YOU. I KNOW THE THING YOU KNOW IS FROM THE TIME YOU'RE 16 YOU HAD MONEY TAKEN OUT TO PAPER SO SECURITY. BUT GUESS WHAT? THERE IS SOMEBODY OUT THERE BUSTING THEIR NECK WHO JUST LOST THEIR HUSBAND OR THE WIFE, YOU'RE 66, 68 YEARS OLD, AND THEY WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR MEDICARE AND YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY. NOW YOU THINK I'M EXAGGERATING, FRONT PAGE OF THE NEW YORK TIMES TALKED ABOUT, ONLY SHOW YOU. THERE IS A GUY OUT THERE THEY TELL ME WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO. THEY ARE SAYING IT STRAIGHT OUT LOUD. AT LEAST THEY ARE WE CAN GIVE THEM CREDIT FOR THAT. LOOK, HERE'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO. THEY THERE IS A GUY NAMED SENATOR RICK SCOTT OF FLORIDA. WHO IS IN CHARGE OF ELECTING THE REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE. HE IS THAT GUY PUSHING OZ. OKAY. WELL, LET ME SHOW YOU. A READ FROM, THEY LISTED IN A PROGRAM ALL OF THEIR PROPOSALS. IT'S TOO SMALL TO BE A LITTLE READ. I JUST CIRCLED THE ONE THAT BROUGHT IT OUT HERE, AND I'M GONNA QUIT WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY. IT SAYS, ALL FEDERAL LEGISLATION, SUNSETS IN FIVE YEARS. IF THE LAW IS WORTH KEEPING, CONGRESS CAN PASS IT AGAIN. THE LAW LITERALLY GOES OUT OF EXISTENCE. SO IT IS AFFIRMATIVELY VOTED BACK INTO EXISTENCE. THEN ALONG CAME RON JOHNSON OF WISCONSIN, SENATOR. BY THE WAY, HE THINKS FIVE YEARS IS TOO LONG. NOT A JOKE. IT'S ALMOST RESPONDING. HE THINKS SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE SHOULD BE ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK EVERY SINGLE YEAR. IF CONGRESS DOESN'T VOTE TO KEEP IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT GOES AWAY. NOT A, JOKE IT GOES AWAY. IT IS NOT JUST SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE, HE ALSO WANTS TO PUT VETERANS BENEFITS ON THE LINE. LOOK, I PUT EVERYTHING. RISK ELECT JOHN FETTERMAN TO THE SENATE, PLEASE. HE WILL PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY IN MEDICARE AND WILL GUARANTEE THAT VETERANS ARE ALWAYS CARED FOR. ALWAYS ALWAYS. I WAS CRITICIZED WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED YEARS AGO WHEN I SAY, WE'VE A LOT OF OBLIGATIONS AND ONLY ONE TRULY SACRED OBLIGATION. TO PREPARE THOSE WE SENT TO OUR, AND TO CARE FOR THEM IN THEIR FAMILIES WHEN THEY COME HOME. THAT IS A SACRED OBLIGATION. SACRED OBLIGATION. WELL, FOLKS, THAT IS WHY I PUSHED INSIDE THAT THING CALLED THE PACT ACT. THE PACT ACT GUARANTEES HEALTH CARE FOR SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS EXPOSED TO TOXIC BURN PITS. THESE BENEFITS ARE THE SIZE OF FOOTBALL FIELDS AND RANGE IN-DEPTH FROM 8 TO 10 FEET. THERE IS EVERYTHING IN THEM FROM JET FUEL, AND JUST EVERYTHING IS BURNED THERE. YOU KNOW, REMEMBER ALL THE FIGHT ABOUT CANCER IN THE BRAIN CANCER STUFF, SO MANY FIREFIGHTERS WERE GETTING FROM THE 9/11 TOXIC EXPOSURE? WELL, IS THE SAME THING. I'VE BEEN IN AND OUT OF IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN OVER 30 TIMES. I HAD A SON WHO SPENT A YEAR IN IRAQ. HIS HOOCH WAS LITERALLY LESS THAN TWO YARDS FROM ONE OF THESE BURN PITS. WHAT WILL THIS NEW PROPOSAL GUARANTEES HEALTH CARE FOR THE SERVICE MEMBERS, AND VETERANS EXPOSED TO TOXIC BURN PITS. BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT IT DOES. LIKE MY SON, SO MANY WENT INCREDIBLY FED AND CAME HOME DIZZY AND HAVING TROUBLE, AND SO MANY OF BRAIN CANCER. MY SON CAME HOME WITH STAGE FOUR GLIOBLASTOMA AND HE PASSED AWAY. BUT HERE'S WHAT WE DID, UP TO NOW WE DON'T BAN ATTENTION TO THIS. WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING FOR IT. AND WE HAD TO FIGHT TO GET IT DONE. AND NOW FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE COMING HOME, MORE PEOPLE COMING HOME FROM THESE WARS WITH BRAIN CANCER THAN ANY OTHER WORN AMERICAN HISTORY. AND OTHER CANCERS. BUT GUESS WHAT? NOW IF THEY COME HOME AND YOU ARE STILL ALIVE, YOU GET FULL BENEFITS FOR HEALTH CARE TO TRY TO FIGHT A. AND THE FAMILIES GET MONTHLY STIPENDS. AND TUITION HELP FOR THE CHILDREN. LOOK, FOLKS, IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE ECONOMY. LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CRIME IN KEEPING COMMUNITIES SAFE. I SIGNED A MOTION TO BEGIN GUN SAFETY LAW NEARLY 30 YEARS. I PROPOSED OVER 100,000 NEW POLICE OFFICERS. HERE'S THE DEAL. PUBLIC SAFETY IS WHY JOHN GOT INTO PUBLIC SERVICE IN THE FIRST PLACE. OZ WON'T DO A THING ABOUT GUNS. BUT JOHN FETTERMAN, WITH YOUR VOTES, JOHN FETTERMAN WILL BE IN THE SENATE AND HELP ME ADD ONE MORE.  YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING PRESIDENT BIDEN CAMPAIGNING IN PENNSYLVANIA TOGETHER WITH FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA, LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GENERAL JOHN FETTERMAN WHO IS RUNNING FOR THE U.S. SENATE AND FOR JOSH SUPERHERO WHO IS RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR. WE WILL GO BACK THERE IN A MOMENT ONCE FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA TAKES THE STAGE. MEANWHILE, EARLY VOTING IS WRAPPING UP TOMORROW IN MANY COUNTIES OF FLORIDA. THERE IS STILL TIME TO GO ONLINE AND PLAN YOUR VOTE. ON TUESDAY, PRESIDENT BIDEN HELD A RALLY IN MIAMI AND SUPPORTED DEMOCRATIC HOPEFULS INCLUDING SENATE CANDIDATE VAL DEMI'S, REPRESENTATIVE DEMINGS JOINS ME NOW. CONGRESSWOMAN, YOU'VE BEEN LISTENING TO PRESIDENT BIDEN'S SPEECH, JUST NOW. WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT HE HAD TO SAY?  WELL, REVEREND, SHARPTON IS GREAT TO BE WITH YOU. LOOK, WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE GROUND HERE IN FLORIDA. AS YOU HAVE INDICATED, THE PRESIDENT WAS WITH US ON TUESDAY NIGHT WE HAD A GREAT GET OUT TO VOTE RALLY. BUT I THINK THE PRESIDENT HAS LAID OUT VERY CLEARLY THAT THERE IS REALLY ONLY ONE PARTY AND THAT IS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THAT IS WORKING TO LOWER COSTS, ADDRESSING EVERYTHING FROM THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS TO THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE COST OF COLLEGE DEBT, HOLDING THE LARGEST AND RICHEST OF CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTABLE. AND I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT SENDING OUR MESSAGE TO THE VOTERS SO THEY CAN CLEARLY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A CLEAR CHOICE IN MY RACE FOR THE SENATE, THERE IS A CLEAR CHOICE THAT U.S. SENATE RACES ALL OVER THE  THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE PARTY  WORKING FOR THE EVERY DAY WORKING CLASS. INCLUDING OUR SENIORS.  NOW CONGRESSWOMAN, REPUBLICANS HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME PAINTING THEIR DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS AS SOFT ON CRIME. BUT AS THE PRESIDENT SAID THIS WEEK, THAT WON'T WORK WITH YOU. YOU SERVED 20 YEARS IN THE ORLANDO POLICE DEPARTMENT INCLUDING FOUR YEARS AS THE FIRST FEMALE CHIEF. TALK TO ME ABOUT HOW THAT EXPERIENCE HAS SHAPED YOUR POLITICS.  YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW HOW GULLIBLE MARCO RUBIO RELIEVING'S FLORIDA VOTERS ARE. YOU'RE, RIGHT I SPENT 27 YEARS HAVING THE HONOR TO SERVE AS CHIEF OF POLICE BUT BRINGING THE COMMUNITY IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TOGETHER WE WERE ABLE TO REDUCE VIOLENT CRIME BY OVER 40%. WHICH IS STILL THE MOST DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN THE HISTORY OF OUR CITY. YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE ON THE GROUND EXPERIENCE, I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE AT THEIR BEST AND SEEING PEOPLE AT THEIR WORST. I HAVE HEARD THEIR STORIES. AND WE HAVE TO HIRE THE BRIGHTEST AND THE BEST TO DO THE JOB OF POLICING. WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM THE BEST TRAINING INVESTED WHEN IT. BUT WHAT I ALSO KNOW IS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE SOCIAL ILLS THAT CAUSED DECAY IN COMMUNITIES IN THE FIRST PLACE. LIKE POVERTY, LOWER WAGES, UNEMPLOYMENT, SUBSTANDARD EDUCATION, SUBSTANDARD HOUSING, BY ADDRESSING TO YOU, WE CAN HAVE SOME OF THE SAFEST COMMUNITIES NOT JUST IN ORLANDO BUT ACROSS THE NATION. THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR REAL LIFE EXPERIENCE AND BELIEVE ME, MARCO RUBIO DOESN'T HAVE THAT.  CONGRESSWOMAN, THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO BLACK WOMEN SERVING ON THE U.S. SENATE AND ONLY TWO BLACK WOMEN HAVE SERVED IN THE NATION'S HISTORY. IF ELECTED, YOU WOULD BECOME FLORIDA'S FIRST BLACK SENATOR, AND THERE IS A CHANCE THAT YOU MAY BE THE ONLY BLACK WOMEN REPRESENTING IN THE U.S. SENATE IN TOTAL. TALK TO ME ABOUT WHY THESE REPRESENTATIONS ARE SO IMPORTANT.  REVEREND, I AM CERTAINLY CHEERING MY COLLEAGUE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, CHERI BEASLEY FROM NORTH CAROLINA ON AS WELL. BUT LET ME SAY THIS, THE SENATE NEEDS TO NOT ONLY REFLECT THE DIVERSITY THAT WE SEE ACROSS OUR NATION BUT A DIVERSITY OF PERSPECTIVES OUT THAT PEOPLE. YOU BETTER BELIEVE GROWING UP POOR, BLACK, AND FEMALE IN THE SOUTH, I NOT ONLY BRING A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE BUT THE DIVERSITY THAT WE SHOULD SEE WITHIN THE SENATE. JUST AS WE ALL CELEBRATED JUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, NOT ONLY WAS SHE. COULD BE, I'M GONNA SAY, IT PROBABLY THE MOST EXPERIENCED JUSTICE ON THE BENCH, BUT SHE ALSO BRINGS A DIVERSITY OF PERSPECTIVE WITH HER PUBLIC DEFENDED EXPERIENCE. AND SO, BELIEVE ME, WHEN THE SENATE REFLECTS AMERICA, AND LOOKS LIKE AMERICA. EVERYTHING GETS BETTER.  NOW AS DEMOCRATS FIGHT TO KEEP CONTROL OF THE SENATE, ABORTION RIGHTS HAVE BECOME THE BETTING ISSUE OF THIS WINTER SEASON. YOU ARE OPPONENT, REPUBLICAN SENATE MARQUEE RUBIO'S COSPONSORING A BILL THAT WOULD BAN ABORTIONS AT AFTER 15 WEEKS OF PREGNANCY NATIONWIDE. EMBRACING SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM'S FEDERAL ABORTION BAN. YOU HAVE BEEN CRITICAL OF HIS STANCE ON ABORTION RIGHTS ALL THROUGHOUT YOUR CAMPAIGN. AND PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN VOWED TO BACK IN OCTOBER THAT IF VOTERS ELECT MORE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS AND KEEP THE HOUSE, HE WILL SEND THE BILL TO CONGRESS TO CODIFY ABORTION PROTECTIONS INTO LAW. IF ELECTED TO THE SENATE, WHAT WOULD YOU DO TO PROTECT THE ABORTION RIGHTS ON A FEDERAL LEVEL IN CONTRAST TO YOUR OPPONENT?  REVEREND SHARPTON, MARCO RUBIO HAS MADE CLEAR FOUR YEARS THAT HE WANTS A TOTAL NATIONAL BAN ON ABORTION, WITH ZERO EXCEPTIONS INCLUDING RAPE AND INCEST. SITTING IN THE SENATE RIGHT NOW IS THE WOMEN'S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT THAT WOULD CODIFY ROE VERSUS WADE. NOW, SHAME ON US THAT WE DID NOT CODIFY THIS LAW BEFORE NOW. BUT WE CAN GET TWO MORE SEATS IN THE SENATE, WE WILL HAVE THE NUMBERS THAT WE NEED TO BREAK THE FILIBUSTER AND MOVE THIS MUCH-NEEDED LEGISLATION FORWARD. PEOPLE MAY SAY, LOOK, ABORTION IS NOT MY ISSUE. ANYTIME WE SEND THE MESSAGE THAT IT IS OKAY TO TAKE AWAY A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OVER HERE, WE ARE SENDING A MESSAGE THAT IT IS OKAY TO TAKE AWAY A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT, EVERYWHERE. WE CANNOT ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. AND AS YOU KNOW, JUSTICE THOMAS CLEARLY COMMUNICATED THAT, OKAY, WE'VE GOT ROE V. WADE. LET'S LOOK AT SOME OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS. SO, THE WOMEN'S HEALTH PROTECTION ACT IS THERE. WE WILL VOTE FOR IT.  NOW DEMOCRATS ARE INCREASINGLY WORRIED THAT FLORIDA, ONCE CONSIDERED LACE NATIONS LARGEST SWING STATE, MAY SLIP AWAY TO REPUBLICANS AFTER THIS YEAR'S MIDTERMS. IN THE MOST RECENT PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS, FLORIDA WENT TWICE FOR FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA AND THEN TWICE FOR TRUMP. AND FLORIDA HASN'T HAD A DEMOCRATIC U.S. SENATOR SINCE 2018. WHEN BILL NELSON WAS IN OFFICE. NOW THIS WEEK IN FLORIDA, REPUBLICANS REPORTED THE OUTRAGEOUS ARE DEMOCRATS BY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WITH THREE DAYS TO GO, WHAT DO YOU WANT FLORIDIANS TO KNOW AS YOU MAKE YOUR FINAL PITCH AHEAD OF THE ELECTION DAY? WHAT IS AT STAKE IN YOUR RACE?  YOU KNOW WHAT REVEREND, OUR DEMOCRACY IS AT STAKE. AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS, AND DEMOCRATS WHO CARE ABOUT PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRACY. IT IS THE FOUNDATION ON WHICH WE BUILT A GREAT NATION. IF YOU WANT TO LOWER THE COST FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO GO TO WORK EVERY DAY, PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE, MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SAFE COMMUNITIES, MAKE SURE OUR CHILDREN ARE NOT SADDLED WITH COLLEGE DEBT, MAKE SURE WE REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE AND KEEP DANGEROUS WEAPONS OUT OF THE HANDS OF DANGEROUS PEOPLE, AND PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS SO THAT ALL PEOPLE CAN EXERCISE THE RIGHT TO VOTE, THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON IN FLORIDA THAT IS PREPARED AND HAS THAT COURAGE TO DO THAT AND THAT IS VAL DEMINGS. IF YOU WANT TO LEARN MORE, GOOD ABOUT THAT MIXED OUTCOME.  IN THE WAKE OF HURRICANE IAN THAT LEFT OUR SEEDING DAMAGE THROUGHOUT FLORIDA'S SOUTHWEST COAST, YOU HAVE EXTENSIVELY CRITICIZED REPUBLICAN FLORIDA SENATOR MARCO RUBIO FOR MISSING THE SENATE VOTE ON LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW FEMA TO ACCESS FUNDING FOR DISASTER RELIEF. MEANWHILE, RUBIO'S SPOKESPEOPLE DEFENDED THAT MOVE BY CLAIMING THE SENATOR MISSED THE VOTE BECAUSE HE WAS TOURING HURRICANE DAMAGE. HAS SENATOR RUBIO DONE ENOUGH FOR FLORIDIANS FOLLOWING THE DISASTER THAT THE HURRICANE IAN LEFT BEHIND?  REVEREND SHARPTON, DOING ENOUGH STARTS WITH BEING THERE TO VOTE. AND, LOOK, SENATOR RUBIO HAS TO BE ON THE SENATE FLOOR TO CAST HIS VOTE. BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT HE HAS A RECORD THAT HE DOESN'T SHOW OUT FOR WORK. AND WHEN HE SHOWS UP, HE VOTES USUALLY TO HURT FLORIDA. I SHARE THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON EMERGENCY REPAIRS-NESS AND RESPONSE RECOVERY. I CHOOSE TO TOUR THAT DAMAGED A FLOODED AREAS, IN CENTRAL FLORIDA AND TOUR THE UNBELIEVABLE DEVASTATED AREAS IN SOUTHWEST FLORIDA. SENATOR RUBIO SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE HOUSE FLOOR TO VOTE. SENATOR SCOTT GOT THERE AND VOTED. SENATOR RUBIO, ONCE AGAIN NEGLECTED HIS DUTIES AND I AM SURE HOPING THAT FLORIDA IS PAYING ATTENTION. ULTIMATELY, WE NEED TO DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL. IT IS SOMETHING ELSE FLORIDA'S SENIOR SENATOR HAS PLAYED AROUND WITH. IF WE WANT REAL REPRESENTATION, WE HAVE AN ELECTION IN THREE DAYS. VOTE FOR ABOUT DEMINGS.  CONGRESSWOMAN VAL DEMINGS, CANDIDATE FOR U.S. SENATE, IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. LET'S GO TO MY POLITICAL PANEL, NOW. JOINING ME NOW IS SUSAN DEL PERCIO. POLITICAL ANALYST AND REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST AND WE NEED A TOLLIVER, POLITICAL ANALYST AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST. BOTH ARE MSNBC CONTRIBUTORS. WHEN ETA, YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING ALONG WITH THE RALLY IN PHILADELPHIA RIGHT NOW. DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN GOING ALL OUT TO WIN THESE VERY CLOSE RACES, IN AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SWING STATE. DO YOU THINK OBAMA AND BIDEN CAN SEAL THE DEAL WITH PENNSYLVANIA VOTERS?  LOOK HAVE, I SURE HOPE. SO THEY ARE BRINGING A LOT OF ENERGY HERE AND LET'S KEEP IT REAL. FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA IS STILL ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR DEMOCRATIC FIGURES IN THE NATION. AND HE IS DRIVING ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM AND ULTIMATELY GETTING OUT THE VOTE FOR DEMOCRATS IN PENNSYLVANIA. AND WE KNOW THIS RACE IS GOING TO BE TIGHT, RAF. REMEMBER IN 2020, BIDEN ONLY WON PENNSYLVANIA BY 1.2 POINTS. SO IT IS GOING TO BE A TIGHT RACE, AND THIS TYPE OF RALLY, THIS TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT WHERE THE FORM PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS BEEN NOT ONLY IN PHILADELPHIA, BUT EARLIER TODAY IN PITTSBURGH, IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON HOW VOTERS SHOW UP, HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE PICK UP VOLUNTEER SHIFTS AND HELP GET OUT THE VOTE. BECAUSE IT ALL COMES DOWN TO WHO SHOWS UP IN VOTES.  NOW SEASON, DONALD TRUMP IS ALSO IN PENNSYLVANIA TONIGHT. HE WILL BE HOLDING A RALLY IN THAT LEAGUE THROW OUTSIDE OF PITTSBURGH ALONG SIDE REPUBLICAN SENATE CANDIDATE DR. OZ. AND GIVEN RHETORICAL CANDIDATE DOUG MASTRIANO. BUT THE BIG QUESTION WILL BE WHAT IF ANYTHING TRUMP WILL SAY ABOUT HIS OWN POTENTIAL RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE. TWO SOURCES FAMILIAR WITH HIS THINKING TELL NBC NEWS HE WILL LIKELY OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCE A THIRD PRESIDENTIAL RUN JUST WEEKS FROM NOW. BUT THE CAUTION, BUT CAUTION THAT THEY COULD SLIDE. TRUMP HAS BEEN TEASING ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL RUN FOR A WHILE NOW. BUT DO YOU THINK THIS CURRENT SPECULATION IS HELPING OR HURTING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES IN THE MIDTERMS?  I THINK IT IS ACTUALLY HURTING TRUMP BACKS REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES. IF YOU ARE DR. OZ, THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS TO HAVE DONALD TRUMP IN THE STATE THE WEEKEND BEFORE ELECTION DAY. DOCTOR OZ HAS BEEN TRYING, NOT SUCCESSFULLY IN MY OPINION, TO BE A BIT MORE MODERN. HAVING DONALD TRUMP COME, AND LET'S BE CLEAR ABOUT, IT FOR A RALLY FOR HIMSELF. I DON'T THINK YOU WILL HEAR THE CANDIDATES NAMES MORE THAN TWO OR THREE TIMES. MAYBE. BUT YOU WILL CERTAINLY HEAR A LOT OF, EYE EYE, EYE. AND WHETHER OR NOT HE DECIDES TO ANNOUNCE THAT HE IS RUNNING, I STILL THINK IT WILL NOT BE THE KIND OF RUN WHERE HE PUTS, ANNOUNCEMENT WHERE HE PUT SOME PAPERWORK IN. SO HE CAN TALK. HE WANTS THIS ALL RAISE MONEY. HE CAN SAY I AM DEFINITELY DEFINITELY REALLY THINKING ABOUT IT AND IT'S LOOKING GOOD, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BUT I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO SEE HIS NAME ON A BALLOT. BUT YOU WILL HURT A LOT OF PEOPLE ALONG THE WAY.  NOW, SUSAN, LET ME SAY WITH YOU A MINUTE. LET'S TURN TO NEW YORK THE NEW YORK GOVERNOR TERRELL ELECTION. THE RACE BETWEEN DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR KEPT THE HOPEFUL AND REPUBLICAN REPRESENTATIVE ZELDIN HAS TITANS IN THE FINAL WEEKS OF THE CAMPAIGN. WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS RACE HAS BECOME, WHY DO YOU THINK I SHOULD ASK, WHY DO YOU THINK THIS RACE HAS BECOME SO CLOSE IN A RELIABLY DEMOCRATIC STATE? IS THIS SIMILAR TO THE SCARE GOVERNOR PHIL MURPHY GOT LAST YEAR NEW JERSEY?  IT IS A COMBINATION OF THE SCARE PHIL MURPHY GOT A NEW JERSEY IN THE SENSE OF THE ECONOMICS GEAR WHICH IS WHAT WE SAW, NOT JUST NEW JERSEY, BUT IN NEW YORK ON LONG ISLAND LAST YEAR. BUT NOW YOU ADD THE ISSUE OF CRIME. AND WE SAW OUR ADAMS RUN A VERY SUCCESSFUL MAYORAL CAMPAIGN ON BEING A CRIME FIGHTER. A FORMER COP, UNDERSTANDING THE ISSUES. BUT THE PROBLEM IS, RIGHT NOW FOR KATHY HOCHUL, THOSE HEADLINES ARE STILL THERE. WE STILL ARE SEEING PEOPLE ON, YOU KNOW PAT FORMS IN OTHER PLACES FEELING AN INTENSE FEAR. AND YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS REV, IF YOU ARE AFRAID TO GO TO WORK, THAT IS NOT A PLACE FOR THE CITY OR STATE TO COME BACK. IT IS DEFINITELY IN THE WRONG DIRECTION, IF YOU WILL. AND THEN THERE IS JUST ONE KIND OF CAMPAIGN FACTOR WHICH IS THAT KATHY HOCHUL IS RUNNING FOR ELECTION, NOT REELECTION. SHE HAS RUN STATEWIDE AS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR BUT NEVER GOT MUCH ATTENTION. SHE DOESN'T HAVE AN OPERATION, AND LEANS ENDED IN HAS NOT LET GO OF CAMPAIGNING IN NEW YORK CITY WHICH IS SHOCKING. AND THAT IS WHERE THIS RACE IS CLOSE. IN NEW YORK CITY. HE HAD 35, 36% IN NEW YORK CITY. WE ARE TALKING THAT IT COULD BE A LETHAL DONE. I DON'T THINK WE WILL SEE IT HAPPEN, BUT BOY, THIS SHOWS JUST HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO KEEP UP YOUR CAMPAIGN NETWORK.  JUANITA, SWITCHING GEARS OUT TO A NEW REPORT BY THE NEW YORK TIMES WHICH EXPLORES RHONDA SANTA'S IS ONE YEAR OF TEACHING EXPERIENCE AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL IN GEORGIA AFTER HE GRADUATED YALE UNIVERSITY. THE PIECE EXPLAINS HOW A FORMER BLACK STUDENT RECALLS DESANTIS TEACHING THE CIVIL WAR IN A WAY THAT SOUNDED TO HER LIKE AN ATTEMPT TO JUSTIFY SLAVERY. 20 YEARS LATER, HE IS THE GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA WHICH IS THE STATE THAT HAS THE SECOND LARGEST AMOUNT OF BANNED BOOKS, INCLUDING THE HALF BOOKS. HE SAID CONTAINS CRITICAL RACE THEORY. WHAT MAKES THIS REPORT SO SIGNIFICANT? WHAT CAN PEOPLE GLEAN FROM HIS TEACHING PABST AND HOW THAT TRANSLATES INTO HIS POLICIES?  WELL FIRST, REV, I CANNOT PRETEND TO BE SHOCKED THAT SOMEONE WHO WAS TRYING TO BAN BASIC TEACHING A BASIC HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY TRIED TO TEACH THE CIVIL WAR AS THOUGH HE WAS JUSTIFYING SLAVERY. THAT SHOULD NOT COME AS A SURPRISE TO ANYONE. AND HONESTLY, IT SHOULD PRESENT A ROADMAP FOR HOW FAR HE IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GO TO KEEP THE TRUTH AWAY FROM YOUNG PEOPLE AND STUDENTS AND OUT OF SCHOOLS AND BASIC EDUCATION, SO ALL OF THE LAWS, EVERYTHING THAT HE HAS DONE TODAY TO TRY TO CREATE BARRIERS FOR BASIC EDUCATIONAL ELEMENTS OF HISTORY IS ONLY GETTING CONTINUE AND IT'S ONLY GONNA GET WORSE. AND HE IS GONNA CONTINUE TO RUN ON IT BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE HAS AN AUDIENCE WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WHO BELIEVES WHAT HE BELIEVES.  ALL RIGHT, SUSAN EL PRESIDIO, AND WE NEED A TOLERANT. THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING WITH US. MORE POLITICS NATION, AFTER THE BREAK. , AFTER TH BREAK. 20221105215541.170|20221105215904.273",

        "trs": " JUST THREE DAYS UNTIL THE MIDTERMS, THESE ARE THE LATEST EARLY VOTING NUMBERS CREEPING UP ON IT NOW 38 MILLION PEOPLE, MOSTLY REGISTERED DEMOCRATS HAVE CAST THEIR MAIL IN, AS WELL AS IN PERSON BALLOTS NATIONWIDE. BUT POLLING AVERAGES CONTINUE TO FAVOR REPUBLICANS TAKING CONTROL OF THE SENATE, AS WELL AS THE HOUSE. THIS ACCORDING TO PROJECTIONS FROM REAL CLEAR POLITICS. MEANWHILE FORMER PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA STUMPED FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE IN PENNSYLVANIA, WITH JOHN FETTERMAN MAKING HIS CASE TO BE SENT TO THE CAPITOL. AND IN MICHIGAN, INCUMBENT GOVERNOR MERRICK GRETCHEN WHITMER, IS MAKING HER FINAL CAMPAIGN ROUNDS. THE REAL CLEAR POLITICS HAS WHITMER READING BY 4.4 POINTS. THEY'RE ALSO ON THE BALLOT, A CONSEQUENTIAL REFERENDUM THAT WILL DECIDE IF ABORTION PROTECTIONS WILL BE ENSHRINEMENT IN THAT STATE'S CONSTITUTION. AND BC'S SHIRT AND -- JULIE WELCOME. TELL ME HOW VOTERS ARE FEELING ABOUT MICHIGAN ESSENTIALLY COULD BECOMING A GROUND ZERO IN THE FIGHT FOR ABORTION RIGHTS?  YEAH, ALEX, THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. LOOK, DEMOCRATS SEE THIS ELASTIC EFFORT IN THE DAYS LEADING UP TO ELECTION DAY IN THE FIGHT TO PROTECT ABORTION RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THE POINT TO THE FACT THAT MANY VOTERS ACTUALLY PUT A PROPOSAL THREE ON THE BALLOT, THAT MEASURE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY ENSHRINE PUSH ABORTION PROTECTION INTO MICHIGAN STATES CONSTITUTION. INDICATIVE REASONS THAT THAT MEASURE WILL PASS, AND THE DEMOCRATS WILL STORE DEGRADES UP ANOTHER TICKETS. BUT TODAY, WE HAVE MAJOR, GET OUT THE VOTE EFFORTS INCLUDING ALL THE PRESIDENTS OF THE PRO-CHOICE EFFORTS GORDIE JOINING GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER AND OTHER DEMOCRATS, AND SECRETARY OF STATE SHOOTOUT WHY ABORTION IS KEY IN THE COMING DAYS. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT THEY TOLD ME.  WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THEY WILL VOTE YES ON PROPERTY. WE KNOW THAT THEY CARE ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE FREEDOM. WE KNOW THAT THEY CARE ABOUT ENSURING THAT THEIR STATE DOES NOT GO. BACKWARDS  WOMEN OF COLOR ARE THE MOST AFFECTED OF OUR BODIES AGREE REGIONAL SPANS.  THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRADITIONALLY ANTI CHOICE, WHO ARE VOTING YES TO PRESERVE THIS RIGHT BECAUSE THE ALTERNATIVE IS SO EXTREME, AND SO CRUEL.  YEAH, THAT WAS GOVERNOR WHITMER THERE AT THE END. I ASKED HER WHY THEY'RE FOCUSING ON ABORTION, EVEN AS REPUBLICANS. ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST MONTH CONTINUE TO BLANKET THE AIRWAVES WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS, WITH SOME MISINFORMATION CONCERNING NUMBER THREE. ONE STUDENT MISSION IN STATE, SHE ALSO VOTED ALREADY VOTED BECAUSE ABORTION IS SO IMPORTANT FOR HER. -- IT'LL BE AN ECONOMIC RACE AS WE GET DOWN TO THE FINISH LINE HERE.  OKAY, JULIE TSIRKIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT UPDATE FROM LANSING MICHIGAN. JOINING ME RIGHT NOW IS MICHIGAN'S VERY OWN MICHAEL MORE. I GOTTA SAY THE WHOLE COMPLETE LIKES TO CLAIM HIM BASED ON HIS EXPERTISE IN FILMMAKER AND HOST OF THE VERY ENTERTAINING, ALWAYS RUMBLE WITH MICHAEL MORE PODCAST. MIKE WAS ALSO HAVING A SUBSTACK NEWSLETTER. WELCOME, MY FRIEND. FIRST OFF, I WANT YOUR REACTION TO WHAT YOU'RE HEARING TODAY FROM THE VOTERS, AND FROM GOVERNOR WHITMER WHO'S REALLY COMING UP AGAINST THAT TRUMP ENDORSED REPUBLICAN TUTOR DIXON. WHAT'S GOING ON THERE IN YOUR STATE?  I'M NOT WORRIED AT ALL. THIS IS, I THINK THAT THIS IS JUST A THING WHERE PEOPLE GET NERVOUS, ESPECIALLY DEMOCRATS AND LIBERALS GET REALLY NERVOUS. WE KNOW WHAT THE APPOINTMENT CAN DO, DOES THE, AND WE KNOW THE VERY COMMITTED AND ALL THAT. AS JULIE JUST POINTED OUT, IN THE HISTORY OF BALLOT PROPOSALS IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, THERE HAS BEEN NEVER A BAD PROPOSAL THAT HAS GOTTEN THIS MANY SIGNATURES TO GET ON THE BALLOT. IT WAS SO OVERWHELMING AND IT TOLD US THE SAME THING THAT KANSAS TOLD US BACK IN THE SUMMER, THAT EVEN KANSAS, ALMOST 60% OF THE PEOPLE IN KANSAS VOTED TO KEEP THE RIGHT TO HAVE AN ABORTION IN THEIR STATE CONSTITUTION. KANSAS. WE'VE HAD SIGN, AFTER SIGN ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHETHER IT'S THE DEMOCRAT SARAH PALIN IN THE FIRST RUNOFF, THEY'RE IN ALASKA, NATIVE ALASKA WOMAN. I WAS BORN MAYBE A YEAR BEFORE ALASKA BECAME ESTATES. I COULDN'T READ OR WRITE FOR A FEW YEARS, BUT I DON'T MEMBER A DEMOCRAT EVER BEING THE SOLE CONGRESS PERSON FROM ALASKA. HOW DID THAT HAPPEN? THIS IS BEEN GOING ON, MOST OF THE YEAR, AND THEN THE POLLING FROM -- I JUST WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THE WARNING OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN 2016, THE NEW YORK TIMES, NOT A CONSERVATIVE NEWSPAPER SAID THAT HILLARY WAS GOING TO WIN THAT DAY, 85% CHANCE OF HER WINNING, ONLY 15% CHANCE OF TRUMP WINNING IN THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, ON ELECTION DAY. THE SAME THING HAPPENED IN MICHIGAN, IN THE 16 PRIMARY BETWEEN BERNIE AND HILLARY. THAT MORNING, THE CHANNEL TO NEWS IN DETROIT SAID THAT HILLARY WAS GOING TO BEAT BERNIE BY 26 POINTS, AND 12 HOURS LATER, BERNIE WINS THE MICHIGAN PRIMARY BY TWO POINTS OVER HILLARY. YOU JUST GOTTA JUMP ALL THE STUFF ON YOUR HEAD. DON'T BE IN A PLACE OF DESPAIR. TRUST THAT YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS DO NOT WANT TO GO BACKWARDS.  AND I WANT TO ALSO ADD YOUR VOICE TO WHAT HAPPENED IN 2016, BECAUSE YOU FROM THE GET-GO, WERE SAYING TRUMP WOULD WIN. AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WENT AGAINST THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE DIFFERENT POLES AND DIFFERENT ANALYSTS. WHAT JUST HAPPENED. WHY ARE YOU SO OPTIMISTIC IN GENERAL? WHAT ARE THE TAILWIND THAT YOU ARE FEELING, THAT KEEPS YOU FEELING THAT DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO ARCANE THESE MIDTERMS?  FIRST OF, ALL I DON'T LIVE IN A BUBBLE. I SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF MY TIME IN THE MIDWEST. EACH OF THE COUNTRY MAKING MY FILMS, OR WHATEVER. SO, I MEAN I PAY TENSION AND LISTEN TO PEOPLE. IT'S -- IT WASN'T JUST THE 16 ELECTION. THE NIGHT I WAS WHEN THE OSCAR AND GO ON STAGE AND SAID, I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S THE FOURTH NIGHT OF THE IRAQ WAR, AND WE'RE NOT GONNA FIND ANY WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. I GOT BOOED OFF THE STAGE. I WAS THINKING, WHY DID I SAY? THAT I'M NOT WEAPONS INSPECTOR, I WOULD DO I KNOW? I'M REALLY JUST LIKE A LOT OF BASIC EVERYDAY AMERICANS, A POTENTIAL WHAT'S GOING ON, AND IT WAS CLEAR TO ME IN THE MIDWEST THAT TRUMP WAS GOING TO WIN. THE ONLY WAY HE WASN'T GOING TO WIN, IS IF WE GOT THE VOTE OUT FOR HILLARY, AND SHE LOST MICHIGAN BY TWO VOTES PER PRECINCT, THAT'S IT. THAT'S HOW CLOSE THIS CAN BE THIS -- EXCUSE ME WHILE I'M OPTIMISTIC, I'M VERY OPTIMISTIC BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE DEMOCRATS REGISTER TO VOTE IN THIS COUNTRY, THAN THERE ARE REPUBLICANS BY ABOUT 20 MILLION. BIDEN WON BY 7 MILLION, THE POPULAR VOTE. HILLARY WON THE POPULAR VOTE BY 3 MILLION, SO IT -- WHAT WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE ALL OF A SUDDEN, ALL THESE MILLIONS OF DEMOCRATS ON TUESDAY, ARE GONNA WANT TRUMP BACK?  BUT HANG ON A SECOND. YOUR KITCHEN TABLES KIND OF GUY, RIGHT? I MEAN YOU'RE DESCRIBING YOURSELF, YOU'RE NOT IN THE BUBBLE.  MAYBE TOO MUCH OF THE KITCHEN. TABLE  [LAUGHS] WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT VOTERS IF THE KITCHEN TABLE ISSUES LIKE HIGHER GAS AND FOOD PRICES --  I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TREATED LIKE THEY'RE BUNCH OF DUMMIES. WE'RE NOT IDIOTS. OKAY NO BRENNAN, THERE'S 303 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY, MAYBE A EVEN GOOD 80 AND 90 MILLION ARE NOT VERY BRIGHT, NO OFFENSE TO THOSE OF YOU WATCHING THAT ARE NOT RIGHT. BUT YOU'RE NOT RIGHT, SO MAKING AN ASSUMPTION THAT YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. BUT THERE ARE OVER 200 MILLION OF US THAT ARE. STUPID WHEN MONICA TELL PEOPLE THAT GAS PRICES, OH PRICE OF EGGS, YEAH I'M -- IF YOU'RE WOMAN I'M USING, I'M JUST GONNA GIVE UP I'M GONNA GIVE UP MY RIGHTS. MY BODILY AUTONOMY RIGHTS, TO TAKE THOSE PARTS OF EXAMINE ANOTHER 20 CENTS. THAT IS NOT HOW PEOPLE THINK. THEY LOVE THIS COUNTRY, THEY LOVE THIS DEMOCRACY, THEY CAN DO NOT WANT TO LOSE IT ON TUESDAY. AGAIN THERE'S NOTHING --  AND I AGREE WITH YOU. BUT I WAS LISTENING TO A CORRESPONDENT BASED IN GEORGIA WHO IS BRINGING US SOUNDBITES FROM PEOPLE IN TERMS OF HOW THEY WERE GOING TO VOTE, WEATHER IS GOING TO BE FOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK, HERSCHEL WALKER. YOU HAD SOMEONE SAYING ABOUT HERSCHEL WALKER THAT GUY WAS GREAT ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD, AMAZING. BUT POLITICS IS NOT HIS ARENA. THAT'S WHY SHE WAS VOTING FOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK. AND THEN THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN THAT SAID, YOU KNOW, THINGS JUST AREN'T WORKING SO I JUST WANT CHANGE, SO I'M GONNA VOTE FOR HERSCHEL WALKER, BECAUSE I JUST NEED CHANGE IN THE HOPE THAT SOMETHING IS GOING TO CHANGE AND MAKE MY LIFE BETTER, MY CIRCUMSTANCES BETTER. WHEN YOU SAY TO THAT?  WELL, YOUR CIRCUMSTANCES ARE NOT GONNA GET IT THAT WAY. LET ME JUST SAY FIRST OF ALL THE REPUBLICANS HAVE NOT REPRESENTED ONE IOTA OF A PLAN TO BRING DOWN INFLATION, TO HELP THE ECONOMY. THERE IS A HEALTHY ECONOMY, WHAT KIND -- THIS IS AN ECONOMY THAT'S GOT LESS THAN THREE AND A HALF PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT. THE STOCK MARKET THIS WEEK HAD ITS BEST MONTH, THE MONTH OF OCTOBER, THEN ANY MONTH OF ANY YEAR SINCE 1976. SO THE REPUBLICANS ARE VERY GOOD AT THE SPIN AND THE PROPAGANDA, AND I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NOW NOT TO FALL FOR THAT. WE HAVE TOO MUCH AT STAKE ON TUESDAY. AND THEY'RE JUST NOT GOING TO GO WITH THIS. THE HARVARD STUDY JUST CAME OUT, THEY BELIEVE 40% OF YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO VOTE. 40? IN 2014, 15 15% OF YOUNGER PEOPLE VOTE. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GONNA VOTE. WOMEN ARE GONNA VOTE WITH PENSIONS. AND PEOPLE OF COLOR KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE. SO, NOT THAT IS NOT GOING TO BE CLOSE, AND WE WILL LOSE IF WE DON'T SHOW UP. WE WILL LOSE, IF WE DON'T NEED TO BRING FIVE PEOPLE WITH US TO THE POLLS. WE HAVE WORK TO, TODAY, TOMORROW AND MONDAY TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY WE KNOW AND LOVE GETS TO THE POLLS. THERE ARE 80 MILLION MILLION VOTERS -- WE JUST HAVE TO REJOIN -- JUST AS A FAVOR JUST THIS ONCE, YOU CAN GO BACK TO NON VOTING. IF YOU'RE UPSET WITH BIDEN, YOU KNOW, THEN LET'S GET A STRONG DEMOCRATIC SENATE IN THERE AND THOSE DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT BIDEN FULFILLS HIS CAMPAIGN PROMISES. SO THAT'S THE WAY TO GET CHANGE, IS TO KEEP THE HOUSE IN THE DEMOCRATIC SAINTS. LET'S ELECT A LITTLE MORE DEMOCRATIC SENATORS, AND JUST IMAGINE THE GOOD THINGS THAT ARE GOING TO HAPPEN, AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE WANT, THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WANT PAID FAMILY LEAVE, THEY DON'T THINK THE MINIMUM WAGE SHOULD BE $7 AND SOMETHING AN HOUR. THEY DON'T AGREE WITH ANY OF THAT. THE WAY TO FIX THAT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO RUIN THIS DEMOCRACY -- I JUST CAN'T FOR THE LIFE OF ME, ALEX, BELIEVE THAT MY FELLOW AMERICANS ARE GOING TO SHOW UP ON TUESDAY, AND VOTE FOR THE PARTY THAT JUST HOURS AFTER THE INSURRECTION ON JANUARY SIX, JUST HOURS, 147 REPUBLICANS VOTED TO OVERTURN THE LEGITIMATE ELECTION OF JOE BIDEN. HOURS. THEY JOINED THE INSURRECTIONISTS. I NEVER -- I MEAN WE'VE ALL -- GROWING UP MY GRANDFATHER WAS THE HEAD OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IN THE TOWN I GREW UP IN, REPUBLICANS ARE NOT BAD PEOPLE, THEY WERE NEVER BY PEOPLE, WE HAD DISAGREEMENTS, WE DIDN'T AGREE ON THINGS, BUT WHAT IS GOING ON THAT YOU WOULD BRING YOURSELF INTO THAT VOTING BOOTH, AND SAY YOU KNOW WHO I WANT? I WANT TO THE PEOPLE WHO TRIED TO STAGE A KOOK IN THIS COUNTRY. I DON'T BELIEVE IT!  WHAT I HEAR YOU DOING RIGHT NOW IS ECHOING THE SENTIMENTS OF JOE BIDEN RIGHT NOW AND TELLING FOLKS, HEY FOLKS, HE USES THAT MONIKER ALL THE TIME. DEMOCRACY IS ON THE LINE HERE. AND YOU'RE ECHOING THE REASONS FOR WHICH HE IS SAYING THAT. HE SAYING THAT AS WELL. BUT THERE IS SOMEBODY ELSE WHO MAY BE JUMPING INTO THINGS. YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT DONALD TRUMP WITH THESE 2024 NON ANNOUNCEMENT ANNOUNCEMENT THAT HE MIGHT HAVE COMING IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO, IF THAT DATE THAT WE WERE -- INSIDE THE TOP THERE. IF THAT HAPPENS, WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT IMPACT HAS ON THE MIDTERMS, THE POST, THE WAY PEOPLE LOOK AT THIS COUNTRY AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS?  YEAH. I'M KIND OF GLAD IS GONE NOW THAT HE'S GOING TO MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT VERY SOON BECAUSE THAT WILL HELP GET OUT THE VOTE OF THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS WHO DON'T WANT HIM. THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS IN 2020 MADE CLEAR -- IN THE LAST TWO YEAR. IT'S NOT JUST GOING CRAZY AFTER WATCHING THE IPHONE GUY TOO MANY TIMES ON FOX NEWS, THEY DECIDED THAT I VOTED FOR BIDEN BUT NOW I WANT THIS GUY BACK. THAT IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN. I DID NOT BELIEVE MY FELLOW AMERICANS, I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS COUNTRY IS AN IDIOT NOTION. THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I THINK TRUMP WANTED TO JUMP IN AND PUT IT OUT THERE. THE REPUBLICANS DID NOT WANT HIM PUTTING THIS OUT HERE, I'M SURE HE IS SAYING THIS. I'M GUESSING SOMEBODY, DON JUNIOR HAS SOME TYPE OF TERRITORIES OR DOZENS ANYTHING ELSE. FOR HIM TO GO OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS AND ABOUT BEING THE SENATOR OF ATTENTION. THAT'S JUST NOT HIS. WELL  OH YEAH. AND HE'S GOING TO BE TALKING TONIGHT TO.  I HOPE HE ANNOUNCES A TONIGHT THAN.  WELL -- LET'S SEE IF THAT HAPPENS. I NEED A QUICK ANSWER ON PREDICTIONS, I'M JUST GONNA LET YOU BE THE MAJOR PROGNOSTICATOR HERE. BOY WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME. TOP SENATE RACES WE'RE GONNA GO THROUGH VERY QUICKLY, [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHS]  YOU DO NOT GO TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL, YOU DO NOT HAVE NUNS TEACHER? IS THAT THE PROBABLE? IT'S A KILLER SO WE CAN. PERSON  [LAUGHS] 'S FETTERMAN A DUNNVILLE?  AGAIN, GIVING THE PEOPLE OF TRANSYLVANIA ARE NOT GONNA VOTE FOR JOHN FETTERMAN BECAUSE HE HAD A STROKE AND HE'S RECOVERING. WE ARE GOOD PEOPLE, WE DON'T SAY, WELL WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM? WHY CAN'T HE SPEAK BETTER YET? WELL BECAUSE HE'S RECOVERING FROM A STROKE. HOW IS HE EVEN STANDING IS WHAT I WANT TO? NO I MEAN THIS IS AMAZING. BUT PEOPLE ARE KIND. YOU DON'T LIKE, GREG ABBOTT, WHAT'S HE DOING IN A CHAIR? WHY DOESN'T HE STAND UP AT THE PODIUM? WE DON'T SAY THAT.  THAT'S A GOOD POINT.  THAT WOULD BE SO WRONG?  TOTALLY WRONG?  WE LOVE PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED, WHO ARE HAVING A HARD GO OF IT AT LIFE, SO MANY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS EVENT HARD GOERS -- WHEN THEY SEE SOMEBODY LIKE JOHN FETTERMAN GOING FORWARD BECAUSE WHY, WHAT'S HE GOT BECAUSE HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY? WOW. NO NO. IT'S GONNA BE FINE, WE'RE GONNA BE FINE IF HE WAS MY PREDICTION, WE WILL WIN IF EVERYBODY VOTES ON OUR SIDE. BECAUSE HE WANTS -- THOSE MORE VOTES THAN THERE ARE. THEM IF WE MAKE TO THE POLLS, AND IF WE MAKE CALLS TO FRIENDS AND RELATIVES THIS WEEKEND, IF YOU DON'T DO THAT REMAIN WHEN. IT'S UP TO EVERYBODY WATCHING THIS RIGHT NOW, OR THEY'RE GOING TO DO IN THE EUNUCHS 48, OR 72 HOURS.  ANNOUNCES A ROCK REALLY QUICKLY, MARK ELLIOT -- MARKEL IN ARIZONA?  YES OF COURSE. HE'S MARK KELLY.  I KNOW, HE'S COOL.  AGAIN, THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA ARE NOT STUPID. THEY HAVE HEARD WITH BLAKE MASTER HAS SAID, HE'S ONE OF MY SUB START CALM -- HE'S WHAT I CALLED A WACKADOODLES TEN. THE TEN MOST OUTRAGEOUS PEOPLE RUNNING FOR OFFICE AND BLAKE MASTERS IS ONE OF THE. THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA ARE GOOD PEOPLE. THEY'RE SMART PEOPLE. THEY WANT TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE ARE PAYING A LIVING WAGE. THEY WANT TO LIVE IN A PLACE WHERE IF YOUR MOTHER, SICK IF YOUR CHILD IS SICK, YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LOSING A WEEK'S PAY. THAT'S A COUNTRY WE ARE. THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO LIVE IN, AND WE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO THE OLD. WE'RE  GOOD. ALL RIGHT, SPEAKING, COOL YOUR COOL THANK YOU FOR SPENDING TIME WITH US. IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE. IT COMES HIM AGAIN.  THANK YOU, APPRECIATED. GOOD LUCK EVERYBODY.  THANKS! WHAT TO LOOK FOR HOUR BY HOUR ON TUESDAY NIGHT UNFOLD. MY NEXT GUEST HAVE SOME SPECIFIC REASONS HE'S GOING TO BE WATCHING AND WHY YOU SHOULD BE WATCHING HIM TOO. HIM TOO. 20221105174646.902|20221105174913.216",

        "trs": "CLOCK CONTINUES TO TICK DOWN TOWARD ELECTION DAY TOWARD THE FIRST -- ON ELECTION NIGHT. SO, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF THE SENATE AGAIN. REPUBLICANS NEEDING THAT GAIN OF ONE SEAT IF THEY'RE GOING TO FLIP IT IF THEY'RE GONNA GET CONTROL, DEMOCRATS TRY TO KEEP THEM FROM DOING THAT. WE WERE TALKING IN THE LAST BLOCK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT PENNSYLVANIA IS TO DEMOCRATS, BECAUSE IT'S A RED SEAT RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE BIDEN WON THE STATE, SUCH A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY FOR DEMOCRATS TO GET A FLIP AND THEN IF YOU GET A FLIP IF YOU'RE A DEMOCRAT YOU CAN AFFORD A LOSS. WHAT HAPPENS LET'S SAY IF JOHN FETTERMAN THE DEMOCRAT DOES NOT COME THROUGH FOR DEMOCRATS IN PENNSYLVANIA. IF INSTEAD MEHMET OZ WINS THAT RACE, THEN DEMOCRATS ARE LEFT SCRAMBLING BUT WHAT OTHER RED STATE COULD THEY GET AND THAT'S WHERE THEY CAME UP A LITTLE BIT AT THE END OF THE LAST BLOCK THERE. THAT'S WHERE FOR INSTANCE, OHIO COMES IN. AND THE POLLING IN OHIO HAS BEEN PRETTY CLOSE, YOU'VE GOT J.D. VANCE THE REPUBLICAN, YOU GOT TIM RYAN THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSMAN ON AVERAGE. VANCE THE COUPLE POINTS AHEAD. YOU'VE SEEN SOME VERY CLOSE CONSISTENTLY CLOSE POLLS IN THE STATE. A LOT OF FOLKS THINK THAT RYAN HAS BEEN RUNNING A VERY STRONG CAMPAIGN HERE. HERE'S THE X-FACTOR IN OHIO, IT'S HOW BADLY THE POLLS HAVE MISSED IN OHIO. THE LAST COUPLE OF ELECTIONS, WE TALK ABOUT POLLING MISSES ALL THE TIME. THEY'RE NOT EVENLY SPREAD OUT, IN SOME STATES THE POLLING IS ACTUALLY BEEN PRETTY GOOD THE LAST COUPLE OF ELECTIONS. NOT OHIO. IN 2016 AND IN 2020 YOU COULD SEE IT RIGHT HERE, THIS WAS THE FINAL POLL AVERAGE, TRUMP WAS BARELY AHEAD IN OHIO, DEMOCRATS CAME IN TO BOTH ELECTION NIGHT THAT HE HAD THEY HAD A SHOT IN OHIO. TRUMP AND PUTTING THE STATE IN A RUNAWAY. SO, THAT IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS HERE, IS THE POLLING MISSING IN OHIO AGAIN? OR IS THIS FOR REAL? DOES RYAN HAVE A SHOT AT THIS. OUR OWN JESSE CURSES ON THE GROUND IN GLENDALE, OHIO NEAR CINCINNATI. YOU'VE BEEN TALKING THIS LATE RACE CLOSELY. WHAT IS YOUR SENSE OF IT, HOW ARE REPUBLICANS, HOW DEMOCRATS FEEL ABOUT THIS RACE? TODAY FEEL THIS IS LEGITIMATELY A 12 POINT RACE RIGHT NOW.  YEAH, AND I CAN TELL YOU, STEVE, WE HEARD FROM J.D. VANCE HIMSELF POINTING TO PULLING INACCURACIES. OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE JUST LOOKING AT WHAT WE'VE SEEN, HISTORY HAS SHOWN US IN THE PAST IN THE STATE TIM RYAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS RACE. WE'LL TELL YOU THAT HE IS TRUSTING WHAT HE SEES ON THE GROUND. COMPARED TO THE POLLING. BUT MONEY DOESN'T LIE. WE'VE SEEN A HUGE INFUSION OF CASH FROM NATIONAL REPUBLICANS, A GROUP ALONG WITH SENATE MAJORITY MITCH MCCONNELL TO HELP BOOST J.D. VANCE IN RECENT MONTHS. THAT TELLS US AT MINIMUM THEY'RE FOCUSING ON THIS RACE TRYING TO DEFEND THE SEAT FOR REPUBLICANS. WHAT REALLY STOOD OUT TO US ABOUT COVERING THIS BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN RYAN AND VANCE IN RECENT MONTHS. IS THAT UNLIKE OTHER RACES WHERE YOU'VE SEEN DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES STRESSING ISSUES LIKE ELECTION INTEGRITY AND ABORTION FOR TIM RYAN. CONGRESSMAN RIGHT NOW. HE'S REALLY ZEROED IN ON THE ECONOMY, SPECIFICALLY BUZZWORDS OF JOBS, WORKERS CHINA. PROBABLY THREE OF THE WORDS WE HEAR THE MOST FROM HIM. HE CALLS HIS CAMPAIGN BUS THE WORKERS FIRST EXPRESS. AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS RACE, WE SEE J.D. VANCE TALKING ABOUT INFLATION, TYING THAT TO DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND, TYING RYAN TO THOSE POLICIES AS TIM RYAN TRIES TO KEEP THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY AT ARMS LENGTH. WE CAUGHT UP WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TODAY, ASKED THEM WHAT THEIR MESSAGING WOULD BE FOR UNDECIDED WORKERS WORKING IN MANUFACTURING, HERE'S PART OF WHAT THEY TOLD US.  FOR A FACTORY WORKER, THE THING THAT I'D SAY IS, WE'RE GONNA LOSE EVERY FACTORY JOB IN THIS COUNTRY UNLESS WE HAVE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. ENERGY INDEPENDENCE IS THE CORE THING WE NEED TO BRING MANUFACTURING BACK TO THIS COUNTRY.  WE'LL WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT J.D. VANCE HAS TO DONORS WITH 55 MILLION, MITCH MCCONNELL, PETER TILL. BOUGHT AND PAID FOR. TIM RYAN 445,000 DONORS, 95% OF CONTRIBUTIONS ARE UNDER 100 BUCKS. WHO'S FOUR WHO.  AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH, STEVE, THE VANCE CAMPAIGN TELLS US THAT THEY HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DONORS AS WELL. BUT YOU SEE THE POSTURING THERE IN THE FINAL DAYS, AND AGAIN, THIS IS RIGHT IN THE HEARTLAND OBVIOUSLY WHERE MANUFACTURING IS KEY, AND WE'RE SEEING MORE JOBS COMING BACK, SO IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHO PEOPLE GIVE CREDIT FOR THE GOOD THAT'S DONE ECONOMICALLY WHEN YOU SEE THOUSANDS OF JOBS COMING HERE IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AND YEARS AHEAD BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE THE INFLATIONARY WOES AS, WELL I WILL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR, THAT WILL FIND OUT ON TUESDAY.  ALL RIGHT, JASON KIRSCH IN OHIO, THANK YOU FOR THAT IN A 7:30 POLL CLOSING TIME IN OHIO. ONE OF THOSE STATES WE COULD BE GETTING A PRETTY EARLY READOUT ON HOW THE NIGHT GOING. FOR PORTENDING AT LEAST ELSEWHERE. SO, FROM OHIO, WE'RE TALKING AGAIN HERE ABOUT THE SENATE MAP. HOW ABOUT WISCONSIN. REMEMBER ONE OF THOSE VULNERABLE RED SEATS RON JOHNSON THE REPUBLICAN RUNNING FOR A THIRD TERM. AND THIS IS A STATE, YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS CAME INTO THE YEAR THINKING OF ALL THESE RED STATES, WISCONSIN MIGHT BE THEIR BEST CHANCE AT A FLIP. RON JOHNSON HAS ALWAYS BEEN A POLARIZING FIGURE IN WISCONSIN, BARELY WON REELECTION IN 2016. IT WAS A BIG SURPRISE THAT HE DID. THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE IN THE POLLING IN WISCONSIN. YOU SEE THE NEWEST POLL OUT, OF WISCONSIN, IT IS JOHNSON AHEAD BY TWO POINTS BUT THIS POLL, I WANT TO SHOW YOU INSIDE OF IT. IT REFLECTS A SHIFT BECAUSE OVER THE SUMMER IN SEPTEMBER THIS IS THE SPECTRUM NEWS AND THE COLLEGE POLL LOOK HOW UNPOPULAR JOHNSON WAS IN WISCONSIN OVER THE SUMMER. 37 FAVORABLE, 50 UNFAVORABLE'S DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT MANDELA BARNES WAS ACTUALLY ABOVE WATER, WILL NOW, WITH JOHNSON LEADING IN THE POLLS HE'S TICKED UP BY SIX POINTS. 'S FAVORABLE RATING AND THEN BELLA BARNES IS UNFAVORABLE HAS GONE UP NEARLY TEN POINTS. SO, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE JOHNSON CAMPAIGN SPENDING HEAVILY, REALLY EMPHASIZING THE ISSUE OF CRIME. AND REALLY SEEMS TO HAVE PERHAPS CHANGED PERCEPTIONS OF THESE CANDIDATES, AND NO LONGER IS WISCONSIN A DEMOCRATS TOP TARGET IN TERMS OF FLIPPING A SEAT. THEY'RE STILL IN THE GAME, IT DOESN'T LOOK NECESSARILY AS ROSY FOR THEM AS IT DID A FEW MONTHS AGO. SHAQ BREWSTER IS ON THE GROUND FOR US IN MILWAUKEE, SHAQ, I WONDER IF YOU COULD TALK TO US ABOUT THOSE DYNAMICS. THIS IS STILL VERY MUCH A CLOSE GAME, BUT IT APPEARS THAT RON JOHNSON HAS MOVED TO THIS CAMPAIGN, THE DISCUSSION TO SOME ISSUES WHERE HE HAS SOME STRENGTH OVER BARNES, THE DEMOCRATS MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN EXPECTING?  RIGHT. NO, THAT'S EXACTLY THE CASE, STEVE. AND THIS IS BEEN A BUSY WEEK HERE IN WISCONSIN. IT STARTED WITH THE RELEASE OF THOSE POLLS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT, THOSE ARE THE GOLD STANDARD POLLS, BOTH CAMPAIGNS ARE TELL YOU WILL TIP A ATTENTION TO THEM. THE GOVERNORS LEVEL WE THOUGHT THINGS WERE TIED AND THEN IT WHAT WE SAW THERE WITH THE SENATE RACE. SENATOR RON JOHNSON HAS THAT TWO POINT LEAD, IT'S WELL WITHIN THE MARGIN OF ERROR, AND IT'S TIGHTER THAN WHAT WE SAW EVEN JUST LAST MONTH. BECAUSE OF THAT, ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, WE'VE BEEN SEEING THE ATTACKS CONTINUE TO ESCALATE, SENATOR RON JOHNSON GETTING MORE PERSONAL, SAYING THAT LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR MANDELA BARNES HAS TO SUSTAINED IN CONTEMPT FOR HIS COUNTRY AND FOR WISCONSIN NIGHTS. LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR BARNES FIRING BACK AND SAYING, SENATOR RON JOHNSON IS IN IT FOR HIMSELF. HE CHANGES TAX POLICIES FOR THE SIMPLE BENEFIT OF HIMSELF AND HIS DONORS. YOU SEE THOSE ATTACKS FLYING, AND YOU ALSO STARTING TO SEE SOME DOUBT, AT LEAST BEING RAISED BY ONE OF THE CANDIDATES, SENATOR RON JOHNSON, ABOUT ELECTION RESULTS. I ASKED HIM AFTER AN EVENT EARLIER THIS WEEK, WHETHER OR NOT HE WOULD ACCEPT THE ELECTION RESULTS ON TUESDAY. HE ESSENTIALLY TOLD ME, IT DEPENDS. HE POINTED TO A STORY OUT OF GREEN BAY WITH THE REPUBLICAN LAWSUIT AGAINST ELECTION WORKERS THERE. AND THEN THE FIRING OF AN ELECTION WORKER HERE IN MILWAUKEE. TO SAY THAT THERE IS SOME DOUBT THERE, THE DEMOCRATS IN HIS WORDS, ARE CHEATING IN THIS ELECTION. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT DEMOCRATS IN THE STATE HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUSHING BACK ON, IT'S BEEN A BUSY WEEK AND WE KNOW IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET MORE INTENSE AS WE GET CLOSER TO ELECTION DAY, STEVE.  ALL RIGHT, SHAQ BREWSTER IN WISCONSIN, THE ALWAYS SWING STATE OF WISCONSIN. JACK, THANKS FOR THAT. WE GOT MORE, NORTH CAROLINA, NEVADA, THE STATE THAT COULD KEEP US WAITING ALL WEEK. MORE FROM THE BATTLEGROUND SENATE STATES RIGHT AFTER THIS. SENATE STATES RIGHT AFTER THIS 20221105022955.559|20221105023249.133",

        "trs": "ALL RIGHT, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE STATES WHERE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO PLAY OFF EVENTS, LOOK AT THE SENATE BATTLEGROUND MAP HERE. STATES WHERE DEMOCRATS ARE TRYING TO FLIP REPUBLICAN SEATS HERE. LET'S LOOK AT IT FROM THE OTHER ANGLE, LOOK AT DEMOCRATS ARE MOST VULNERABLE HERE. GEORGIA, THAT RACE IN GEORGIA HAS BEEN TIGHT ALL YEAR. TAKE A LOOK THOUGH, THE DYNAMIC IN GEORGIA IS THE DYNAMIC RIGHT NOW OF POTENTIAL SPLIT TICKET VOTING. SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE EXTINCT IN OUR POLITICS. BUT IN THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR, YOU SEE BRIAN KEMP THE REPUBLICAN INCUMBENT, HE'S LEADING IN THE POLL AVERAGE BY EIGHT POINTS OVER STACEY ABRAMS. HE'S OVER 50%, MEANWHILE, THE REPUBLICAN HERSCHEL WALKER IN THE SENATE RACE RUNNING NEARLY FIVE AND A HALF POINTS BEHIND BRIAN KEMP. AND ACTUALLY BEHIND IN THE POLL AVERAGE RAPHAEL WARNOCK, THE DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT. IT'S AN INTERESTING DYNAMIC HERE, TRUMP OF COURSE, DONALD TRUMP WENT TO WAR POLITICALLY WITH BRIAN KEMP EARLIER THIS YEAR. IN A REPUBLICAN PRIMARY, KEMP SURVIVED. DID THAT WIN HIM OVER SOME OF THOSE TRUMP SKEPTICAL SUBURBAN VOTERS OUTSIDE ATLANTA? HERSCHEL WALKER MAY BE HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH. COULD SPLIT TICKET VOTING SAVE A SENATE SEAT FOR DEMOCRATS, OUR OWN -- IS COVERING THE GEORGIA RACE, JOINS US NOW FROM GEORGIA. WE HAVE THIS X FIRE OF -- A POTENTIAL RUNOFF IN GEORGIA, BRING THAT ASIDE FOR ME FOR A MINUTE, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE DYNAMIC OF, THERE'S THIS GROUP OF VOTERS WHO ARE CLEARLY READY TO VOTE REPUBLICAN IN THE GOVERNOR'S RACE. BUT SO FAR, THE WEEKEND BEFORE THE ELECTION, HAVE NOT BEEN PERSUADED BY HERSCHEL WALKER. WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE? AND WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO DECIDE HOW THEY ULTIMATELY CAST THEIR VOTES?  STEVE, THIS RACE IS DEAD EVEN. YOU SHOWED ONE POLLING AVERAGE THAT SHOWS THE CONTEST WITHIN A POINT, THERE'S ANOTHER POLLING AVERAGE BY 5:38 THAT SHOWS THE CONTEST AT ONE TENTH OF ONE PERCENTAGE POINT, BETWEEN THE TWO. THAT'S HOW CLOSE IT IS. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT NEITHER CANDIDATE GETS TO 50% REQUIRED BY STATE LAW TO AVOID A RUNOFF. IN WHICH CASE, IT WOULD BE ON DECEMBER 6TH WOULD BE WHEN THAT RUNOFF IS HELD, AND IF DEMOCRATS HOLD THEIR OWN ELSEWHERE, GEORGIA'S RUNOFF COULD ONCE AGAIN DECIDE WHICH PARTY CONTROLS THE UNITED STATES SENATE. NOW, THERE'S NO QUESTION, STEVE, THAT DOWN THE STRETCH HERSCHEL WALKER HAD THE MOMENTUM. HE'S GOT POLITICAL GRAVITY ON HIS SIDE. HE'S IN A STATE WHERE REPUBLICANS HAVE STRUCTURAL ADVANTAGES, AS A REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLD, ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO WHEN PRESIDENTS LOW APPROVAL RATING CONCERNS ABOUT THE ECONOMY ARE PROPELLING HIM ON THE OTHER HAND YOU HAVE RAPHAEL WARNOCK WHO'S SHARPENED HIS ATTACKS LATELY, PORTRAYING HERSCHEL WALKER AS SOMEONE WHO IS UNFIT TO SERVE IN THE SENATE, GIVEN HIS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ISSUES, GIVEN HIS TURBULENT PAST. ALLEGATIONS OF VIOLENCE AND THERE ARE ULTIMATELY THREE QUESTIONS STEVE THAT WILL DECIDE THE OUTCOME OF THIS RACE. AND HOW VOTERS COME DOWN. THE FIRST IS RURAL AREAS. ARE THEY GONNA SHOW A BIG HEAVY TURNOUT, THAT'S A MEGA COUNTRY, REPUBLICANS NEED THAT. THE SECOND QUESTION, ARE DEMOCRATS GOING TO SHOW THE SAME KIND OF FIREPOWER THAT THEY SHOWED IN RECENT CYCLES WHERE THERE REALLY SURGE THEIR OWN TURNOUT. THEY'RE GONNA NEED THAT TO HAVE A SHOT AND BOTH OF THOSE THINGS HAPPEN. AND TO YOUR QUESTION, IT'S GOING TO BE THE SUBURBAN MODERATE COLLEGE EDUCATED VOTERS IN PLACES LIKE WHERE I AM RIGHT NOW, ATLANTA METRO AREA, WHO FLIP FROM REPUBLICAN TO DEMOCRAT WHO ARE CRUCIAL TO JOE BIDEN CARRYING THE STATE IN 2020. AND RAPHAEL WARNOCK US AS WELL SENATOR JOHN -- WINNING GEORGIA AT THAT POINT. THE SINGLE BIGGEST QUESTION HERE COULD BE WHETHER RAPHAEL WARNOCK CAN HOLD ON TO THAT SUBURBAN MODERATE MAYBE CENTER-RIGHT SWING VOTER WHO DOESN'T LIKE THE DIRECTION OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. RAPHAEL WARNOCK HAS TRIED TO APPEAL TO THEM IN PATHS WHERE HE TELLS TESTIMONIALS FROM THOSE TYPES OF VOTERS. SAYING THEY'RE GONNA SUPPORT HIM NOT ONLY IS THAT GONNA BE IMPORTANT IN GEORGIA STEVE IT COULD DECIDE ARIZONA IN PENNSYLVANIA.  FASCINATING SPLIT TICKET VOTING, WE THOUGHT IT WAS A THING OF THE PAST, COULD DECIDE THIS ELECTION. THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND FROM GEORGIA WE TAKE A LOOK AT NORTH CAROLINA, WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE IS THE PRESIDENTIAL RESULT IN 2020 FROM NORTH CAROLINA. REMEMBER THIS ONE KEPT US WAITING FOR ABOUT A WEEK BEFORE WE DECLARED DONALD TRUMP DID CARRY NORTH CAROLINA HERE THE MARGIN WAS BARELY A POINT, AND WHAT'S INTERESTING IS, THAT TRUMP MARGIN WAS DOWN, IT WAS MORE THAN A THREE AND A HALF POINTS IN 2016 JOE BIDEN IN THE DEMOCRATS WERE ABLE TO EAT AWAY IN A LOT OF THAT TRUMP ADVANTAGE THOUGH HE STILL ENDED UP PREVAILING BY 75,000 VOTES, THERE WERE SUBURBS OUTSIDE OF CHARLOTTE OUTSIDE OF RALLY IN PARTICULAR WHERE DEMOCRATS SAW MOVEMENT. AND A TOUGH MIDTERM ENVIRONMENT FOR THEM BUT A STATE WHERE THERE IS GROWTH POTENTIAL IN THE SUBURBS. IT'S GIVEN THEM HOPE, IT'S MAYBE THIS IS A REPUBLICAN HELD SENATE SEAT RICHARD BURR RETIRING THAT THEY COULD PICK UP AND ANTONIO HILL A REPORTER IS ON THE GROUND IN NORTH CAROLINA. AND IN TONYA, I KNOW YOU CAUGHT UP WITH BOTH CHERI BEASLEY THE DEMOCRAT AND TED -- THE REPUBLICAN. A RACE THAT'S FLOWN A LITTLE BIT UNDER THE RADAR NATIONALLY, BUT AGAIN, IN A STATE WHERE IT'S VERY TIGHT IN 2020.  THAT'S RIGHT, STEVE. I SPENT SOME TIME WITH BOTH OF THEM TODAY IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE STATE. FOR REPRESENTATIVE BUD THAT MEANT BEING FRIENDLY TERRITORY, SOME RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT OVERWHELMINGLY WENT FOR TRUMP. HE'S TALKING TO VOTERS IN MOST CASES HAD ALREADY VOTED FOR HIM, AND HIS MESSAGE TO THEM WAS TO TRY AND GET OTHER PEOPLE IN THESE RURAL AREAS WHO MAY STILL BE ON THE SIDELINES OR FORGOT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MIDTERMS, TO THE POLLS AS FAST AS THEY CAN. CHERI BEASLEY WAS HERE IN THESE SAME AREAS, AGAIN, THESE PLUS 36 TRUMP COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE. AND SHE HAS REALLY TAKEN A UNIQUE STRATEGY FOR DEMOCRATS, WHO NORMALLY IN NORTH CAROLINA SPENT ALMOST ALL THEIR TIME AND URBAN CENTERS, JUST TRYING TO DRIVE THEIR NUMBERS UP THERE. BUT SHE'S GOT A DIFFERENT TACTIC GOING ON HERE. SHE'S TRYING TO GET SOME OF THESE VOTERS SOME OF THESE DEMOCRATS AND SOME OF THESE BLACK VOTERS WHO LIVE IN THESE RURAL COUNTIES OFTEN GET IGNORED, AND DRIVE THEM TO THE POLLS. THAT'S WHAT SHE THINKS IS GOING TO HELP HER GET THIS WINNING COALITION THAT PEOPLE IN HER VIEW, MAYBE SLEEPING ON. RIGHT NOW. TAKE A LISTEN TO MY CONVERSATION WITH BOTH CANDIDATES, I HAD A WIDE-RANGING CONVERSATION WITH BOTH OF THEM FROM EVERYTHING FROM ABORTION IN THE ECONOMY TO THE THREATS OF DEMOCRACY AND HOW VOTERS ARE FEELING ABOUT BOTH OF THESE CANDIDATES RIGHT NOW. TAKE A LOOK.  WHAT ABOUT ABORTION RESTRICTIONS, THIS IS THE NUMBER TWO QUESTION I GET. WHAT WOULD THE IDEAL ABORTION POLICY OR RESTRICTION LOOK LIKE. AND THAT'S REALLY FOR YOU, BUT ALSO FOR YOU. THE TWO OF YOU WILL BE WORKING TOGETHER.  IT'S NOT WHAT NORTH CAROLINIANS ARE TALKING ABOUT. I TALKED NORTH CAROLINA OR WILL ABOUT ACCESS TO ABORTIONS ALL THE TIME. SO, WHAT WE'RE -- HOW EXTREME THEY ARE. THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRATS WANT. ABORTION AT ANYTIME FOR ANY REASON ALL THE WAY UP TO THE MOMENT OF BIRTH. AND THEY WANT THAT ATTACHMENT EXPENSE, AND THAT IS WILDLY OUT OF STEP WITH NORTH CAROLINIANS.  TED BIDEN'S NATIONAL REPUBLICAN ALLIES HAVE BEEN SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AGAINST ME TO DISTORT MY JUDICIAL RECORD. BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE REALLY CAN WIN THIS RACE. THEY DON'T SPEND THAT KIND OF MONEY UNLESS THEY KNOW. AND WELL TED BUDD IS SET A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS, WHAT HE HASN'T TALKED ABOUT IS WHAT HE'S DONE. HE'S THE ONE WHO'S BEEN IN CONGRESS FOR SIX YEARS, HE SAID EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO WORK HARD TO LOWER COSTS FOR FOLKS HERE IN NORTH CAROLINA. WHICH IS A HUGE ISSUE.  TED BUDD RIGHT NOW IS JUST A BIT AHEAD OF CHERI BEASLEY, THE REALITY IS, THIS RACE IS CLOSER THAN MANY REPUBLICANS WANTED TO BE. OR THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE. AND SO, NEITHER OF THESE CANDIDATES ARE RESTING ON THEIR LAURELS AT THE MOMENT, BOTH OF THEM ARE CIRCLING AROUND ALL 100 COUNTIES, TRYING TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE IN THIS LARGE GROUP OF UNAFFILIATED VOTERS IN THE STATE UNDECIDED VOTERS IN THE STATE AND TRY TO GET THEM TO GET THEIR FRIENDS, THEIR MOM THE GRANDMA TO THE POLLS RIGHT NOW. AND IT'S REALLY, YOU KNOW, AGAIN PEOPLE SAY THIS IS TED BUDD'S RACE TO LOSE. I TRY TO TELL PEOPLE NOT TO SLEEP ON NORTH CAROLINA. BECAUSE OF JUST ALL OF THE SORT OF UNKNOWN FACTORS HERE. THIS IS STEVE A REALLY INTERESTING STATE AND WITH ALL THE NEW VOTERS AND UNDECIDED UNAFFILIATED VOTERS HERE I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME INTERESTING INFORMATION WE GET CLOSER TO TUESDAY.  IN NORTH CAROLINA, ALSO BE INTERESTING JUST BECAUSE THE POLL CLOSING TIME, 7:30 AND A REPORT OUT A TON OF VOTES VERY QUICKLY USUALLY IN NORTH CAROLINA. AGAIN IT COULD BE ONE OF THOSE EARLY INDICATORS FROM NORTH CAROLINA WE HEAD WEST TO THE SILVER STATE, NEVADA. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO, DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT, TRYING TO HOLD ON AGAINST REPUBLICAN ADAM LAXALT. IN THE TRUMP ERA, THE STATE OF NEVADA MOVED IN THE REPUBLICAN DIRECTION. YOU SEE BIDEN WON IT. BLUE STATE IN 2020. ABOUT TWO AND A HALF POINTS. PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS IT WAS IN 2016 BUT LOOKED BEFORE TRUMP CAME ALONG, WE WERE STARTING TO THINK OF NEVADA AS SOMETHING GETTING CLOSE TO A SAFELY BLUE STATE BARACK OBAMA WON IT BY SEVEN POINTS IN HIS REELECTION IN 2012. ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ABOUT TWO AND A HALF REPUBLICANS HAVE FELT FOR A FEW YEARS NOW, THAT THEY ARE ON THE CUSP OF GETTING OVER THE TOP OF NEVADA. THIS IS THE YEAR THEY COULD FINALLY DO IT IT IS THIS THE SENATE RACE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY, IF THEY GET, IT POTENTIALLY GIVE THEM CONTROL OF THE CHAMBER. NO ONE BETTER TO BRING IN HERE THEN FROM NEVADA THERE IS. JOHN RAWLSTON FROM NEVADA. SORRY, I THOUGHT WE DIDN'T HAVE THERE FOR A SECOND. MR. NEVADA POLITICS, JOHN, YOU KNOW NEVADA ELECTIONS YOU'VE SEEN MANY OF THEM. WHAT IS YOUR SENSE, THE WEEKEND BEFORE THIS CAMPAIGN, WHERE THE SENATE RACE STANCE.  STEVE, AS YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME REALLY CLOSE SENATE RACES HERE IN NEVADA. IN FACT HARRY REID, WHO HELD KATHLEEN COTE'S MASTO SEAT BEFORE SHE DID, HAD SOME VERY CLOSE RACES. THIS IS A VERY, VERY CLOSE RACE. IT'S A MID TERM IN A PURPLE STATE. YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE SLIGHT RIGHTWARD TURN THAT THE REPUBLICANS HOPE TO CAPITALIZE ON, THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD IN 2020. NOW, THEY THINK THEY CAN, THERE'S A LOWER TURNOUT, THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT DONE WHAT THEY DID DURING THE REID ERA. WHICH IS BUILD UP THIS LARGE BANK OF EARLY VOTES, PEOPLE DERIDE TRYING TO MAKE PROJECTIONS OF EARLY VOTES, BUT HERE IN NEVADA, AS YOU KNOW, SO MUCH OF THE VOTE IS IN BEFORE ELECTION DAY. OFTEN AT LEAST TWO THIRDS. AND THE DEMOCRATS ONLY HAVE A 1% LEAD STATEWIDE. IN THE EARLY VOTING ENDS TODAY. MAIL BALLOTS CAN COME IN FOR THE NEXT WEEK. AND THIS RACE IS ABOUT AS CLOSE AS ANYONE AS I'VE EVER SEEN. DEMOCRATS ARE OPTIMISTIC THAT SHE CAN HANG ON, BUT REPUBLICANS ARE ALMOST EQUALLY OPTIMISTIC THAT ADAM LAXALT IS GONNA PULL THIS ONE OUT.  JOHN RAWLSTON IN NEVADA, I'M SURE WE'LL CHECK IN WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT OVER THE NEXT WEEK AS THAT NEVADA RACE GETS DECIDED. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. UP NEXT, THE BATTLE FOR CONTROL OF THE HOUSE, READY TO TALK TO SOMEBODY WHOSE JOB IT IS TO KNOW THE POLLS POLITICALLY. IN ALL 435 DISTRICTS. WHAT IS AMY WALTER OF THE POLITICAL REPORT THINK ABOUT WHERE THE BATTLE FOR THE HOUSE STANDS ON THIS WEEKEND BEFORE THE ELECTION, THAT'S NEXT. WEEKEND BEFOR THE ELECTION, THAT'S NT.EX 20221105024536.099|20221105025003.216",

        "trs": "WE'RE HEADING INTO THE FINAL WEEKEND FOR TUESDAY'S MIDTERMS. MANY PEOPLE LOOKING TO THE POLLS BECAUSE THEY ARE ANXIOUS AND WANT TO KNOW THE FUTURE, AS HUMANS ALWAYS DO. THE THING IS, POLLS WILL BE ALL OVER THE PLACE. THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE OVER THE PAST 25 YEARS, PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING LESS AND LESS THE POLLSTERS. BACK IN 2019, PEW RESEARCH CENTER RELEASED THIS CHART SHOWING HOW TELEPHONE RESPONSE RATES, TYPICALLY THE MOST RELIABLE POLLING METHOD, FELL FROM 36% IN 1997, TO JUST SIX FOOT PERCENT IN 2000. 19 LAST NIGHT, -- ONLY 0.4% OF DIALS IN THEIR POLL AT THE TIME YIELDED A COMPLETED INTERVIEW. ADDING, IF YOU ARE EMPLOYED AS ONE OF OUR INTERVIEWERS AT A CALL CENTER, HE WOULD HAVE TO DIAL NUMBERS FOR TWO HOURS TO GET A SINGLE COMPLETE INTERVIEW. GIVEN ALL THAT, THE BEST ESTIMATE WE HAVE IS REPUBLICANS ARE FAVORED TO WIN BUT NOT OVERWHELMINGLY SO. THERE IS A HUGE RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. THAT'S NOT THE MESSAGE ON FOX NEWS, WHICH HAS BEEN TOUTING SURGING REPUBLICANS -- LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES TO CLAIM FRAUD IF THEY LOSE NEXT WEEK. JOINING ME NOW IS CORNELL BELCHER, A POLLSTER AND DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, TALK ABOUT HIS EXPECTATIONS FOR WHERE THE MIDTERMS STAND RIGHT NOW. FIRST, LET'S START ON JUST THE RESPONSE RATE ISSUE AND THE GENERAL RELIABILITY OF POLLING RIGHT NOW. YOUR TAKE AWAY AS A PRACTITIONER.  THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. . -- I LOVE THAT ABOUT YOUR SHOW. PEW RESEARCH HAS BEEN DOING THIS BACK TO 1997, 96 I BELIEVE, STUDYING INFLATION BETWEEN RESPONSE RATES. FRANKLY, THEY HAVE FOUND THAT, THUS FAR,, THE RESPONSE RATES AND SURVEY ACCURACY, VERY LITTLE RELATIONSHIP IN THE FALL RESPONSE RATES AND SURVEY ACCURACY. THAT SAID, AT SOME POINT DO YOU GO OFF A CLIFF, RIGHT? WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO TWO OR LESS PERCENTAGES OF RESPONSE RATE, DOES IT GO OFF A CLIFF? I WILL SAY I HAVE NOT -- IN OUR INTERNAL POLLING HAS GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S LESS OF A RESPONSE RATE. BUT IT IS AN ISSUE. ALTHOUGH, THUS FAR, IT HAS NOT BEEN A HUGE ISSUE. I THINK THE LARGER ISSUE, CHRIS, IS, QUITE FRANKLY, THE ART OF POLLING, NOT THE SCIENCE OF POLLING. I THINK THE SCIENCE OF POLLING IS STILL FUNDAMENTALLY SOUND. BUT THE -- GETTING THE SCIENCE RIGHT DOES NOT MAKE YOU A GOOD POLLSTER. IT DOES NOT MAKE FOR A GOOD POLL. IT'S THE ART OF POLLING. TAKE 2012, FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE LAST WEEK I WAS WORKING ON THE OBAMA CAMPAIGN, IN THE LAST WEEK OF THAT CAMPAIGN OR SO, THE RODNEY FOLKS WERE -- GOING TO PENNSYLVANIA, SPENDING MONEY. DOING ALL THESE OTHER THINGS IN BLUE AREAS THAT WAS VERY CURIOUS. AFTER THE FACT, YOU COME TO FIND OUT A LOT OF REPUBLICANS IN FACT THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE AN ELECTORATE THAT LOOKED MORE LIKE THE BUSH ELECTORATE THAN THE 08 ELECTORATE. WHEN POLLS ARE WRONG, IT IS IN FACT HAPPENING WITH WHAT THEIR EXPECTATIONS OF THE ELECTORATE ARE. WHAT IS THEIR LIKELY VOTER. I WANT TO SAY THIS. THIS IS IMPORTANT, CHRIS. REPUBLICANS HAVE FLOODED THE ZONE WITH POLLS AFTER POLL AFTER POLL. INTERNALLY, DON'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THE ELECTORATE THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST TWO CYCLES. I THINK THERE IS MORE HERE THAT MEETS THE EYE. WHY ARE THEY DOING THIS? THIS IS DIABOLICAL. WE, IN THE NEWS MEDIA, ARE BEGINNING TO FOLLOW THAT NARRATIVE ABOUT THE REPUBLICAN SURGE, HOW EVERYTHING IS LEANING REPUBLICAN. I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, WHEN YOU LOOK AT EARLY VOTING, THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY YOUNG PEOPLE, PARTICIPATING IN THE EARLY VOTE, THIS DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THREE OF THE LAST FOUR MIDTERM ELECTIONS. IT LOOKS LIKE THE OUTLIER OF 2018, WHEN THE OUTLIER OF 20 2018 -- A LOT OF THESE POLLS ARE GONNA BE QUITE FRANKLY OFF. IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE OUR TRADITIONAL MID TERM ELECTORATE LOOKS LIKE.  WE SHOULD SAY, THAT'S THE BIG VARIANCE. WHAT THE ELECTORATE LOOKS LIKE. WE SHOULD ALSO SAY VOTING CHOICES HAVE BECOME SO POLARIZED. IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHAT EARLY VOTING PORTENDS FOR THE SAME DAY. AS A TAKEAWAY, IN THE LAST 40 SECONDS, I'M GETTING FROM YOU THAT YOU THINK THAT THIS IS NOT -- YOU THINK THERE IS A WIDE RANGE OF OUTCOMES POSSIBLE ON TUESDAY.  YES. I DO. BY THE WAY, CHRIS, I'M GONNA GO DEEPER. WE ARE BASTARD'S-ING THE SCIENCE OF PULLING FOR OUR OWN POLITICAL NARRATIVES. THAT HAS BEEN REAL CLEAR WITH HOW WE ARE TRYING TO GET THE STORY FOR THE POLLS. POLLS, CHRIS, WE'RE NEVER CREATED TO GIVE US A HORSE RACE NUMBER. THERE IS MUCH RICHER DATA AND, THEY'RE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT DATA IN THERE. WHAT WE ARE ASKING POLLS TO DO IS TO TELL US EXACTLY WHAT THE FUTURE WILL BE TWO WEEKS, THREE WEEKS, A MONTH OUT. IT JUST CANNOT DO THAT.  YEAH. CORNELL BELCHER, ALWAYS A VOICE OF WISDOM ON ALL THIS, VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT. STILL TO COME, REPUBLICANS COMPLAIN ABOUT WHAT THEY REALLY MEAN WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT ALLOWING EXCEPTIONS FOR ABORTIONS. IT IS HORRIFYING. THE LATEST REPUBLICAN SUGGESTION FOR A COMMUNITY LEVEL REVIEW PROCESS AHEAD. 20221105002804.982|20221105003100.375",

        "trs": "AS A PHYSICIAN, I'VE BEEN IN THE ROOM WHEN THERE ARE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS HAPPENING. I DON'T WANT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INVOLVED WITH THAT AT ALL. I WANT WOMEN, DOCTORS, LOCAL POLITICAL LEADERS --  WOMEN, DOCTORS, LOCAL POLITICAL LEADERS. YOU ALL REMEMBER THAT MOMENT OF UNINTENTIONAL HONESTY FROM TV DR. MEHMET OZ, THE TRUMP BACKED CANDIDATE FOR U.S. SENATE IN PENNSYLVANIA DURING A DEBATE LAST WEEK. HIS ANSWER EXPOSE THE ABSURDITY OF THE POSITION OF THE MANY REPUBLICANS WHO SAY THAT THEY SUPPORT ABORTION BANS WITH EXCEPTIONS. YOU CAN HEAR THE SAME THING FROM ANOTHER TRUMP BACKED CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR CONGRESS IN NORTH CAROLINA. AFTER INTERVIEWING THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE, LOCAL TV STATION DESCRIBED HIS POSITION TO SWAY, QUOTE, HE WANTS VICTIMS OF RAPE AND INCEST TO BE ALLOWED TO GET AN ABORTION ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS THROUGH A COMMUNITY LEVEL REVIEW PROCESS. OKAY, SURELY, SOMETHING GOT LOST IN TRANSLATION, THAT CAN'T BE THIS GUY'S REAL POSITION, CAN IT?  I THINK WE HAVE TO USE LOOK AT EACH CASE INDIVIDUALLY.  AS YOU KNOW, LEGISLATION CAN'T BE WRITTEN ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, SO IF IT COMES BEFORE CONGRESS, LET'S SAY LINDSEY GRAHAM'S PROPOSAL IS TO HAVE EXCEPTIONS FOR RAPE, INCEST AND THE LIFE OF THE MOTHER. THE SUPPORT THAT?  I'D HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BILL, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU. I HAVE TO SEE HOW IT'S STRUCTURED. THERE'S CERTAIN LEGAL MECHANISMS HE COULD PUT IN A TO CREATE A INDIVIDUAL BASIS REVIEW. I REJECT THE NOTION THAT YOU COULD DO THE.  LEGISLATIVE MECHANISM FOR INDIVIDUAL BASIS REVIEW, COMMITTED A REVIEW TO DECIDE WHETHER A PREGNANT WOMEN OR GIRL MEETS THE CRITERIA OF RAPE OR INCEST. WHENEVER ONE OF THESE CANDIDATES PRICE FOR EVEN 30 SECONDS AND HOW THESE EXCEPTIONS WOULD WORK, THIS IS ALL TO COME UP WITH. THE FACT THIS, MOST RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS DID NOT EVEN REPORTED TO POLICE, SO ARE THEY GOING TO SUBMIT TO A COMMUNITY REVIEW PROCESS? I THINK ABOUT IT, AGAIN, THINK ABOUT IT FOR MORE THAN 30 SECONDS. IMAGINE A GIRL HAD TO GO TO TOWN HALL FOR A HEARING, STANDING AT A MICROPHONE TO EXPLAIN TO A PANEL OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS HOW SHE GOT PREGNANT FROM THIS INCEST? THIS IS THE REALITY. THIS IS WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE. THESE CALLS FOR EXCEPTIONS TO MAKE ABORTION BANS LESS INVASIVE THAN THEY REALLY ARE. SOME DEMOCRATS ARE COLLECTIVELY CONVEYING THAT MESSAGE, LIKE THE SAD FOR JOE CUNNINGHAM, RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR IN SOUTH CAROLINA.  WHEN I WAS 12 AND 1972, I WAS BABY SITTING FOR A NEIGHBORING FAMILY. THE FATHER CAME HOME WITH HIS FRIEND EARLIER FOR MARK, LOCKED THEIR CHILDREN OUTSIDE AND COMMENCED TO TAKE TURNS RAPING ME. I HAD TO HAVE AN ABORTION AT THE TIME WOULD KNOW ANASTASIA. I DID WHAT WAS BEST FOR AN 88 POUND, 12-YEAR-OLD WITH NO OTHER OPTIONS. I AM A SURVIVOR OF RAPE. MY BODY IS NOT YOURS, AND IT'S NOT THE STATES. IT'S MINE.  NOW IS THAT PREGNANT 12-YEAR-OLD RAPE VICTIM LIVED IN A -- DARKER WOULD HAVE TO SUBMIT TO A COMMUNITY REVIEW. AGAIN, IT'S NOT AN OBSTRUCTION, BECAUSE WITH ENOUGH REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS IN POWER, IT MAY VERY WELL SOON BE A REALITY. A REALITY 20221105004857.434|20221105005101.441",

        "trs": "> THERE'S TOO MUCH POLITICAL VIOLENCE. THERE'S TOO MUCH INTIMIDATION. THERE ARE MORE THAN 300 ELECTION DENIERS ON THE REPUBLICAN TICKETS THIS YEAR FOR STATE, FEDERAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. NO, NO, THIS IS REALLY SERIOUS STUFF. IF A REPUBLICAN NOMINEE IN CONGRESS -- FOR GOVERNOR IN THE STATE OF WISCONSIN WINS, HERE'S WHAT HE SAID. HE SAID, IF I WIN, MY PARTY WILL NEVER LOSE ANOTHER ELECTION IN WISCONSIN. HE'S EITHER A PROPHET OR HE PLANS ON DOING SOMETHING ABOUT ELECTION LAW.  HI, AGAIN, EVERYONE. IT IS CRUCIAL TO REMIND OURSELVES AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT WHEN IT COMES TO REPUBLICAN EFFORTS TO CALL INTO QUESTION THE LEGITIMACY OF ELECTIONS, FEAR ISN'T A BYPRODUCT. INTIMIDATION ISN'T A BUG, THEY'RE THE WHOLE POINT. THAT'S WHY THEY DO T. IF THEY CAN'T CHANGE THE RESULTS OF A PREVIOUS ELECTION, YOU CAN BET THE HOUSE THEY'LL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER, EVERYTHING TO CHANGE THE RESULTS OF THE NEXT ONE. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY SEEDS OF DOUBT PLANTED IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE 2020 ELECTION ARE STARTING TO BEAR FRUIT FROM THEM. FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL STANDPOINT WE'VE SEEN A SURGE IN LEGAL EFFORTS AIMED AT DISQUALIFYING THOUSANDS OF VOTERS ALONG WITH THE EMERGENCE OF ELECTION POLICE. THEY'RE ACTUALLY MAKING ARRESTS IN FLORIDA. THE LATEST EXAMPLE TODAY IN SAN LEWIS, ARIZONA, THE MAKING OF 2 THOUSAND MULES WHICH HAVE TO DO WITH DROP BOXES AND CELL PHONE DATA. INVESTIGATORS AND PROSECUTORS ARE INTIMIDATING VOTERS CHARGING FOUR PEOPLE WITH ILLEGALLY COLLECTING BALLOTS FROM \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\" REPORTING ON THIS, QUOTE, MANY HEARSAY THEY ARE AFRAID TO CAST BALLOTS OR HELP WITH VOTING IN THE MID-TERMS FOR FEAR OF RECEIVING A VISIT FROM INVESTIGATORS OR RUNNING AFOUL OF A NEW ARIZONA BALLOT ABUSE LAW. SADLY THAT INSTITUTIONALIZED SCARING IS CALLED ELECTION VIGILANTES. PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT TAKING MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS. AS THEY SEE IT, WHY WAIT FOR A STATE TO PURGE VOTERS WHEN INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS CAN FILE MASS CHALLENGES TO KICK VOTERS OFF THE ROLLS ON THEIR OWN. WHY ASK POLICE TO MONITOR DROP BOXES AND SITES WHEN ARMED ACTIVISTS CAN DON TACTICAL GEAR AND DO IT THEMSELVES. THERE ARE REASONS FOR LOWER VOTING. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT VOTER INTIMIDATION IS AMONG THEM? THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS VITAL FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY AND IT IS WHERE WE BEGIN THE HOUR. JOINING US NOW, MARK ELIAS. MARK, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU. I WANT TO GO THROUGH YOUR PIECE. TELL ME WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND HERE FOUR DAYS AHEAD OF WHAT IS REALLY AN EXTRAORDINARY ELECTION.  SO, THANKS FOR HAVING ME. YOU KNOW, THE THING THAT STRIKES ME MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE RIGHT NOW IS HOW MUCH WE ARE SEEING REPUBLICANS USE EVERY TOOL AT THEIR DISPOSAL TO UNDERMINE DEMOCRACY IN FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IN 2020, WE STARTED WITH THE PRESIDENT BAD MOUTHING VOTING AND UNDERMINING CONFIDENCE IN VOTING AND THAT STARTED IN THE SPRING AND WENT UP THROUGH ELECTION DAY. THEN WE SAW THE ABUSE OF THE COURTS AND FINALLY WE SAW VIOLENCE ON JANUARY 6th. WHAT HAVE WE SEEN SO FAR SINCE THEN? WELL, WE HAVE SEEN LEGISLATURES AND REPUBLICANS SPEAK OUT IN WAYS THAT UNDERMINE CONFIDENCE IN ELECTIONS. WE HAVE SEEN NOW THE USE OF THE COURTS ACCORDING TO DEMOCRACY DOCKET THAT TRACKS THIS. IN 2020 WE HAVE SEEN 170 INDIVIDUAL LAWSUITS IN 35 STATES, 103 OF THEM ARE ACTIVE AND THERE ARE 44 OF THOSE 103 THAT ARE BY ANTI-VOTING ACTIVISTS. NOW WE'RE STARTING TO SEE THE VIGIL ANTTIISM THAT MAY LEAD TO VIOLENCE. WE'RE SEEING THE POLITICAL PLAYBOOK ACCELERATE.  I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU CALL IT A PLAYBOOK. LET ME SEE IF I'VE CAPTURED EVERYTHING. SO ELECTIONS BY REPUBLICANS IN AMERICA ARE NOT HONORED. THE RESULTS, THEY'VE ALREADY SAID SOME OF THEM, THEY WON'T ACCEPT THEM. THE PEACEFUL TRANSFER OF POWER ENDED. I MEAN, IT ENDED ON JANUARY 6th OF LAST YEAR. THE RESULTS OF SOME OF THESE ELECTIONS ARE BEING CHALLENGED IN LAWSUITS BEFORE THE BALLOT COUNTING HAS BEGUN AND POLITICAL VIOLENCE IS NOW IMPLICITLY AND EXPLICITLY ACCEPTED BY THE RIGHT. WHAT IS THE BEST CASE SCENARIO ON TUESDAY?  I THINK THE BEST CASE SCENARIO ON TUESDAY IS THAT WE HAVE PEACE, WE HAVE PEOPLE VOTING AND THEN LIKELY WE ARE DEALING WITH ELECTION DENIERS AND BIG LIE ADVOCATES FOR THE WEEKS FOLLOWING. I THINK THAT'S HONESTLY THE BEST CASE. THE OTHER THING THAT'S DIFFERENT BETWEEN NOW AND 2020 IS AFTER 2020 DONALD TRUMP WAS SURROUNDED BY DISGRACED LAWYERS THAT PEOPLE MADE A MOCKERY OF, BUT IF YOU'RE BLAKE MASTERS IN ARIZONA OR YOU'RE HERSCHEL WALKER IN GEORGIA OR YOU'RE A FRINGE CANDIDATE RUNNING FOR HOUSE, IT'S MITCH McCONNELL AND KEVIN McCARTHY THAT ARE BEHIND IT. WHERE ARE THEY? THEY WERE ABLE TO STAY QUIET IN 2020 AND SORT OF ISOLATE, BUT THEY'RE EMBRACING THESE. THEY ARE EMBRACING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING AS ELECTION DENIERS. WHAT I HEAR IN THE AFTERMATH OF 2022, EVEN IN THE BEST CASE SCENARIO WHERE WE HAVE PEACE AND WE HAVE VOTING, IS WILL KEVIN McCARTHY DENOUNCE THE CANDIDATES WHO DENY THE OUTCOME OF THE ELECTION? WILL MITCH McCONNELL TELL A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE HE CAN SEE RATHER THAN PERPETUATING FALSE NARRATIVES? I DOUBT IT.  MITCH McCONNELL SPECIFICALLY, I'VE MENTIONED IT A FEW TIMES, IT WAS SO STRIKING TO ME. WHEN I ASKED JONATHAN GREEN BLAT, HEAD OF THE ADL, WHY HE WOULDN'T CONDEMN ANTI-SEMITISM FROM DONALD TRUMP OR ANYBODY ELSE ON THE RIGHT, HE WOULDN'T TELL ME WHAT THEIR PRIVATE CONVERSATION INCLUDED AND HE SAID, LISTEN, MITCH McCONNELL WON'T DEFEND HIS WIFE. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU THE SAME ANSWER HE GAVE ME. DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH. I WANT TO GO THROUGH WHAT FEELS LIKE AN ACCELERATION, AGAIN, INSTITUTIONALIZED ACCELERATION FROM 2020 WHERE TRUMP WAS HAPHAZARD AND CHAOTIC AND ADVISED BY THIS RAG TAG GROUP OF THE PILLOW GUY AND THE OVERSTOCK GUY AND EVERYONE HE GAVE PARDONS TO IN THE FINAL WEEKS, BANNON, FLYNN AND THE OTHER GUY, BANNON. NOW HE'S GOT THIS ARMY OF ELECTED OFFICIALS AND VIGILANTES THAT YOU WRITE ABOUT TODAY AND JUST THE ACT OF STAKING OUT A BALLOT BOX, FILMING IT. I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY ALL HAVE TACTICAL GEAR IN THEIR CLOSETS, BUT THEY DO, AND WEARING IT TO THE BALLOT BOX. ARE YOU WORRIED? DO YOU THINK WHEN WE LOOK BACK THAT PEOPLE WILL HAVE FELT FEARFUL TO VOTE?  SURE. I MEAN, I HOPE THEY DON'T AND I HOPE EVERYONE VOTES. I HOPE PEOPLE OVERCOME THAT, BUT ARE PEOPLE FEARFUL WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE IN TACTICAL GEAR? BY THE WAY, AIRING WEAPONS? YEAH. ARE PEOPLE FEARFUL WHEN THEY ARE EXPERIENCING EVERY DAY PEOPLE LYING ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF 2020 AND MAKING MOVIES THAT VILIFY PEOPLE AND THEY READ ABOUT THE THREATS THOSE PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING? SURE. WHEN YOU WATCH THE JANUARY 6th HEARING YOU SAW PEOPLE DESCRIBE THE FEARFULNESS THAT THEY EXPERIENCED, THE HARASSMENT THEY EXPERIENCED. YEAH, I TO WORRY ABOUT THAT. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY PART OF THEIR PLAN. WE CAN'T LET THAT WIN, BUT WE ALSO CAN'T IGNORE IT'S GOING ON.  RIGHT.  YOU CAN'T SIMPLY ALLOW THIS VIGILANTEISM GOING ON AND NOT SAY ANYTHING. WHEN THE VIGILANTES MARCHED IN CHARLOTTESVILLE, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, AT LEAST SOME OF IT, STOOD UP AGAINST IT. WHERE IS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STANDING UP AGAINST THE VIGILANTEISM WE'RE SEEING?  AND I GUESS A LACK OF STANDING UP MEANS COMPLICITY, ACCEPTANCE, ENTHUSIASM? HOW DO YOU SEE IT?  OH, I THINK COMPLICITY IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT. I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE SEEN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NOT JUST TOLERATE VIGILANTEISM, YOU SEE THEM EMBRACE IT. THERE IS A REASON WHY STEVE BANNON IS THE LEADER OF THE DE FACTO PARTY BECAUSE SHE'S NOT STANDING UP. THE RNC IS NOT DENOUNCING WHAT THE PILLOW SALESMEN ARE SAYING, WHAT THE STEVE BANNONS ARE SAYING, WHAT THE KARI LAKES ARE SAYING. IT'S MORE THAN COMPLICITY. THEY ARE PART OF IT.  MARK, I KNOW THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND WEEKS ARE GOING TO BE BUSY. IF WE COULD PUT YOU ON THE SPOT TO TALK TO US MONDAY OR TUESDAY ON LIVE TV, I WOULD LOVE THAT.  I WOULD LOVE THAT. ANY TIME YOU'LL HAVE ME, I'LL BE THERE.  SAME TIME MONDAY WE'D LOVE TO TALK TO YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. > LET'S BRING IN MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE MSNBC'S NEW -- WHAT IS YOUR TITLE? ANCHOR AND CONTRIBUTOR, JEN PSAKI.  NOT QUITE YET. ALMOST.  FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY. SHE'S BEEN OUT TALKING TO VOTERS, WAY OUT FROM BEHIND THE PODIUM GETTING THEIR REACTION. I'M GOING TO SHOW WHAT YOU -- YOU'RE REPORTING. I WANT TO FIRST ASK YOU, YOU KNOW, I WORKED IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE HAD BRUTAL FIGHTS. HALF THE COUNTRY DISLIKED MY BOSS. I MEAN, YOU WERE BEHIND THE PODIUM DOING VERBAL COMBAT EVERY DAY. DID YOU EVER THINK YOU WOULD BE COVERING A LAUNDRY LIST OF THINGS IN OUR COUNTRY THAT WERE ANTIDEMOCRATIC?  NO. MAYBE THAT WAS NAIVE. I BET YOU DIDN'T EITHER. AND I THINK WHAT'S DIFFERENT NOW AND WHAT FEELS DIFFERENT NOW, I'VE BEEN TALKING TO MY FORMER FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES ABOUT THIS, TOO, YOU'RE NOT JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO PREPARE FOR A DEBATE ABOUT THE DEBT LIMIT OR SOCIAL SECURITY, YOU'RE PREPARING FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THERE'S THREE -- MORE THAN 300 CANDIDATES WHO ARE ELECTION DENIERS ON THE BALLOT. THERE IS MOW LIT CALL VIOLENCE THAT IS BEING PROMOTED AS MARK ELIAS SAID, IGNORED, PEOPLE ARE COMPLICIT IN IT ON THE OTHER SIDE AND THERE ARE CHALLENGES THAT FEEL QUITE DIFFERENT THAN THE QUAINTNESS OF WHAT WAS GOING TO BE IN AN OMNIBUS BILL THAT I WAS DEALING WITH TEN YEARS AGO.  WE'RE SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU AND TO HAVE YOU ON THESE BIG NIGHTS AND THESE BIG WEEKS. I WANT TO SHOW SOME OF THE REPORTING AND SOME OF YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH VOTERS. LET ME PUT THIS ONE UP FIRST. THIS IS ANDY NEWBURG.  SO WHAT ARE THE ISSUES THAT MAKE YOUR BLOOD BOIL ON THE OTHER SIDE?  THE WHOLE IDEA OF ELECTION FRAUD. JUST BURNS ME UP. HYPOCRISY JUST BURNS ME UP. I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT I CAN SEE PEOPLE LYING SO OPENLY AND WITH CONFIDENCE AND IT JUST -- IT'S -- IT'S TERRIFYING AND IT'S ALSO DISGUSTING. JUST -- IT'S -- IT REALLY DOES TURN MY STOMACH TO SEE PEOPLE JUST ACCUSING AND JUST SO SURE, REVVING THEM UP IN CERTAIN WAYS. IT'S A BUNCH OF PITCH FORKS AND TORCHES GOING AFTER WHATEVER WILL GET THEM THIS MUCH SPACE AND IT'S ALL A BIG POWER GAME AND IT'S DEPRESSING.  I GUESS I HAD NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE, BUT THIS MIGHT BE A DEMOCRACY VOTER, RIGHT? SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE THE FACT THAT THE SIDE THAT LOSES DOESN'T ACCEPT THE RESULTS. TELL ME IF YOU SAW A LOT OF THAT AND WHAT HE PLANS TO DO NEXT WEEK.  I DID. , LORIO IS RUNNING POWERFUL PRO DEMOCRACY AD AND IT HASN'T BEEN SOMETHING THEY WERE RUNNING ON. AS I WAS WALKING AROUND WESTCHESTER COUNTY, THIS ISSUE CAME UP. PEOPLE WERE SCARED OF ELECTION DENIERS, THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT DISINFORMATION. NOW THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THIS DISTRICT I THINK ARE IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE IT IS AN UPPER MIDDLE CLASS AREA. IT'S PREDOMINANTLY WHITE. A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID THEY KNOW THERE ARE CONCERNS -- THERE ARE ISSUES IN THE ECONOMY BUT IT'S NOT AS IMPORTANT AS THE PROTECTION OF OUR DEMOCRACY. THAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME. IT ALSO LEFT ME THINKING, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS THAT WE NEED TO -- THAT DEMOCRATS NEED TO CLOSE WITH VOTERS. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS NOT MONOLITHIC. IT'S NOT A PARTY OF ONE DEMOGRAPHIC OR ONE ISSUE, BUT IT WAS AN ISSUE THAT CAME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AS I WAS FOLLOWING CANVASSERS EARLIER THIS WEEK.  I WANT TO SHOW ANOTHER CLIP OF YOU TALKING TO A VOTER. I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID. HOW SHOULD DEMOCRATS BE CLOSING WITH VOTERS?  I THINK THE KEY THING, NICOLE, TO REMEMBER THAT SOME DISTRICTS -- DISTRICTS ARE DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER. WHILE THERE ARE PLACES WHERE CERTAINLY MAKING THE CASE AS TO WHY THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A BETTER PLAN TO ADDRESS INFLATION, PROTECT SOCIAL SECURITY IS EXACTLY THE RIGHT ONE, AND THERE ARE PLACES WHERE ABORTION AND PROTECTING ABORTION RIGHTS IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO WORK. CERTAINLY IT WOULD IN THIS DISTRICT. THIS IS A DISTRICT WHERE IT'S PIVOTAL SEAN PATRICK MALONEY COME BACK TO CONGRESS. THIS IS A DEMOCRATIC LEANING DISTRICT. PEOPLE THERE WERE MOTIVATED AND EXCITED TIME AND TIME AGAIN AS WE TALK TO THEM ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE. I MEAN, CONCERNED BY IT. EXCITED BECAUSE THEY WERE CONCERNED BY IT. I THINK WHAT I LEARNED OR MY TAKE AWAY FROM THIS DAY WAS THAT DEMOCRATS REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT ISSUES ARE GOING TO LIGHT THE FIRE IN DIFFERENT DISTRICTS. CANDIDATES ARE DOING THAT BUT IT'S NOT A CHOICE BETWEEN ONE ISSUE OR ANOTHER.  LET ME PLAY YOUR CONVERSATION WITH EILEEN DAVIS, ANOTHER VOTER.  WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN THAT CONCERNS YOU ABOUT WHAT MAY HAPPEN IN THE ELECTION?  WELL, THE WHOLE ELECTION DENIER THING IS A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE I AM ALSO AN ELECTION DENIER FROM WHAT HAPPENED TO AL GORE BUT WE HAVE TO AGREE, TAKE YOUR LOSS, TAKE IT ON THE CHIN, THAT'S HOW WE'RE ALL GOING TO -- THESE LAWS ARE NOT MADE BY GOD. WE ALL HAVE A SOCIAL AGREEMENT TO KEEP THE PEACE SO TOOK OUR LOSS AND NOW TAKE YOURS.  I LOVE THIS. OBVIOUSLY I WORKED FOR GEORGE W. BUSH BUT I HAD PLAYED AL GORE'S CONCESSION. IT IS SORT OF THE LONGER LENS OF HISTORY, IT MADE THE DIFFERENCE REALLY BETWEEN PEACE AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW AFTER 2020.  TRUE. AND IT ALSO WAS SO EYE OPENING FOR ME SPEAKING WITH EILEEN. SHE GREW UP IN BROOKLYN. SHE'S NOT PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT CRIME. SHE SAID, YOU KNOW, SHE'S VERY WORRIED ABOUT ABORTION RIGHTS. SHE'S LIVED IN THIS HOUSE FOR DECADES, I BELIEVE, AND SHE ALSO KIND OF SHARED A MESSAGE THAT WAS -- I CAME AWAY A LITTLE CONCERNED FOR DEMOCRATS MOVING FORWARD AND THIS ARGUMENT ABOUT THE IMPACT OF ELECTION DENIERS BECAUSE SHE WAS BASICALLY SAYING, I DIDN'T LIKE THE OUTCOME IN 2000 AND I THOUGHT AL GORE SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRESIDENT AND IT WASN'T FAIR AND THEREFORE I'M AN ELECTION DENIER TOO. THEY TEND TO MUDDY THE WATERS. WE CARE ABOUT DEMOCRACY, TOO, JUST LIKE THEY DO. OR ON POLITICAL VIOLENCE. THERE'S VIOLENCE ON ALL SIDES. THIS IS NOT AN ALL SIDES ISSUE. THE ELECTION DENIERS RUNNING ARE RUNNING ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE. I THOUGHT, OH, MY GOODNESS, THAT IS A MESSAGING CHALLENGE AND WILL BE MOVING FORWARD FOR DEMOCRATS.  JEN PSAKI, WE'RE SO HAPPY TO HAVE YOU AT OUR TABLE IN THE COMING DAYS. I LOOK FORWARD TO SPENDING LOTS OF TIME WITH YOU.  YOU TOO. MANY HOURS. MANY CUPS OF COFFEE TOGETHER, NICOLE.  YOU'LL SEE, RACHEL WARNED YOU. MY SNACKS ARE ALL PELLET SIZE.  PERFECT. I'LL BRING SOME TOO.  WHEN WE COME BACK, A HIGH STAKES GAME OF CHICKEN BETWEEN ATTORNEY GENERAL MERRICK GARLAND AND THE TWICE IMPEACHED EX-PRESIDENT. BRAND-NEW REPORTING SAYS THAT THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT IS CONSIDERING APPOINTING A SPECIAL COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE THE EX-PRESIDENT IF HE PLANS TO RUN AGAIN.

NBC NEWS HAS NOT CONFIRMED THE ELECTION WORKER'S PARTY AFFILIATION BUT SENATOR RON JOHNSON LOCKED IN A CLOSE REELECTION FIGHT IS USING IT AS AN EXAMPLE OF POTENTIAL ELECTION FRAUD.  DO YOU COMMIT TO ACCEPTING THE RESULTS OF TUESDAY'S ELECTION?  I SURE HOPE I CAN BUT I CAN'T PREDICT WHAT THE DEMOCRATS MIGHT HAVE PLANNED.  IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU SEE?  IT HAS TO.

HERE WITH US NOW SENATE CANDIDATE AND WISCONSIN LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR DEMOCRAT MANDELLA BARNES RUNNING AGAINST THE INCUMBENT RON JOHNSON. ARE YOU TAKING THAT TO MEAN THAT SENATOR JOHNSON IS SEIZING ON THIS INCIDENT, THIS ALLEGED INCIDENT, TO SAY THAT HE'S NOT GOING TO ACCEPT THE RESULTS, THE OUTCOME?  WELL, SENATOR JOHNSON HAS SHOWN WHO HE IS TIME AND TIME AGAIN. REMEMBER THIS IS A PERSON WHO TRIED TO SEND FRAUDULENT ELECTORS TO THE VICE PRESIDENT IN AN ATTEMPT TO OVERTURN A FREE AND FAIR ELECTION BECAUSE HE DIDN'T GET THE RESULT THAT HE WANTED.

I'M EXCITED TO SEE THE CLOUDS THAT CONTINUE TO BUILD BECAUSE FOLKS ARE READY FOR CHANGE AND WE ARE READY TO STAND ALONG THEM TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.  HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM IS THE HEADWINDS THE PRESIDENT'S LACK OF POPULARITY, HE IS UNDER WATER, THE PARTY, PEOPLE WANT CHANGE AND YOU ARE THE INCUMBENT PARTY SO HISTORICALLY MIDTERMS ARE TOUGH.  THIS IS ABOUT WISCONSIN IT'S NOT ABOUT ANYBODY IN WASHINGTON AND IT'S ALSO NOT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, PARTY LABELS OR AFFILIATION OR IDEOLOGY. WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE IN WISCONSIN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AREN'T ALWAYS LEFT OR RIGHT, RED OR BLUE, IT'S ABOUT HOW WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND IT'S ABOUT THE FOLKS THAT RON JOHNSON HAS KEPT AT THE TOP AND EVERYBODY ELSE HE HAS LEFT BEHIND FOR 12 YEARS. THE REALITY IS WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A MULTIMILLIONAIRE WHO WAS SO OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE OF WISCONSIN A PERSON WHO IS SUCCESSFUL, MULTIMILLION DOLLAR BUSINESS HAS PAID ZERO DOLLARS IN STATE INCOME TAXES SINCE 2013. A PERSON WHO HAS WRITTEN THE RULES FOR HIMSELF, THE RULES THAT MAKE THE WEALTHY EVEN MORE WEALTHY WHILE LEAVING WORKING CLASS PEOPLE BEHIND. HIS MULTIMILLION DOLLAR REAL ESTATE EMPIRE BENEFITTED FROM THE TAX BILL THAT HE SUPPORTED AND THAT'S HOW THE DECK CONTINUES TO BE STACKED AGAINST WORKING PEOPLE. WE NEED FOLKS WHO WILL FIGHT FOR WORKING CLASS PEOPLE, FIGHT FOR GOOD PAYING JOBS IN A COMMUNITY, NO AT PERSON WHO WILL FIGHT FOR HIMSELF. MANDELABARNES.COM BECAUSE WE NEED YOUR HELP TO GET THIS DONE.  WISCONSIN LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR MANDELA BARNES THANKS VERY MUCH. > ONE OF THE MOST VULNERABLE DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE IS IN THE POLITICAL FIGHT FOR HER LIFE. INCUMBENT SENATOR KATHERINE CORTEZ MASTRO DEFENDING HER SEAT AGAINST ADAM LAXALT. GAS PRICES, UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE STATE AMONG THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION. JOINING ME NOW IS THE OTHER DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM NEVADA, JACKY ROSEN. SENATOR, HOW STUFF IS IT TO WIN REELECTION FOR A DEMOCRAT IN THIS ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN NEVADA?  WELL, I THINK THAT FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE LAST DAY OF EARLY VOTE. I WANT TO GET THAT OUT THERE RIGHT AWAY. YOU CAN EARLY VOTE TODAY, THROUGH TODAY REGISTER TODAY AND VOTE, YOU CAN MAIL IN OR DROP OFF YOUR BALLOT AND WE HAVE SAME DAY REGISTRATION, YOU CAN DO THAT AS WELL ON TUESDAY. LET ME TALK ABOUT THE STATE OF THE RACE IN NEVADA. PEOPLE KNOW SENATOR CORTEZ MASTRO, SHE WAS A TWO TERM ATTORNEY GENERAL, THE STATE'S TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICE. SHE IS A PROBLEM-SOLVER BUT WE ARE IN A PURPLE CASE SO RACES ARE ALWAYS TIGHT HERE. WE'RE A BATTLEGROUND STATE, WE KNOW WHAT WE HAVE TO DO, WE'RE TURNING OUT THE VOTE, KATHERINE IS REALLY KNOWN WELL AROUND THE STATE AND I THINK THAT SHE'S GOING TO COME OUT VICTORIOUS.  YOU'VE GOT OF COURSE THE CASINO WORKERS, YOU'VE GOT A VERY LARGE LATINO VOTE, HARRY REID IS NOT THERE, SADLY HE'S PASSED, BUT HARRY REID USED TO ALWAYS PULL DEMOCRATS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE IN NEVADA. WHAT DO YOU SEE OUT THERE NOW IN THE EARLY VOTE SO FAR?  WELL, I CAN TELL YOU OUR CULINARY UNION HAS TALKED TO US ABOUT KNOCKING ON ABOUT A MILLION DOORS. WE HAVE STRONG COORDINATED CAMPAIGN WHERE WE ARE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE ABOUT ELECTING AND REELECTING DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE TICKET BY KATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO AND STEVE SISOLAK. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE SUBMITTED A SLATE OF ELECTION DENIERS, ADAM LAXALT, THE FACE OF DONALD TRUMP'S BIG DIE LAO I IN NEVADA, SUBMITTING LAWSUIT AFTER LAWSUIT TO OVERTURN THE LAST ELECTION. HE'S ALREADY INDICATED THAT HE'S INTERESTED IN PARTICULARLY BANNING -- RESTRICTING A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE IN NEVADA WHICH IS AGAINST THE WILL OF NEVADA VOTERS. WE HAVE THAT IN OUR STATE LAW. HE SAID HE WANTS TO JAIL WOMEN POSSIBLY THEIR PHYSICIANS FOR SEEKING REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE. SO OUR SLATE -- OUR SLATE IS A CLEAR CHOICE, WE'VE DELIVERED FOR PEOPLE, WE'VE WORKED TO HELP FAMILIES GROW AND THRIVE AND THE SLATE OF EXTREMISTS ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE THEY DON'T HAVE A PLAN EXCEPT TO ATTACK YOUR VOTING RIGHTS, REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, WE CAN GO DOWN THE LIST. THEY EVEN WANT TO DECERTIFY THE 2020 ELECTION.  SENATOR JACKY ROSEN, THANKS FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. I APPRECIATE IT.  THANK YOU. > AND LET'S BRING IN REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST SUSAN DELL PEZIO AND PATRICK GASPART. WELCOME ALL. CYRUS, IN TERMS OF EARLY VOTING THE YOUTH VOTE YOU STUDY HAS DROPPED DRAMATICALLY SO FAR IN EARLY VOTING FROM TWO YEARS AGO. ACCORDING TO \"POLITICO,\" THEIR ANALYSIS. SO FAR TARGET SMART SAYS THAT THE YOUTH VOTE IS IN SINGLE DIGITS IN A NUMBER OF STATES. WHAT DO YOU SEE THE MOTIVATION -- WHAT DO YOU SEE IN TERMS OF YOUR -- YOUR SURVEYS SHOW THAT THEY HAVE -- ABOUT 34% SAY THEY INTEND TO VOTE.  EXACTLY. I WOULD SAY TWO THINGS THAT CAN BE TRUE AT THE SAME TIME, ONE, I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE RECORD BUSTING RATES OF YOUNG PEOPLE OUT TO VOTE ON TUESDAY. THE SECOND THING I WANT TO SAY I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE VOTING ON TUESDAY COMPARED TO LARGER OLDER AGE BLOCKS AND I THINK THAT THAT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THE STATE OF THE YOUTH VOTE. WE'RE SEEING INCREMENTAL PROGRESS, WE SAW ABOUT 16% OR SO IN 2014, 35% IN 2018. WE MIGHT SEE A RECORD BREAKER IN THIS CASE, BUT WE ARE STILL TALKING ABOUT WAY TOO FEW YOUNG PEOPLE VOTING TO BE COMFORTABLE AS A SOCIETY, AS A DEMOCRACY.  HOW DO YOU GET YOUNG PEOPLE MORE INTERESTED IN VOTING? IS IT THE QUALITY OF THE CANDIDATES, THE ISSUES, JUST NOT CARING ABOUT IT?  YEAH. THE TWO THINGS THAT I ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY, ONE IS YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE ISSUES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE CARE ABOUT. YOUNG PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THE ISSUES THAT MOST OTHER AGE BRACKETS CARE ABOUT. YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE MESSAGING, CHANGE THE WAY THAT YOU'RE DELIVERING THAT MESSAGE NOT NECESSARILY THE CONCEPT BUT THE PACKAGING, THAT'S ONE THING. AND I WILL LEAVE IT THERE.  SUSAN, BOTH PARTIES WANT THE YOUTH VOTE, THE DEMOCRATS IN PARTICULAR REALLY ARE HUNGRY FOR YOUTH VOTE TO GET SOME OF THESE TIGHT RACES ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. HOW DO THEY REACH THEM?  I THINK THAT HE TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING INTERESTING IN HOW YOU TALK TO THEM, WHAT METHODS DO YOU TALK TO THEM? YOU CAN'T PUT IN A TELEVISION AD THAT ONLY RUNS ON CABLE NEWS, IT'S GOT TO SHOW UP ON THEIR PHONES OR THEIR COMPUTERS OR OTHERWISE THE MESSAGE IS NOT REACHING THEM BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT MESSAGING IS IMPORTANT AND THE ISSUES ARE SHARED ISSUES, BUT I CAN ALSO TELL YOU AS AN OPERATIVE IF YOU ARE RELYING ON THE YOUTH VOTE RIGHT NOW, YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A CHANCE. YOU NEED TO GET EVERYTHING ELSE OUT THERE THAT HAS A PROVEN RECORD OF SHOWING UP.  WHAT ABOUT TIKTOK, CYRUS? IS THAT ONE WAY TO GET TO YOUNG PEOPLE?  THAT'S AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY. YOU HAVE TO GO TO WHERE THEY ARE. THEY ARE ON TIKTOK, ABSOLUTELY, BUT DON'T GET ON TIKTOK AND TALK ABOUT ISSUES THAT YOU ASSUME YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CARE ABOUT. DON'T TALK ABOUT THE ROCK AND ROLL EIGHT TRACKS, GO TALK ABOUT INCOME INEQUALITY, TALK ABOUT INFLATION AND CRIME, JUST DO IT IN A PLACE THAT THEY ARE GOING TO LISTEN TO YOU.  SUSAN, WHAT ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS AND, YOU KNOW, THE -- SUSAN, I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU ALSO ABOUT THE DEMOCRATS BEFORE I BRING IN PATRICK. WHAT DO YOU SEE AS A REPUBLICAN OPERATIVE IN TERMS OF WHAT DEMOCRATS, YOU KNOW, ARE FAILING TO DO SO FAR?  I THINK THAT THEY ARE FAILING TO SPEAK WITH ANY DEMOGRAPHIC, WHETHER IT'S THE YOUTH VOTE OR ANYWHERE ALONG THE LINE. INSTEAD THEY ARE TALKING AT THEM. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO BE RELATABLE THEY'RE TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED -- THEY THINK THEY NEED TO KNOW, BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEIR DOLLAR IS NOT GOING AS FAR AS IT USED TO. PEOPLE KNOW THAT WHEN THEY GO TO THE GAS PUMP THEY'RE PAYING FOR. PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE. DON'T TELL THEM THEY SHOULDN'T FEEL SAFE BECAUSE OF CRIME STATISTICS. IF THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE GOING ON THE SUBWAY, FOR EXAMPLE. SO I THINK DEMOCRATS HAVE A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT JOB TO SPEAK WITH PEOPLE THAN AT THEM.  SO, PATRICK, WHAT NOW DO THE DEMOCRATS HAVE TO DO? YOU HAVE FOUR DAYS LEFT. ARGUABLY, YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THE ABORTION ISSUE, THE DOBBS ISSUE, WAS SO ENERGIZING BUT IT WAS BACK IN JUNE AND JULY AND THAT, YOU KNOW, DEMOCRATS SPENT A LOT OF MONETIZING ON IT AND MESSAGING ON IT, BUT DIDN'T CATCH UP TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE ECONOMY AS GAS PRICES WENT BACK UP.  THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON, ANDREA. THANK YOU FOR THAT FANTASTIC QUESTION. I KNOW THAT JUNE AND JULY MAY SEEM LIKE EONS IN THE MEDIA ECOSYSTEM WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW BUT FOR AVERAGE FOLK IT WAS JUST YESTERDAY AND THEY ARE STILL FEELING THE IMPACT OF THE DOBBS DECISION IN THEIR LIVES, PARTICULARLY IN DISTRICTS THAT ARE BEING OVERWHELMED BY WOMEN WHO HAVE TO COME FROM SOME OF THESE RUBY RED DEEP DISTRICTS IN ORDER TO GET REPRODUCTIVE SERVICES. I WANT TO SAY THAT THERE. CYRUS AND SUSAN SAID A LOT OF REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT YOUTH TURNOUT BUT I WILL REMIND ALL OF US THAT WE'RE SEEING HISTORIC -- ALREADY HISTORIC LEVELS OF EARLY PARTICIPATION IN EARLY VOTE, CLOSE TO 30 MILLION AMERICANS HAVING PARTICIPATED ALREADY, THERE IS A LOT OF INTEREST, A LOT OF ENERGY IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND AS A CONSEQUENCE WE ARE SEEING DEMOCRATS RUNNING DEAD EVEN IN KEY SENATE STATES AND DOING BETTER THAN EXPECTED IN GOVERNORSHIPS AND ARE AT HIGHLY COMPETITIVE IN CONGRESSIONAL RACES AS WELL. SO RIGHT NOW DEMOCRATS HAVE TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE A HARD CONTRAST BETWEEN WHAT THEY'VE ACHIEVED, WHAT REPUBLICANS HAVE SAID THEY'RE GOING TO DO IN THE NEXT CONGRESS AND WHAT DEMOCRATS INTEND TO DO TO KEEP PUSHING PRICES DOWN TO ADDRESS THE CRIME ISSUE, THEY HAVE TO REMIND AMERICANS THAT EIGHT OF THE TEN STATES WITH THE HIGHEST MURDER RATES ARE LED BY REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND MOST IS DRIVEN BY GUN, CRIME AND THE KIND OF LEGISLATION THAT REPUBLICANS ARE BLOCKING. THEY HAVE TO REMIND THEM WE ARE AT THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT WE HAVE HAD IN 50 YEARS AND THAT'S MOSTLY AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE LEGISLATION PASSED BY BIDEN, PELOSI, SCHUMER AND DEMOCRATS AND THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE ALREADY SAID THEY INTEND TO GO RIGHT AT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE SHOULD THEY BE IN THE MAJORITY. ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT CHOICES, CONTRAST, DEMOCRATS HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE THAT CASE IN THE CLOSING DAYS.  PATRICK, THANK YOU SO MUCH AND SUSAN AND CYRUS, THANKS TO BOTH OF YOU. > AND SOON FREE LUNCHES COULD BE PROVIDED FOR ALL STUDENTS IN COLORADO NOT JUST FOR THOSE IN NEED. THAT IS IF VOTERS APPROVE A MEASURE ON THE STATE BALLOT TUESDAY. BUT LIKE ALL THINGS SOMEONE IS GOING TO HAVE TO PAY. THE QUESTION NOW IS WHO IS GOING TO PAY. THE STATE IS REQUESTING THE WEALTHIEST RESIDENTS IN COLORADO TO FOOT THE BILL. DANA GRIFFIN HAS MORE FROM COLORADO.  TODAY WE ARE GOING OUT AND STALKING NEIGHBORS.  Reporter: IN JEFFERSON COUNTY, COLORADO THIS IS THE SOUND OF PERSISTENCE.  IT WOULD BE FREE FOOD FOREVER.  Reporter: SUPPORTERS OF PROPOSITION FF WANT TO MAKE IT UNIVERSAL. THEY GOT A TRIAL RUN DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN WAIVERS GET DISTRICTS FEED EVERY KID FOR TREE. SOME DISTRICTS SERVED THOUSANDS OF MEALS PER DAY PROOF THAT PRE-PANDEMIC NUTRITION PROGRAMS AND THE ONES IN PLACE NOW LEAVE TOO MANY EMPTY STOMACHS.  KIDS NEED FOOD TO LEARN.  Reporter: TO PAY FOR IT COLORADO WOULD CAP TAX DEDUCTIONS ON HIGH EARNERS, ANYONE MAKING MORE THAN $300,000 WOULD SEE THEIR TAX BILL RISE ON AVERAGE MORE THAN $800. CURRENTLY A FAMILY OF FOUR MAKING LESS THAN $51,000 A YEAR IS ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH BUT SUPPORTERS SAY 60,000 COLORADO KIDS ABOVE THE INCOME THRESHOLD CANNOT AFFORD LUNCH. SARA AND HER HUSBAND MICHAEL HAVE TWO BOYS, THE COUPLES INCOME IS JUST ABOVE THE CUTOFF.  IT'S A FRUSTRATING THING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT I HAVE TROUBLE PAYING OUR BILLS EVERY MONTH AND TO SAY THAT WE MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY.  Reporter: EDUCATORS SAY SOME WHO RECEIVE FREE OR REDUCED MEALS TRY TO AVOID THE STIGMA OF BEING THE POOR KID BY JUST NOT EATING.  I STILL REMEMBER THE SHAME THAT I FELT EVERY TIME I GOT MY LUNCH.  Reporter: TEACHERS SAY HUNGRY KIDS TEND TO FOCUS LESS AND HAVE MORE BEHAVIOR ISSUES BUT IN A STATE WITH MORE THAN 3.7 MILLION TAXPAYERS SHOULD JUST MORE THAN 100,000 OF THEM FOOD THIS BILL.  IT SOUNDS WARM AND FUZZY BUT IT'S A TERRIBLE BILL.  Reporter: JOHN RECOMMENDS A NO VOTE.  WHAT WE ARE DOING IS WE ARE TAXING THE TOP 5% TO BUY LAUNCHES FOR ALL THE UPPER MIDDLE CLASS AND WEALTHY KIDS BEYOND THE POOR KIDS. IT'S A VERY PERVERSE SYSTEM.  Reporter: SOME CRITICS SUGGEST THE STATE SHOULD EXPAND ELIGIBILITY FOR FREE AND REDUCED LUNCH BY 5 TO 10% FEEDING A NEED WITHOUT TAXING JUST TOP EARNERS. > AND THAT WAS NBC'S DANA GRIFFIN REPORTING. NATIONALLY POLLS FIND SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HALF AND THREE QUARTERS OF AMERICANS SUPPORT THE IDEA OF FREE SCHOOL MEALS. > NEW DETAILS WHAT THE POLICE DID NOT KNOW WHEN THEY RESPONDED TO THAT CALL FOR HELP FROM THE PELOSI HOUSE IN SAN FRANCISCO.
