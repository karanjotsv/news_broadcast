       " 'trs': \"WELCOME TO A SPECIAL EDITION OF -- LOOKING BACK IN 25 NEWS MAKERS AND POLITICS, BUSINESS, POP ULTRA, ENTERTAINMENT, AND SPORTS. AND WHETHER THEY WERE UP OR DOWN BY THE END OF THE YEAR. AND, DONNY GEORGE IS HERE TO TAKE US THROUGH THEM ALL. YIKES. A LOT OF BRANDS DOWNS. SOME GROUND. UPS  AND YOU KNOW, THE THING, IS SOME OF THESE ACTUALLY ARE A BIT OBVIOUS. BUT WHAT MAKES IT SO INTERESTING IS, WE'VE GOT JOHNNY. HERE HE'S GOT THAT SPECIAL SAUCE. HE OBVIOUSLY. AN ADVERTISING LEGEND. A BRANDING LEGEND. HE'S GOT THE BRANDING. A NO YOU'VE EVER BEEN OVER TO HIS PLACE. HE HAS THE SUPERCOMPUTER. THE BRANDING SUPERCOMPUTER. WE GO TO THIS GUY TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS UP, WHO IS, DOWN AND WHY.  THERE'S ABOUT 2017 YEARS SCIENTISTS WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK. OUT OF THE WAY THEY ARE, DANISH BUT THAT'S JUST. SOMEHOW THEY KIND OF GOT TOGETHER. AND THEY WORK WITH THE SUPERCOMPUTER. THEY USE A GOOGLE MACHINE, ALSO. THEY DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. GEORGE, SAID A LOT OF THESE. A LOT OF TIMES WE DO THIS ON A WEEKLY BASIS. I KIND OF DO FUNNY THINGS LIKE BILL BEAT MARTINIS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I TRIED TO JUST, WHEN WE LOOK AT A YEAR IN 25 OF THEM. WE CAN UPENDED TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF BASICALLY THE TWO-DAY STEWARDS OF MOURNING  A YEAR AND RAP WOULD BE NEGLIGENT NOT TO. DO IT  AND YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE HE'S GOT THE DOUBLE BREASTED BLAZER ON SO IT'S GAME. ON  IT IS GAME DAY. AND I WILL TELL, YOU IF THE CHOICE OF THE DOUBLE BREASTED BLAZER, THE DANISH SCIENTISTS IN THEIR LAP JACKETS, IN THEIR LAB COATS WERE THE ONES THAT TOLD HIM TO WEAR THAT. THAT IS ALL WE ARE GOING TO SAY ABOUT THE DANISH SCIENTISTS. WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE. I WANT TO START WITH DONALD TRUMP. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THAT IS OBVIOUS BUT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND I WILL TELL YOU. WHY THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH A REMARKABLE SIX YEARS. AN EXTRAORDINARY SIX. YEARS AND, IT SEEMS THE TRUMP ERA IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE. DONALD TRUMP, OBVIOUSLY DONNY, LET'S START WITH THE OBVIOUS, RAN DOWN, RIGHT?  I CAN THINK IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS CULTURE OF ONE BRAND THAT HAS GONE FROM 60 TO 0 FASTER AND IN A MORE STUNNING FASHION. WE CAN PROBABLY, BRAND UP BRANDAUN TRIBUTES. I COULD GIVE 25 GRAND ATTRIBUTES. EVERYTHING FROM STEALING THE DOCUMENTS, TO ENDORSING JUST ABOUT EVERY LESION CANDIDATE, TO HIS POLLING NUMBERS, TO THE JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE POSSIBLY GONNA BRING UP ON CRIMINAL CHARGES, TO HIS BUSINESS BEING FOUND ON 17 COUNTS ON EVERY SINGLE JUDGMENT MADE AGAINST HIM. FROM HAVING DINNER WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND ANTISEMITES, HIM SAYING WE SHOULD THROUGHOUT THE CONSTITUTION. I MEAN, IT IS AND. LIST IS COMPLETELY ENDLESS. THERE IS NO BRANDS THAT IS MORE DOWN IN OUR CULTURE RIGHT NOW. AND THE LATEST POLL NUMBERS THAT WE ARE SEEING WITH HIM 20 POINTS BEHIND DESANTIS KIND TO SAY TO PEOPLE THEY FINALLY FIGURED IT. OUT  SO THE FORMER PRESIDENTS BRANDAUN, THE CURRENT PRESIDENT, BRAND.  YEAH, OVER THE YEARS I'VE BEEN A LITTLE CRITICAL OF HIM SAYING THAT HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE HIS MOJO. BUT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PIER BLOCK ATTACKING. THE LEGISLATIVE VICTORIES WHETHER IT IS THE CHIPS, MANUFACTURING, WHETHER IT IS GUN CONTROL, CLIMATE, BUILD BACK BETTER, THE INFLATION ACT, I MEAN NO PRESIDENT HAS GOT MORE DONE IN HIS FIRST TERM PROBABLY SINCE FDR. AND YOU ALSO SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS IN TERMS OF HIS COATTAILS OR THE NEGATIVE COATTAILS OF DONALD TRUMP AS FAR AS THE WAY THE DEMOCRATS HAVE PERFORMED. SO, UNDER THE GUISE OF A BRAND OF QUIET COMPETENCY WE, OBSCENITY, OF STABILITY. YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM A MAJOR BRAND. I DON'T CARE WE ARE COMING FROM. WE  AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS SO FASCINATING IS, AND WE SEE THIS ONCE IN A WHILE WE. JOE BIDEN'S SUPERPOWER POLITICALLY HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED. I REMEMBER WRITING A COLUMN IN THE WASHINGTON POST, EVERYBODY THOUGHT HE WAS FINISHED AFTER IOWA NEW HAMPSHIRE. I SAID, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I AM PROUD OF JOE BIDEN. AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED. HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED ON TWITTER. GOING INTO THE 2020 CAMPAIGN. THERE WERE PEOPLE ALL AROUND BARACK OBAMA THAT DIDN'T WANT HIM TO RUN. THEY WOULD TALK TO ANY REPORTER OFF THE RECORD THEY COULD, TALKING ABOUT HOW HE WASN'T UP TO THE JOB. OF COURSE, YOU HEARD A LOT OF THE SAME TOP FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS. AGAIN, SAYING THAT THIS GUY WAS TAKING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DOWN, AND HE NEEDED TO QUIT. ONCE AGAIN BRAND UP. HE ALWAYS, HE ALWAYS BEATS EXPECTATIONS.  DEMOCRATS NEVER AND DIDN'T IN THE MIDTERMS KNOW WHAT THEY HAD IN JOE BIDEN. THEY HAD SOMEONE WHO WAS A SKILLED POLITICIAN, WHO'S MADE HIS MISTAKES ALONG THE WAY, ALONG DECADES WHO HAS LEARNED FROM THEM WHO KNEW EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE CARED ABOUT. DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE POLLS. HE STAYED FOCUSED ON TWO ISSUES RIGHT BEFORE THE MIDTERMS AND IT WAS ABORTION AND DEMOCRACY. AND, LIKE A LASER, HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ANYBODY. AND, BY THE WAY, PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO CAMPAIGN NEXT. TIM I, MEAN COME ON DEMOCRATS. USE YOUR. AS WE  AND REALLY, ISN'T IT FUNNY, HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED AND YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS THAT WOULD NOT SAY WHETHER THEY THOUGHT HE SHOULD RUN AGAIN IN COMPETITIVE DEMOCRATIC RACES. WHICH IS CRAZY.  THEY ARE STILL SAYING. YET THEY'RE STILL NOT SURE IF THEY WANTED TO RUN AGAIN DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE BEAT DONALD TRUMP ONCE AND HAD THIS RUN IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. ALL RIGHT, DONIE, LET'S KEEP MOVING. BRETT UP TO FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS.  YOU YEAH. AT THE LATEST POLLS. I'M GONNA HEDGE THIS BECAUSE HE RAMMED UP WITH THE SUCCESS HE'S HAD. I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE HIS BRAND VERY MUCH. I THINK HE'S GOT A LOT OF DANGEROUS ATTRIBUTES TO HIM. BUT, LOOK. THIS IS THE GUY THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO THE DANCE WITH TRUMP AND NOT NECESSARILY IN THE WAY WE ENDORSE. NOT NECESSARILY COMING AFTER HIM AT SOME POINT IN TIME THE RUBBER IS GONNA HIT THE ROAD. IN THE LATEST, POLLS WE SEE HIM 20 POINTS AHEAD OF TRUMP WHICH IS AMAZING. HE WON OVERWHELMINGLY IN FLORIDA. HE SEEMS TO BE THAT FAIR HAIRED BOY. HE HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG. HE MIGHT THAT SHRINK IN THE ARMOR IS I THINK THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE HE SAYS, WE NEED TO WIN GUYS. IT IS ABOUT WINNING. AND I'M GOING TO STAND FOR A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS THAT YOU ARE GUYS STANDS FOR, BUT WE ARE GONNA DO IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. WE ARE GONNA TAKE A LOT OF THE VITRIOL OUT. HE IS CLEARLY RIGHT NOW THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY. BUT, LET'S PUT ABOUT ON THIS. YES AND TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE SHOW A LOT. WE KIND OF HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ON THE BIG STAGE. WE HAVEN'T SEEN CANDY TAKE A PUNCH. WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM UNDER THE TYPE OF SCRUTINY ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. SO, RIGHT NOW, ON HIS YEAR YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM A MAJOR BRAND. UP BUT, THIS IS STILL A TBD  AS DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES TO FADE THERE WILL BE INCREASING CALLS FOR HIM TO JUMP INTO THIS RACE. WE'LL SEE IF HE DOES. IT LET'S KEEP MOVING ON OUR BRANDS. LIZ CHENEY THIS YEAR FOR HER WORK ON THE JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE.  YEAH. SHE IS TRULY I THINK THAT THE AMERICAN HERE OF THE YEAR AS FAR AS AMERICANS GO. SHE COST HER JOB. IT'S ONE THING TO KIND OF GO OUT ON THE LINE, AND ONE THING TO STAND UP AND TAKE A STAND. IT IS ANOTHER THING WHEN YOU ARE SACRIFICING. AND THIS IS A WILL PROBABLY SEE THE REPUBLICANS. NOT ONE OF THEM. BECAUSE THEY REALIZE IF THEY DO STAND UP, A LOT OF THEM LOSE THEIR JOB. AND SHE LOST HER JOB. SHE WILL BE A POLITICIAN ON THE SCENE FOR DECADES TO COME. SHE COULD BE PRESIDENTIAL TIMBER IN THE FUTURE. BUT, I THINK THAT HER BRAND IS AS STRONG AS ANY POLITICAL BRAND OUT THERE. AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE HER KUDOS. EVERY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. SHE PUT ON A STUNNING PERFORMANCE IN GENERAL SIX. WE  OFTEN HEAR HOW DIVIDED THE LECTURE IT IS. MAYBE. THEY ARE I BROUGHT UP ANTHONY FAUCI A FEW WEEKS BACK TALKING ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS KEEP BASHING FAUCI. HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON OUT OF 15 PEOPLE PULLED IN A RECENT POLL THAT WAS POSITIVE. NUMBER TWO, THE ONE CLOSEST TO ANTHONY FAUCI, LIZ CHENEY. WE  SHE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF THE PAST YEAR ESPECIALLY, FOR THE COUNTRY. ON THAT FRONT. SOMEONE WHO YOU COULD SAY MAYBE WAS DOING THE OPPOSITE, MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. YOU SAY BRANDON, AND I WONDER THOUGH IF YOUR FEELINGS DON'T MATCH REALITY HERE. BECAUSE, SHE'S ACTUALLY GAINING IN POWER. WE  SHE IS GAINING POWER. BUT I THINK THAT SHE IS GONNA RUN INTO A BUZZSAW. SHE'S COME OUT WITH EVERYTHING FROM, HEY IF I WAS IN CHARGE WE WOULD'VE WON THAT JANUARY SIX. I WOULD'VE HAD GUNS THERE, THINGS LIKE THAT. I JUST THINK THAT WE ARE HEADING INTO A MOMENT OF TIME WITH THAT TYPE OF VITRIOL, THAT TYPE OF HATE, YES YOU GET THE MEDIA TENSION. BUT I THINK AS THE REPUBLICANS, JOE YOU TALK SOMEONE JUMPS ON THE SHOW ABOUT THE LOSING STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLICANS. SHE MAY, HER BRAND SO TO SPEAK AS FAR AS AWARENESS AND POPULARITY IN A VERY NARROW SEGMENT MIGHT BE UP, BUT HER BRAND OF THE NATIONAL STAGE, BEING ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY LONG TERM, I THINK IS-LIMITED. I THINK THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME.  BIG SWAY FOR THE MOMENT THOUGH. WITH INFLUENZA OR KEVIN MCCARTHY.  OH MY GOSH, THAT'S. TO KEVIN, NEVER KEVIN. YOU NEVER. NOW AND, FINALLY JOHNNY. NANCY PELOSI. WE BRAND UP.  YEAH, YOU GUYS SHOWED A COUPLE OF WEEKS JOHN BOEHNER GETTING UP THERE AND CRYING AS HE TALKED ABOUT IT. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE HAD AS AN EFFECTIVE SPEAKER IN MY LIFETIME. SAYING WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT HER, LIKE HER NOT LIKE HER, THE LEVEL OF COMPETENCY, THE WAY SHE KEPT A CAUCUS IN LINE, THE WAY SHE IS HANDLED HERSELF WITH DIGNITY AND EVERY SINGLE MOMENT, SHE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE GREAT SPEAKERS OF ALL-TIME. YOU'VE GOT TO TIP YOUR HAT TO NANCY PELOSI.  WITHOUT QUESTION. WE LET'S MOVE ON TO VOTERS. YOU'RE STARTING A BRAND UP WITH INDEPENDENT VOTERS. WHY DO YOU SAY? THAT  WELL AN INTERESTING PANEL RECENTLY CAME OUT TO ASK PEOPLE TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. MORE PEOPLE IDENTIFY THEM AS INDEPENDENTS AND THEY DO ENOUGH REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS. AND THEN GET INDEPENDENTS HAVE REALLY COME TO BEAR IN THE LAST ELECTION. THE INDEPENDENTS I BELIEVE MORE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP SAVED OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO CAME UP AND SPOKE. AND I THINK INDEPENDENT AS A BRAND IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW. WE ARE NOT, YES WE ARE TWO PARTY SYSTEM, BUT MOST PEOPLE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WARDROBE OF ATTRIBUTES, THEY DON'T LINEUP COMPLETELY WITH A PARTY. I THINK INDEPENDENT IS GOING TO BE A BIGGER BRAND AS WE MOVE FORWARD.  REPUBLICANS BLEW, WHICH WOULD BE A LAB OF MIDTERM ELECTION SEASON, GIVE A BRAND DOWN.  YEAH. JOE, YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT ENOUGH. IT IS JUST, WHAT A LOSING STRATEGY. THE PARTY OF NOTHING. EVEN AFTER ALL OF THESE LOSSES, WHAT DO THEY COME FORWARD WITH? HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE LOST, THEY CAN'T GET, UP AND THE PROBLEM THAT THEY HAVE GOING FORWARD, DONALD TRUMP ALTHOUGH HE SEEMED DISINTEGRATED AS FAR AS HIS BRAND IN POPULARITY, I DON'T SEEM DISAPPEARING. I SEE HIM GOING BACK TO OUR LAST SEGMENT, RUNNING AS AN INDEPENDENT. A VERY DEMOCRATIC INDEPENDENT. AND HE STILL HOLDS THAT. BASE SO, THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. THEY HAVE A MAJOR BRANDING PROBLEM. I THINK IF YOU PULLED 90% OF REPUBLICANS THEY WOULD SAY, WE WANT HIM TO GO AWAY.  THEY ARE STUCK WITH. HIM AND THEY ARE STUCK WITH HIS GRIEVANCE. AND THEY HAVE A PROBLEM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. UNLESS RON DESANTIS CAN REALLY RESCUE THIS PARTY, THIS PARTY IS IN DEEP TROUBLE.  AND THE PROBLEM IS, AGAIN PUTTING IT IN DONNY'S TERM, THEY'RE MICRO-TARGETING. THEY KEEP MICRO-TARGETING TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE BUBBLE. THEY KEEP TRYING TO CONVERT THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY CONVERTED. THEY ARE TALKING TO THEMSELVES. AND SO, WHEN YOU ARE LOSING THE SUBURBS, WHEN YOU'RE LOSING MIDDLE AMERICA, WHEN YOU ARE LOSING SWING VOTERS, WHEN YOU ARE JUST NOT GOING TO WIN ELECTIONS SAYING, YEAH THEY REMAIN FOCUSED ON MICRO-TARGETING. AND I THINK THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS ACTUALLY WAS IN ARIZONA. THE FINAL WEEK OF THE MIDTERM CAMPAIGN. OUT OF ARIZONA, KARI LAKE DECIDED TO ATTACK MCCAIN VOTERS AND SAID, IF YOU ARE A VACATE VOTER. GET OUT OF HERE. I HAVE TO SAY, AS A FORMER POLITICIAN, YOU JUST SHUT. ARE YOU WANT EVERY VOTE. YOU WANT, EVERYBODY ON YOUR SIDE. AND YET, WE KEEP PUSHING PEOPLE AWAY.  YES, THEY DO. AND YOU KNOW ANOTHER ISSUE WHERE THEY DO THAT IS ABORTION, DONIE. IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT POLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, ON DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS, REPUBLICANS EVEN ARE SPLIT ON ABORTION. AND MORE OF THEM ARE FOR WOMEN HAVING THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT. ROE V. WADE, BRAND.  YEAH, I THINK THIS WAS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IN THE LAST ELECTION IN THE POLLS WERE SHOWING. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GET ISSUES. I THINK THIS IS THE TONE DEAFNESS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A SUPREME COURT DECISION, NOT NECESSARILY THE PARTY'S DECISION, BUT. I THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CAUSE OF WE -- FOR DEMOCRATS. I THINK IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT GOING BACKWARDS VERSUS GOING FORWARD. THAT IS A BRAND THAT, AS LONG AS REPUBLICANS ARE STUCK WITH THE ANTI ROE V. WADE, THE ROLLBACK ROE V. WADE, THEIR BRAND STAYS TARNISH. SO YOU KIND OF HAVE TO INTERLOCKED TO THEM.  I'VE GOT TO SAY, THERE ARE, WELL SOME OF THESE THINGS SEEM OBVIOUS TO US NOW AS WE TALK ABOUT ROE V. WADE, IT IS SHOCKING THAT AMERICANS WOULD RESPOND AS OVERWHELMINGLY AS THEY DID. IF YOU LOOK AT POLLS, IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS, IF YOU LOOKED SWING VOTERS WERE, IT IS VERY SURPRISING LOOKING BACK TO SEE JUST HOW DRAMATIC THE BACKLASH. WAS OUR LAST FRIEND, BRANDEN OF THE SEGMENT. IS GLOBAL. AND IF YOU GO BACK A YEAR, IT IS VERY SAFE TO SAY LITERALLY NOBODY WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING. EVEN UKRAINIANS. VLADIMIR PUTIN, BRAND WAY DOWN. SO LEWINSKY, BRAND WAY UP. NOBODY COULD'VE IMAGINED WHEN THOSE TANKS STARTED ROLLING IN AND PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT UKRAINIANS WOULD COLLAPSE IN THREE, FOUR, FIVE DAYS. NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE WOULD BE TALKING AND THIS IS WHERE THE ARROWS WOULD BE POINTING. IN A REALLY DRAMATIC HISTORIC WAY, DONNY.  YEAH, NOT ONLY JUST PUTIN. IT REALLY SHOWS IT UNDER EARTH AND TOOK THE EMBERS CLOSE OFF RUSSIA AS FAR AS NOT BEING THE SUPERPOWER. CERTAINLY IT IS A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY IN SO MANY WAYS. AS YOU, SAID IF THEY WERE CHOOSING UP SIDES IN THE BEGINNING IT'S INHIBITING, ON UKRAINE TO RUSSIA, IT WOULD BE A NO-BRAINER. ZELENSKYY HAS BEEN SO PITCH PERFECT IN THE WAY HE'S HANDLED THE MEDIA. THIS ALSO GOES BACK TO JOE BIDEN AND NATO. ADAM BRING ABOUT THIS OUT OF TIME WITH HIS BRAND. THE NATO COALITION THAT HE PUT TOGETHER. BUT, ZELENSKYY WAS TIME AGA ZIENTS MADE OF THE YEAR RIGHTFULLY SO. PUTIN IS A DAMAGED HURT BRAND. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS EXIT RAMP IS, BUT ZELENSKYY IS AN INTERNATIONAL HERO, AND I THINK TIME AUGUSTINE HAS IT COMPLETELY RIGHT.  WELL, STILL AHEAD ON THE SPECIAL EDITION OF BRAND OF BRANDAUN, DONNEK GIVES US THE TRENDS FOR SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN BUSINESS, SPORTS, AND ENTERTAINMENT. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. ENTERTAINMENT. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. 20221231203737.355|20221231204027.392\",\n",

       "\"WELCOME TO A SPECIAL EDITION OF -- LOOKING BACK IN 25 NEWS MAKERS AND POLITICS, BUSINESS, POP ULTRA, ENTERTAINMENT, AND SPORTS. AND WHETHER THEY WERE UP OR DOWN BY THE END OF THE YEAR. AND, DONNY GEORGE IS HERE TO TAKE US THROUGH THEM ALL. YIKES. A LOT OF BRANDS DOWNS. SOME GROUND. UPS  AND YOU KNOW, THE THING, IS SOME OF THESE ACTUALLY ARE A BIT OBVIOUS. BUT WHAT MAKES IT SO INTERESTING IS, WE'VE GOT JOHNNY. HERE HE'S GOT THAT SPECIAL SAUCE. HE OBVIOUSLY. AN ADVERTISING LEGEND. A BRANDING LEGEND. HE'S GOT THE BRANDING. A NO YOU'VE EVER BEEN OVER TO HIS PLACE. HE HAS THE SUPERCOMPUTER. THE BRANDING SUPERCOMPUTER. WE GO TO THIS GUY TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS UP, WHO IS, DOWN AND WHY.  THERE'S ABOUT 2017 YEARS SCIENTISTS WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK. OUT OF THE WAY THEY ARE, DANISH BUT THAT'S JUST. SOMEHOW THEY KIND OF GOT TOGETHER. AND THEY WORK WITH THE SUPERCOMPUTER. THEY USE A GOOGLE MACHINE, ALSO. THEY DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. GEORGE, SAID A LOT OF THESE. A LOT OF TIMES WE DO THIS ON A WEEKLY BASIS. I KIND OF DO FUNNY THINGS LIKE BILL BEAT MARTINIS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. I TRIED TO JUST, WHEN WE LOOK AT A YEAR IN 25 OF THEM. WE CAN UPENDED TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE KIND OF BASICALLY THE TWO-DAY STEWARDS OF MOURNING  A YEAR AND RAP WOULD BE NEGLIGENT NOT TO. DO IT  AND YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE HE'S GOT THE DOUBLE BREASTED BLAZER ON SO IT'S GAME. ON  IT IS GAME DAY. AND I WILL TELL, YOU IF THE CHOICE OF THE DOUBLE BREASTED BLAZER, THE DANISH SCIENTISTS IN THEIR LAP JACKETS, IN THEIR LAB COATS WERE THE ONES THAT TOLD HIM TO WEAR THAT. THAT IS ALL WE ARE GOING TO SAY ABOUT THE DANISH SCIENTISTS. WE WILL LEAVE IT THERE. I WANT TO START WITH DONALD TRUMP. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THAT IS OBVIOUS BUT NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND I WILL TELL YOU. WHY THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN THROUGH A REMARKABLE SIX YEARS. AN EXTRAORDINARY SIX. YEARS AND, IT SEEMS THE TRUMP ERA IS DRAWING TO A CLOSE. DONALD TRUMP, OBVIOUSLY DONNY, LET'S START WITH THE OBVIOUS, RAN DOWN, RIGHT?  I CAN THINK IN THE HISTORY OF POLITICS CULTURE OF ONE BRAND THAT HAS GONE FROM 60 TO 0 FASTER AND IN A MORE STUNNING FASHION. WE CAN PROBABLY, BRAND UP BRANDAUN TRIBUTES. I COULD GIVE 25 GRAND ATTRIBUTES. EVERYTHING FROM STEALING THE DOCUMENTS, TO ENDORSING JUST ABOUT EVERY LESION CANDIDATE, TO HIS POLLING NUMBERS, TO THE JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE POSSIBLY GONNA BRING UP ON CRIMINAL CHARGES, TO HIS BUSINESS BEING FOUND ON 17 COUNTS ON EVERY SINGLE JUDGMENT MADE AGAINST HIM. FROM HAVING DINNER WITH WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND ANTISEMITES, HIM SAYING WE SHOULD THROUGHOUT THE CONSTITUTION. I MEAN, IT IS AND. LIST IS COMPLETELY ENDLESS. THERE IS NO BRANDS THAT IS MORE DOWN IN OUR CULTURE RIGHT NOW. AND THE LATEST POLL NUMBERS THAT WE ARE SEEING WITH HIM 20 POINTS BEHIND DESANTIS KIND TO SAY TO PEOPLE THEY FINALLY FIGURED IT. OUT  SO THE FORMER PRESIDENTS BRANDAUN, THE CURRENT PRESIDENT, BRAND.  YEAH, OVER THE YEARS I'VE BEEN A LITTLE CRITICAL OF HIM SAYING THAT HE DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE HIS MOJO. BUT, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PIER BLOCK ATTACKING. THE LEGISLATIVE VICTORIES WHETHER IT IS THE CHIPS, MANUFACTURING, WHETHER IT IS GUN CONTROL, CLIMATE, BUILD BACK BETTER, THE INFLATION ACT, I MEAN NO PRESIDENT HAS GOT MORE DONE IN HIS FIRST TERM PROBABLY SINCE FDR. AND YOU ALSO SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS IN TERMS OF HIS COATTAILS OR THE NEGATIVE COATTAILS OF DONALD TRUMP AS FAR AS THE WAY THE DEMOCRATS HAVE PERFORMED. SO, UNDER THE GUISE OF A BRAND OF QUIET COMPETENCY WE, OBSCENITY, OF STABILITY. YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM A MAJOR BRAND. I DON'T CARE WE ARE COMING FROM. WE  AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS SO FASCINATING IS, AND WE SEE THIS ONCE IN A WHILE WE. JOE BIDEN'S SUPERPOWER POLITICALLY HAS ALWAYS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED. I REMEMBER WRITING A COLUMN IN THE WASHINGTON POST, EVERYBODY THOUGHT HE WAS FINISHED AFTER IOWA NEW HAMPSHIRE. I SAID, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, I AM PROUD OF JOE BIDEN. AND HE'S ALWAYS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED. HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED ON TWITTER. GOING INTO THE 2020 CAMPAIGN. THERE WERE PEOPLE ALL AROUND BARACK OBAMA THAT DIDN'T WANT HIM TO RUN. THEY WOULD TALK TO ANY REPORTER OFF THE RECORD THEY COULD, TALKING ABOUT HOW HE WASN'T UP TO THE JOB. OF COURSE, YOU HEARD A LOT OF THE SAME TOP FROM THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY GOING INTO THE MIDTERMS. AGAIN, SAYING THAT THIS GUY WAS TAKING THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY DOWN, AND HE NEEDED TO QUIT. ONCE AGAIN BRAND UP. HE ALWAYS, HE ALWAYS BEATS EXPECTATIONS.  DEMOCRATS NEVER AND DIDN'T IN THE MIDTERMS KNOW WHAT THEY HAD IN JOE BIDEN. THEY HAD SOMEONE WHO WAS A SKILLED POLITICIAN, WHO'S MADE HIS MISTAKES ALONG THE WAY, ALONG DECADES WHO HAS LEARNED FROM THEM WHO KNEW EXACTLY WHAT PEOPLE CARED ABOUT. DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE POLLS. HE STAYED FOCUSED ON TWO ISSUES RIGHT BEFORE THE MIDTERMS AND IT WAS ABORTION AND DEMOCRACY. AND, LIKE A LASER, HE DIDN'T LISTEN TO ANYBODY. AND, BY THE WAY, PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO CAMPAIGN NEXT. TIM I, MEAN COME ON DEMOCRATS. USE YOUR. AS WE  AND REALLY, ISN'T IT FUNNY, HE WAS MOCKED AND RIDICULED AND YOU HAVE DEMOCRATS THAT WOULD NOT SAY WHETHER THEY THOUGHT HE SHOULD RUN AGAIN IN COMPETITIVE DEMOCRATIC RACES. WHICH IS CRAZY.  THEY ARE STILL SAYING. YET THEY'RE STILL NOT SURE IF THEY WANTED TO RUN AGAIN DESPITE THE FACT THAT HE BEAT DONALD TRUMP ONCE AND HAD THIS RUN IN THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS. ALL RIGHT, DONIE, LET'S KEEP MOVING. BRETT UP TO FLORIDA GOVERNOR RON DESANTIS.  YOU YEAH. AT THE LATEST POLLS. I'M GONNA HEDGE THIS BECAUSE HE RAMMED UP WITH THE SUCCESS HE'S HAD. I PERSONALLY DON'T LIKE HIS BRAND VERY MUCH. I THINK HE'S GOT A LOT OF DANGEROUS ATTRIBUTES TO HIM. BUT, LOOK. THIS IS THE GUY THAT HAS BEEN ABLE TO DO THE DANCE WITH TRUMP AND NOT NECESSARILY IN THE WAY WE ENDORSE. NOT NECESSARILY COMING AFTER HIM AT SOME POINT IN TIME THE RUBBER IS GONNA HIT THE ROAD. IN THE LATEST, POLLS WE SEE HIM 20 POINTS AHEAD OF TRUMP WHICH IS AMAZING. HE WON OVERWHELMINGLY IN FLORIDA. HE SEEMS TO BE THAT FAIR HAIRED BOY. HE HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING WRONG. HE MIGHT THAT SHRINK IN THE ARMOR IS I THINK THIS IS THE MOMENT WHERE HE SAYS, WE NEED TO WIN GUYS. IT IS ABOUT WINNING. AND I'M GOING TO STAND FOR A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS THAT YOU ARE GUYS STANDS FOR, BUT WE ARE GONNA DO IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY. WE ARE GONNA TAKE A LOT OF THE VITRIOL OUT. HE IS CLEARLY RIGHT NOW THE FUTURE OF THE PARTY. BUT, LET'S PUT ABOUT ON THIS. YES AND TALKED ABOUT THIS ON THE SHOW A LOT. WE KIND OF HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ON THE BIG STAGE. WE HAVEN'T SEEN CANDY TAKE A PUNCH. WE HAVEN'T SEEN HIM UNDER THE TYPE OF SCRUTINY ON THE NATIONAL STAGE. SO, RIGHT NOW, ON HIS YEAR YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM A MAJOR BRAND. UP BUT, THIS IS STILL A TBD  AS DONALD TRUMP CONTINUES TO FADE THERE WILL BE INCREASING CALLS FOR HIM TO JUMP INTO THIS RACE. WE'LL SEE IF HE DOES. IT LET'S KEEP MOVING ON OUR BRANDS. LIZ CHENEY THIS YEAR FOR HER WORK ON THE JANUARY SIX COMMITTEE.  YEAH. SHE IS TRULY I THINK THAT THE AMERICAN HERE OF THE YEAR AS FAR AS AMERICANS GO. SHE COST HER JOB. IT'S ONE THING TO KIND OF GO OUT ON THE LINE, AND ONE THING TO STAND UP AND TAKE A STAND. IT IS ANOTHER THING WHEN YOU ARE SACRIFICING. AND THIS IS A WILL PROBABLY SEE THE REPUBLICANS. NOT ONE OF THEM. BECAUSE THEY REALIZE IF THEY DO STAND UP, A LOT OF THEM LOSE THEIR JOB. AND SHE LOST HER JOB. SHE WILL BE A POLITICIAN ON THE SCENE FOR DECADES TO COME. SHE COULD BE PRESIDENTIAL TIMBER IN THE FUTURE. BUT, I THINK THAT HER BRAND IS AS STRONG AS ANY POLITICAL BRAND OUT THERE. AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE HER KUDOS. EVERY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. SHE PUT ON A STUNNING PERFORMANCE IN GENERAL SIX. WE  OFTEN HEAR HOW DIVIDED THE LECTURE IT IS. MAYBE. THEY ARE I BROUGHT UP ANTHONY FAUCI A FEW WEEKS BACK TALKING ABOUT HOW REPUBLICANS KEEP BASHING FAUCI. HE WAS THE ONLY PERSON OUT OF 15 PEOPLE PULLED IN A RECENT POLL THAT WAS POSITIVE. NUMBER TWO, THE ONE CLOSEST TO ANTHONY FAUCI, LIZ CHENEY. WE  SHE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF THE PAST YEAR ESPECIALLY, FOR THE COUNTRY. ON THAT FRONT. SOMEONE WHO YOU COULD SAY MAYBE WAS DOING THE OPPOSITE, MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE. YOU SAY BRANDON, AND I WONDER THOUGH IF YOUR FEELINGS DON'T MATCH REALITY HERE. BECAUSE, SHE'S ACTUALLY GAINING IN POWER. WE  SHE IS GAINING POWER. BUT I THINK THAT SHE IS GONNA RUN INTO A BUZZSAW. SHE'S COME OUT WITH EVERYTHING FROM, HEY IF I WAS IN CHARGE WE WOULD'VE WON THAT JANUARY SIX. I WOULD'VE HAD GUNS THERE, THINGS LIKE THAT. I JUST THINK THAT WE ARE HEADING INTO A MOMENT OF TIME WITH THAT TYPE OF VITRIOL, THAT TYPE OF HATE, YES YOU GET THE MEDIA TENSION. BUT I THINK AS THE REPUBLICANS, JOE YOU TALK SOMEONE JUMPS ON THE SHOW ABOUT THE LOSING STRATEGY OF THE REPUBLICANS. SHE MAY, HER BRAND SO TO SPEAK AS FAR AS AWARENESS AND POPULARITY IN A VERY NARROW SEGMENT MIGHT BE UP, BUT HER BRAND OF THE NATIONAL STAGE, BEING ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY LONG TERM, I THINK IS-LIMITED. I THINK THIS IS A MOMENT IN TIME.  BIG SWAY FOR THE MOMENT THOUGH. WITH INFLUENZA OR KEVIN MCCARTHY.  OH MY GOSH, THAT'S. TO KEVIN, NEVER KEVIN. YOU NEVER. NOW AND, FINALLY JOHNNY. NANCY PELOSI. WE BRAND UP.  YEAH, YOU GUYS SHOWED A COUPLE OF WEEKS JOHN BOEHNER GETTING UP THERE AND CRYING AS HE TALKED ABOUT IT. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE HAD AS AN EFFECTIVE SPEAKER IN MY LIFETIME. SAYING WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT HER, LIKE HER NOT LIKE HER, THE LEVEL OF COMPETENCY, THE WAY SHE KEPT A CAUCUS IN LINE, THE WAY SHE IS HANDLED HERSELF WITH DIGNITY AND EVERY SINGLE MOMENT, SHE WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS ONE OF THE GREAT SPEAKERS OF ALL-TIME. YOU'VE GOT TO TIP YOUR HAT TO NANCY PELOSI.  WITHOUT QUESTION. WE LET'S MOVE ON TO VOTERS. YOU'RE STARTING A BRAND UP WITH INDEPENDENT VOTERS. WHY DO YOU SAY? THAT  WELL AN INTERESTING PANEL RECENTLY CAME OUT TO ASK PEOPLE TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. MORE PEOPLE IDENTIFY THEM AS INDEPENDENTS AND THEY DO ENOUGH REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS. AND THEN GET INDEPENDENTS HAVE REALLY COME TO BEAR IN THE LAST ELECTION. THE INDEPENDENTS I BELIEVE MORE THAN ANY OTHER GROUP SAVED OUR DEMOCRACY. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO CAME UP AND SPOKE. AND I THINK INDEPENDENT AS A BRAND IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW. WE ARE NOT, YES WE ARE TWO PARTY SYSTEM, BUT MOST PEOPLE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WARDROBE OF ATTRIBUTES, THEY DON'T LINEUP COMPLETELY WITH A PARTY. I THINK INDEPENDENT IS GOING TO BE A BIGGER BRAND AS WE MOVE FORWARD.  REPUBLICANS BLEW, WHICH WOULD BE A LAB OF MIDTERM ELECTION SEASON, GIVE A BRAND DOWN.  YEAH. JOE, YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT ENOUGH. IT IS JUST, WHAT A LOSING STRATEGY. THE PARTY OF NOTHING. EVEN AFTER ALL OF THESE LOSSES, WHAT DO THEY COME FORWARD WITH? HUNTER BIDEN LAPTOP. THE REPUBLICANS HAVE LOST, THEY CAN'T GET, UP AND THE PROBLEM THAT THEY HAVE GOING FORWARD, DONALD TRUMP ALTHOUGH HE SEEMED DISINTEGRATED AS FAR AS HIS BRAND IN POPULARITY, I DON'T SEEM DISAPPEARING. I SEE HIM GOING BACK TO OUR LAST SEGMENT, RUNNING AS AN INDEPENDENT. A VERY DEMOCRATIC INDEPENDENT. AND HE STILL HOLDS THAT. BASE SO, THEY HAVE A PROBLEM. THEY HAVE A MAJOR BRANDING PROBLEM. I THINK IF YOU PULLED 90% OF REPUBLICANS THEY WOULD SAY, WE WANT HIM TO GO AWAY.  THEY ARE STUCK WITH. HIM AND THEY ARE STUCK WITH HIS GRIEVANCE. AND THEY HAVE A PROBLEM FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. UNLESS RON DESANTIS CAN REALLY RESCUE THIS PARTY, THIS PARTY IS IN DEEP TROUBLE.  AND THE PROBLEM IS, AGAIN PUTTING IT IN DONNY'S TERM, THEY'RE MICRO-TARGETING. THEY KEEP MICRO-TARGETING TO PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE BUBBLE. THEY KEEP TRYING TO CONVERT THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY CONVERTED. THEY ARE TALKING TO THEMSELVES. AND SO, WHEN YOU ARE LOSING THE SUBURBS, WHEN YOU'RE LOSING MIDDLE AMERICA, WHEN YOU ARE LOSING SWING VOTERS, WHEN YOU ARE JUST NOT GOING TO WIN ELECTIONS SAYING, YEAH THEY REMAIN FOCUSED ON MICRO-TARGETING. AND I THINK THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THIS ACTUALLY WAS IN ARIZONA. THE FINAL WEEK OF THE MIDTERM CAMPAIGN. OUT OF ARIZONA, KARI LAKE DECIDED TO ATTACK MCCAIN VOTERS AND SAID, IF YOU ARE A VACATE VOTER. GET OUT OF HERE. I HAVE TO SAY, AS A FORMER POLITICIAN, YOU JUST SHUT. ARE YOU WANT EVERY VOTE. YOU WANT, EVERYBODY ON YOUR SIDE. AND YET, WE KEEP PUSHING PEOPLE AWAY.  YES, THEY DO. AND YOU KNOW ANOTHER ISSUE WHERE THEY DO THAT IS ABORTION, DONIE. IF YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT POLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, ON DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHICS, REPUBLICANS EVEN ARE SPLIT ON ABORTION. AND MORE OF THEM ARE FOR WOMEN HAVING THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT. ROE V. WADE, BRAND.  YEAH, I THINK THIS WAS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT IN THE LAST ELECTION IN THE POLLS WERE SHOWING. IT WAS ONE OF THOSE GET ISSUES. I THINK THIS IS THE TONE DEAFNESS OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A SUPREME COURT DECISION, NOT NECESSARILY THE PARTY'S DECISION, BUT. I THINK THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CAUSE OF WE -- FOR DEMOCRATS. I THINK IT SPEAKS VOLUMES ABOUT GOING BACKWARDS VERSUS GOING FORWARD. THAT IS A BRAND THAT, AS LONG AS REPUBLICANS ARE STUCK WITH THE ANTI ROE V. WADE, THE ROLLBACK ROE V. WADE, THEIR BRAND STAYS TARNISH. SO YOU KIND OF HAVE TO INTERLOCKED TO THEM.  I'VE GOT TO SAY, THERE ARE, WELL SOME OF THESE THINGS SEEM OBVIOUS TO US NOW AS WE TALK ABOUT ROE V. WADE, IT IS SHOCKING THAT AMERICANS WOULD RESPOND AS OVERWHELMINGLY AS THEY DID. IF YOU LOOK AT POLLS, IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WAS, IF YOU LOOKED SWING VOTERS WERE, IT IS VERY SURPRISING LOOKING BACK TO SEE JUST HOW DRAMATIC THE BACKLASH. WAS OUR LAST FRIEND, BRANDEN OF THE SEGMENT. IS GLOBAL. AND IF YOU GO BACK A YEAR, IT IS VERY SAFE TO SAY LITERALLY NOBODY WOULD HAVE SEEN THIS COMING. EVEN UKRAINIANS. VLADIMIR PUTIN, BRAND WAY DOWN. SO LEWINSKY, BRAND WAY UP. NOBODY COULD'VE IMAGINED WHEN THOSE TANKS STARTED ROLLING IN AND PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT UKRAINIANS WOULD COLLAPSE IN THREE, FOUR, FIVE DAYS. NOBODY WOULD BELIEVE THAT AT THE END OF THE YEAR WE WOULD BE TALKING AND THIS IS WHERE THE ARROWS WOULD BE POINTING. IN A REALLY DRAMATIC HISTORIC WAY, DONNY.  YEAH, NOT ONLY JUST PUTIN. IT REALLY SHOWS IT UNDER EARTH AND TOOK THE EMBERS CLOSE OFF RUSSIA AS FAR AS NOT BEING THE SUPERPOWER. CERTAINLY IT IS A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY IN SO MANY WAYS. AS YOU, SAID IF THEY WERE CHOOSING UP SIDES IN THE BEGINNING IT'S INHIBITING, ON UKRAINE TO RUSSIA, IT WOULD BE A NO-BRAINER. ZELENSKYY HAS BEEN SO PITCH PERFECT IN THE WAY HE'S HANDLED THE MEDIA. THIS ALSO GOES BACK TO JOE BIDEN AND NATO. ADAM BRING ABOUT THIS OUT OF TIME WITH HIS BRAND. THE NATO COALITION THAT HE PUT TOGETHER. BUT, ZELENSKYY WAS TIME AGA ZIENTS MADE OF THE YEAR RIGHTFULLY SO. PUTIN IS A DAMAGED HURT BRAND. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HIS EXIT RAMP IS, BUT ZELENSKYY IS AN INTERNATIONAL HERO, AND I THINK TIME AUGUSTINE HAS IT COMPLETELY RIGHT.  WELL, STILL AHEAD ON THE SPECIAL EDITION OF BRAND OF BRANDAUN, DONNEK GIVES US THE TRENDS FOR SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN BUSINESS, SPORTS, AND ENTERTAINMENT. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. ENTERTAINMENT. WE WILL BE RIGHT BACK. 20221231203737.355|20221231204027.392\""
